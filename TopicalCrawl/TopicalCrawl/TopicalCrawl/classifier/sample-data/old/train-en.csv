1	bromwell high is a cartoon comedy .  it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life ,  such as  " teachers "  .  my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is  " teachers "  .  the scramble to survive financially ,  the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp ,  the pettiness of the whole situation ,  all remind me of the schools i knew and their students .  when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school ,  i immediately recalled  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  at  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  high .  a classic line :  inspector :  i'm here to sack one of your teachers .  student :  welcome to bromwell high .  i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched .  what a pity that it isn't !
1	homelessness  ( or houselessness as george carlin stated )  has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school ,  work ,  or vote for the matter .  most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism ,  the war on iraq ,  pressuring kids to succeed ,  technology ,  the elections ,  inflation ,  or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets .   but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home ,  the entertainment sets ,  a bathroom ,  pictures on the wall ,  a computer ,  and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless ?  that is goddard bolt's lesson .   mel brooks  ( who directs )  who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival  ( jeffery tambor )  to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries ;  if bolt succeeds ,  he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings .  the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk .  he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly  ( lesley ann warren )  an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home ,  and her pals sailor  ( howard morris )  and fumes  ( teddy wilson )  who are already used to the streets .  they're survivors .  bolt isn't .  he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight ,  kill or be killed .   while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot ,  i found  " life stinks "  to be one of mel brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy ,  it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles ,  young frankenstein ,  or spaceballs for the matter ,  to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money .  maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money .   or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .
1	brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren .  best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen ,  and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none .  the corn on face is a classic ,  as good as anything in blazing saddles .  the take on lawyers is also superb .  after being accused of being a turncoat ,  selling out his boss ,  and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently  " i'm a lawyer "  he says .  three funny words .  jeffrey tambor ,  a favorite from the later larry sanders show ,  is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto .  his character is more malevolent than usual .  the hospital scene ,  and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site ,  are all-time classics .  look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting  ( one bleeds )  .  this movie gets better each time i see it  ( which is quite often )  .
1	this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon .  sure ,  its flawed .  it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  ( unlike ,  say ,  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers ,  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots )  .  many of the jokes fall flat .  but still ,  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not ,  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive .  its not the fisher king ,  but its not crap ,  either .  my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  ( i love mel as a director and writer ,  not so much as a lead )  .
1	this is not the typical mel brooks film .  it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable .  leslie ann warren made the movie ,  she is such a fantastic ,  under-rated actress .  there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more ,  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so ,  but all in all ,  this is worth the price to rent and see it .  the acting was good overall ,  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience .  again ,  warren was the best actor in the movie ,  but  " fume "  and  " sailor "  both played their parts well .
1	this isn't the comedic robin williams ,  nor is it the quirky/insane robin williams of recent thriller fame .  this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization ,  mixed with robin's new love of the thriller .  but this isn't a thriller ,  per se .  this is more a mystery/suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper .   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin ,  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report ,  until william's character gets close to achieving his goal .   i must say that i was highly entertained ,  though this movie fails to teach ,  guide ,  inspect ,  or amuse .  it felt more like i was watching a guy  ( williams )  ,  as he was actually performing the actions ,  from a third person perspective .  in other words ,  it felt real ,  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story .   all in all ,  it's worth a watch ,  though it's definitely not friday/saturday night fare .   it rates a 7 . 7/10 from .  .  .   the fiend  :  .
1	yes its an art .  .  .  to successfully make a slow paced thriller .   the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening .   fine performance by robin williams .  the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film .  however ,  the core plot is very engaging .  the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering .  the direction is good .  use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good .   very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story !
1	in this  " critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events ,  gabriel  ( robin williams )  ,  a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host ,  becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother  ( toni collette )  .  when troubling questions arise about this boy's  ( story )  ,  however ,  gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret "  according to film's official synopsis .   you really should stop reading these comments ,  and watch the film now .  .  .   the  " how did he lose his leg ?  "  ending ,  with ms .  collette planning her new life ,  should be chopped off ,  and sent to  " deleted scenes "  land .  it's overkill .  the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious ,  by the time mr .  williams returns to new york .  possibly ,  her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the  " highway "  or  " video tape "  scenes .  the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a  " director's cut "  ?    williams and bobby cannavale  ( as jess )  don't seem ,  initially ,  believable as a couple .  a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage .  otherwise ,  the cast is exemplary .  williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization ,  and not a  " gay impersonation "  .  sandra oh  ( as anna )  ,  joe morton  ( as ashe )  ,  and rory culkin  ( pete logand )  are all perfect .   best of all ,  collette's  " donna "  belongs in the creepy hall of fame .  ms .  oh is correct in saying collette might be ,   " you know ,  like that guy from 'psycho' .  "  there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women ,  due to a slighter dispersion of roles ;  certainly ,  they could have noticed collette with some award consideration .  she is that good .  and ,  director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful .   finally ,  writers stettner ,  armistead maupin ,  and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere .   ******* the night listener  ( 1/21/06 )  patrick stettner ~ robin williams ,  toni collette ,  sandra oh ,  rory culkin
1	the night listener  ( 2006 )  **1/2 robin williams ,  toni collette ,  bobby cannavale ,  rory culkin ,  joe morton ,  sandra oh ,  john cullum ,  lisa emery ,  becky ann baker .   ( dir :  patrick stettner )    hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance .   what is it about celebrities and fans ?  what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm ?    in the latest derange fan scenario ,  based on true events no less ,  williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one ,  who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand  ( culkin )  who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe  ( morton )  who gives it to no one to read for himself .    no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna  ( collette giving an excellent performance )  who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids .  naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess  ( cannavale )  whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate .   written by armistead maupin  ( who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner )  and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does .  it helps that williams gives a stand-out ,  low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him  ( the one thing that has escaped his own reality )  and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core .   however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner ,  it pays to listen to your own inner voice :  be careful of what you hope for .
1	you know ,  robin williams ,  god bless him ,  is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade  ( with perhaps the exception of  " death to smoochy "  ,  which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic )  .  the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic ,  especially  " insomnia "  and  " one hour photo "  .   " the night listener "  ,  despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release ,  is among his best work ,  period .   this is a very chilling story ,  even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter .  the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed .  in high school ,  i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson ,  who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result .  i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist .  when i saw this movie ,  the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind .   toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic  " caretaker "  .  her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like  " little miss sunshine "  .  there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me .  it takes a good actress to play that sort of role ,  and it's this understated  ( yet well reviewed )  role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award  ( as of 2008 )  .  it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this ,  and it's scary too .   this is a good ,  dark film that i highly recommend .  be prepared to be unsettled ,  though ,  because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end .
1	i liked the film .  some of the action scenes were very interesting ,  tense and well done .  i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it .  a very tense action scene that seemed well done .   some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography ,  unusual colors ,  or interesting angles .  also the film is funny is several parts .  i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too .  i'd give the film an 8 out of 10 .
1	when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves .  that being said ,  we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood .  .  .   writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded !    with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life ( jess )  and the world around him ( donna )  .   as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably .  the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward .   it's to bad that most people will avoid this film .  i only say that because the average american will probably think  " robin williams in a serious role ?  that didn't work before !  "  please give this movie a chance !  robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people .  like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art .   oh and before i forget ,  i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in .  he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence .  it's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now !  !   s~
1	there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times .  constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis ,  have kept psychologists ,  counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades .  occasionally ,  some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence .  that is the premise of the film entitled  "  the night listner .  "  it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon  ( robin williams )  who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles .  perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself .  feeling abandoned by both his lover jess  ( bobby cannavale )  and his and best friend  ( joe morton )  ,  he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation .  it is here ,  a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help .  noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter  ( rory culkin )  .  in reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents ,  noon is captivated and wants to help .  however ,  things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare .  this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d .  logand ,  sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop ,  this might be comical .  instead ,  this may prove to be one of william's more serious performances .  ***
1	i enjoyed the night listener very much .  it's one of the better movies of the summer .   robin williams gives one of his best performances .  in fact ,  the entire cast was very good .  all played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little .  sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch .  toni collette is great as the mom ,  and never goes over the top .  everyone is very believable .   it's a short movie ,  just under an hour and a half .  i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version .  i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie .   the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion ,  which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well .   do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads .  it is not a hitchcockian thriller .  see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well .  if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed .   my only complaint with the movie was the ending .  the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination ,  but this is a minor quibble .
1	the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles ,  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie .  i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before .  some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie ,  but i think it's the great plus of the movie .  it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 .  it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content ,  dramatic feeling .  this is no americanized movie .  neither is it a predictable movie .  you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be .  this is no excellent movie that has everything ,  but hell ,  it's a damn good and very original movie .
1	like one of the previous commenters said ,  this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery .  such a waste because collette's performance was eerie and williams was believable .  i just kept waiting for it to get better .  i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director ,  it could have just been the film .  it came across as a canadian movie ,  something like the first few seasons of x-files .  not cheap ,  just hokey .  also ,  it needed a little more suspense .  something that makes you jump off your seat .  the movie reached that moment then faded away ;  kind of like a false climax .  i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the  " reality "  of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy .  this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems .
1	the night listener held my attention ,  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy  ( rory culkin )  who is very ill .  williams has never met the boy in person ,  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone .  however ,  williams' ex-boyfriend  ( nice job from bobby cannavale )  raises doubt about the boy ,  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person .  what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect .  i will leave it at that .  toni collette also stars .   i enjoyed this film ,  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother .  sandra oh also starred as williams' friend .  the night listener is inspired by actual events ,  and it has a somber ,  almost creepy silence throughout .  at times it is predictable ,  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic ,  but i liked it anyway .  i enjoy williams in roles like this ,  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me .  recommended .  8/10
1	popular radio storyteller gabriel no one ( robin williams , scraggy and speaking in hushed , hypnotic tones )  becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from wisconsin named pete logand ( rory culkin )  , who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents .  to boot , pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still , since his partner jess ( bobby cannavale , good ) happens to be a survivor of hiv himself .    he also acquaints himself with pete's guardian , a woman named donna ( toni collette , brilliant !  ) and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin , he discovers some secrets he was ( naturally ) not prepared to find .   based on real events that happened to armistead maupin ( who co-wrote the screenplay with terry anderson ) and directed by patrick stetner , this film moves a lot faster ( 90 min .  , maybe a few minutes longer ) than one might think a movie of this genre would run .  that's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear .  it's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story .  i'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that , if you are not familiar with mr . maupin's works or his personal story , you feel a little bit out of the loop here .  still , the performances by williams (  i would've loved to heard more of his narration , personally )  , collette , cannavale , culkin and much of the supporting cast ( the waitress at the restaurant collete's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has !  ) are top-notch and the mood established here--namely , the chilly , lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york--give a terrific framing for this story .  it may have ends that don't tie together particularly well , but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with .
1	if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing .  the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery ,  and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about .  however ,  there is not much tension ,  and williams' mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy .   collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear .  the production felt rushed and holes are apparent .  it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort .  the book is probably better .   one thing is certain :  taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .
1	i absolutely loved this film !  i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it .  i was completely enthralled through every second !    i found the story gripping ,  the acting intense ,  and the direction spot-on .  i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie .  even though there was nothing  " scary "  about the story itself ,  i was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening .    i found that there were so many perfect choices made .  .  . the casting ,  the script ,  the little bits of humor sprinkled in it .  there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill ,  but it never did ,  and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately .  .  . and for the last number of years .
1	this night listener is better than people are generally saying .  it has weaknesses ,  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis ,  no doubt ,  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this .  the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  " this happened to a friend of a friend of mine "  ghost stories .  one big complaint about the movie is the pacing :  but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate .  everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility ,  and real life just sort of plods alongno ?  so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations ,  no  " showdown "  scenes .  thank heaven .  you have to get into the zone when watching this movie ,  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  ( conventionally ) good movie .  williams isn't terrific ,  but he easily meets the needs of the story ,  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic  (  " no one "  )  as he is the everyman ,  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story .  toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar  ( even if she maybe shouldn't win it )  .  give it a shot .  for quality and content alone ,  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .
1	somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless ,  fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u . s .  treasury agent  ( david morse )  to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief/hacker  ( doug hutchinson )  ,  who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead .    " bait "  marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua  (  " the replacement killers "  )  and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie .  what the two films have in common is the action sequences ,  which are flat-out excellent .   foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning ,  but throughout the film ,  i began to catch on .  hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in  " marathon man "  .  morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost .
1	when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky ,  and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong .  while every movie has its flaws ,  the night listener had an exceptionally low count .   if you read the last review  ( it was hard ,  since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie )  ,  you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done .  unfortunately ,  if you read more than 3 lines into that same review ,  you discovered the poster's reason for disdain :  he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay  ( or that the production team smokes crack .  .  . apparently )  .   so ,  despite the fact that i have never written a review before ,  i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits ,  not the sexual orientation of its director .  let's go over a quick checklist first :  1 .  great plot ?  absolutely .  i won't give a shred of it away ,  but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials .  this is a thriller ,  not a horror ,  and it should be approached as such .  the story really will amaze you ,  even more so because it's true  ( and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events )  .   2 .  wonderful acting ?  oh yes .  robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast ,  and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago .  he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener ,  playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of .  .  . well ,  i'll let you see for yourself .   3 .  excellent direction ?  certainly .  now ,  unlike the other poster to which i referred ,  i actually know something about direction .  i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years .  of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference  ( the only thing that matters is if you like the direction )  ,  but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant .  .  . for example :  not the sexual orientation of the director  ( or the alleged drug habits of the production team ,  lol )  .   patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark ,  and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of  " tension and release "  rather than the messy ,  fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today .  some people can truly show you a story through their camera ,  while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera .  i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized ,  which is as an eyeball through which we all see .   4 .  lighting ,  cinematography ,  and editing ?  great all around .  i've already wrote so much ,  and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs ,  so i'll just wrap it up .   in short ,  go see this movie .  don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it ,  especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post .  enjoy the show !  -ben
1	the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico .  this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch .  karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval ,  an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty ,  greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will .  pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place .  onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of  " tintorera "  infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character .  the clunky ,  plodding  ( non ) direction ,  trite by-the-numbers script ,  ugly ,  washed-out cinematography ,  ridiculous murder set pieces  ( a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon !  )  ,  overwrought string score ,  morbid gloom-doom atmosphere ,  largely lousy acting  ( karloff notably excepted )  ,  cheesy mild gore ,  poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm .  a real campy hoot .
1	this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces  (  " the fall of the house of usher "  ,   " dance of death "   ( poem )   )  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end .  it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  ( for example ,   " the cat and the canary "  ,   " the old dark house "  ,   " night of terror "  and so on )  .  boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests .  he dies early in the film  ( or does he  ?   )  and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences .  i won't go into too much detail here ,  but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries .   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room .   dan basinger 8/10
1	aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's .  also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people  ( he used to kill pregnant women ,  and then he set them on fire )  .   this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts .    " aro tolbukhin "  is a serious work ,  so analytical ,  it's not morbid at all .  such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster .   *my rate :  7/10
1	after seeing several movies of villaronga ,  i had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters ,  forgetting about a rhythm of the movie .  that is why ,  though having good critics ,  his movies never caught the broad audience attention .  in aro he follows the same line ,  but really improved on the rhythm ,  especially in the end of the movie .  frankly speaking ,  i slept through the first part ,  cause though the first part gives necessary information ,  it is really slow .  nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga .   recommended .
1	there's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin .  en la mente del asesino  ( inside the killer's mind )  ,  that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning .  let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really ,  really great done .  it´s made with super 8 ,  black and white shots ,  35 milimeters ,  color ,  interviews ,  flashbacks .  aro tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa ,  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering ,  did he really ever existed ?  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala ,  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people .  an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced .  the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death .  nowadays ,  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character .  the one we are witness of -the movie .   for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro´s mind ,  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done .  nevertheless ,  the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view ;  they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions ,  we clearly never justify them .  so ,  the first half is based upon recollecting information ;  later things turn into aro's childhood ,  giving the movie such an incredible new force  ( even tough never got weak or boring )  .   i don't mean -and don't want- to spoil anything ;  so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you ,  believe me ,  the trip to see it is more than worthy .
1	this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen .  the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre .  this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story .  the casts is outstanding ,  including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ,  ever .  the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one .  my one complaint ,  i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy ,  but other then that i think they did a great job .  the dialog ,  the characters and the story was perfect .  the acting was wonderful .  this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel .  you heard me ,  the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel .  i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10 .
1	without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed .  however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it .  it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance .  wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing ,  but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained .  mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line ,  the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster .  the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable .  she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be .  i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .
1	sure ,  titanic was a good movie ,  the first time you see it ,  but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change .  the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think :  ooh ,  how romantic .  the second time  ( and i am not the only one to think this )  it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking ,  when is this d**n ship going to sink ?  ?  ?  and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times .  the acting in this film is not bad ,  but definetly not great either .  was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film ,  i mean who does he think he is ,  anthony hopkins or denzel washington ?  he does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million .  and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it .  but enough about ,  in my eyes ,  the worst character of the film .  kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful .  i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together .  there is one lesson to be learned about this movie :  there are too many love-stories as it is ,  filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie !  !  !  out of a possible 100% i give this film a mere 71% .
1	just two comments .  .  .  . seven years apart ?  hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power !  as has been mentioned ,  the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal .  having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se .   true ,  the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror - only without much horror .  more a case of intrigue !  gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the  " house "  as the main suspect .  the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard .  it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments .   having picked the dvd up for a mere $3 . 95 last week at my regular video store ,  i cannot begrudge the expenditure .  $10 . 95 would be an acceptable price for the film .  just don't expect fireworks !
1	when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was .  this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating .  i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 .   the acting is superb .  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best .  i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate .    if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent ,  well ,  this is the one .  you will love all the acting ,  special effects ,  and much much more .   if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now !  !  !  you won't regret it .
1	why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather .  titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century . with great acting , directing , effects , music and generally everything .  this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree .  there is nothing wrong with this movie .  all i can say is that this movie ,  not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time ,  the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen .  apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time .  the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton .  these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic .
1	what's inexplicable ?  firstly ,  the hatred towards this movie .  it may not be the greatest movie of all time ,  but gimme a break ,  it got 11 oscars for a reason ,  it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason .  it's a damn good movie .  which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it .  i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters .  i've rewatched it on tv and video ,  and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen  ( twice ,  or maybe three times ,  actually )  .  but that might be it ,  the appeal of it .  it's a movie ,  yes ,  capital m there ,  it's an epic ,  it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur .  now ,  ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me ,  with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama .  not that titanic has none of that .  well ,  the acting was actually very good .  the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times .   but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride .  i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind ,  or give me a visual thrill .  this movie isn't exactly dumb ,  but it's not cerebral at all .  the visual thrills are simply means to an end ,  to fuel the emotions of the audience .  i didn't cry when bambi's mom died ,  i don't react to tearjerkers .  but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million ,  an emotional rollercoaster that ,  if it were a regular one ,  would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl .  and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it ,  and have a ready supply of cynicism ,  then you can thoroughly dislike this movie .  but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit ,  if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt ,  you'll enjoy it completely .  and look at the top ten grossing films of all time .  is a single one of them bad ?  is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 ?  no ,  not even the phantom menace .  and this movie made 1 . 8 billion dollars worldwide .  it can't be bad .  not possible .  10/10 .   p . s .  how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman ?  spiderman was a fun movie ,  but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did .  it simply wasn't anything all that special .  no one will remember it in 50 years .  but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered .
1	another aussie masterpiece ,  this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural ,  and it does very well .  it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks ,  it focuses more on emotional impact .  a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co .  bring to life .  it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside ,  and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago .  strange things begin to happen in the house ,  and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared ,  who was actually a mass murderer .  highly recommended .  8/10
1	previously ,  i wrote that i loved  " titanic "  ,  cried at its ending  ( many times over )  ,  and i'm a guy in his 60's .  i also wondered about why this great movie ,  which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics ,  was given only a 7 . 0 rating by imdb . com users .   well ,  i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings .  while 29 . 0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating ,  10 . 7% gave it a 1 rating .  these 10 . 7% of these irrational imdb users ,  in effect ,  pulled the overall rating down to 7 . 0 .    in my previous comments ,  i blamed this very unusual voting pattern  ( a sudden surge in 1 ratings ,  with a high 10 rating ,  dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level )  on only one thing :  hatred for leonardo dicaprio .  believe me ,  i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people  ( young men ,  mostly )  ,  who defame him left and right .  they absolutely hate the man ,  and they will have no part in giving him any credit in  " titanic "  .   ( to answer one other user :  i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much ,  and gave it a 5 or a 6 ,  etc .  everyone has ,  and is entitled to ,  his/her own taste .  but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 . 0 overall for  " titanic "  ,  pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings ,  is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture .  )   let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of  " titanic "  to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical  " bombs "   ( there are many more ,  but these 5 will prove my point )  .   " heaven's gate "   ( 1980 )  was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing ,  and imdb voters' ratings were :  23 . 2% 10 ratings and 9 . 2% 1 ratings  ( overall rating of 6 . 1 )  .   " big top pee-wee "   ( 1988 )  got 4 . 3% 10 ratings and 9 . 9% 1 ratings  ( overall rating of 4 . 5 )  .   " cat people "   ( 1982 )  got 6 . 1% 10 ratings and 2 . 6% 1 ratings  ( overall rating of 5 . 8 )  .   " blind date "   ( 1987 )  got 3 . 0% 10 ratings and 2 . 8% 1 ratings  ( overall rating of 5 . 3 )  .   " jumpin' jack flash "   ( 1986 )  got 4 . 4% 10 ratings and 3 . 7% 1 ratings  ( overall rating of 5 . 2 )  .  what do all of these films have in common with  " titanic "  ?  all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower  !  !  !  !  than  " titanic "  ,  and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award .  again ,   " titanic "  got 10 . 7% 1 ratings !  compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned .   can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor ?
1	i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day .  it was so touching and beautiful .  i strongly recommend seeing for all .  it's a movie to watch with your family by far .   my mpaa rating :  pg-13 for thematic elements ,  prolonged scenes of disastor ,  nudity/sexuality and some language .
1	the movie titanic makes it much more then just a  " night to remember .  "  it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten .  why so criticised ?  i have no idea .  could/will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it .  could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece .  it will be almost impossible .   the director no doubt had the major impact on the film .  a simple disaster film  ( boring to watch )  converted to an unbelievable romance .  yes i'm not the romance type either ,  but that should not bother you ,  because you will never see a romance like this .  guaranteed !  everything to the amazing effects ,  to the music ,  to the sublime acting .    the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling .  everything looks very real and live .  the legend herself  " titanic "  is shown brilliantly in all classes ,  too looks ,  too accommodation .  the acting was the real effect .  dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles .  no one could have done better .  they are partly the reason why the film is so great .    i guess it's not too much to talk about .  the plot is simple ,  the acting is brilliant ,  based on a true story ,  probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears ,  thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten .  well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical ,  and a film to idolise for hollywood .  could it get better ?  no .  not at all .  the most moving film of all time ,  don't listen to people ,  see for yourself then you will understand .  a landmark .   ( don't be surprised if you cry too )
1	i had few problems with this film ,  and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated .  true ,  it is over three hours long ,  but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly .  i don't think it is overrated at all ,  i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent .  the film looks sumptuous ,  with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects ,  and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus .  leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack ,  and kate winslet is lovely as rose .  david warner ,  a great actor ,  steals every scene he's in .  the story is very rich in detail ,  and is hot on character development ,  obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be ,  though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow .  the last hour is extremely riveting ,  and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat ,  when the titanic sank .  i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving .  the music score by james horner was lovely ,  though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on .  the 1996 miniseries was good ,  but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies .  overall ,  i give titanic an 8 . 5/10 .  bethany cox .
1	i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies .  anyway ,  everyone remembers the rms titanic .  it was big ,  fast ,  and  " unsinkable "  .  .  .  until april 1912 .  it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever .  well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship .  well ,  onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film .   so our two main characters are jack  ( leonardo dicaprio )  and rose  ( kate winslet )  .  they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying  (  http : //tinyurl . com/ojhoyn  )  .  the main villain i guess is bad luck ,  fate ,  hand of god  ( no blasphemy intended )  ,  or just plain caledon hockley  ( billy zane )  .  combine all of the above and what do you get ?  !  oh yes !  we get a love story on a sinking boat .  the supporting characters are the following :  my personal favorite ,  mr .  andrews  ( victor garber )  ( idk he was so nice )  ,  lovejoy ( david warner )  ,  murdoch ( ewan stewart )  ,  lightoller  ( jonathan phillips )  ,  captain smith ( bernard hill )  ,  molly brown ( kathy bates )  ,  and many more .  we also got the present day treasure hunter ,  brock lovett  ( bill paxton )  .  they add something to the story ,  something good .  the action in here is awesome ,  especially in the second half ,  the drama as also good .  in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears .  the story is simple and it works .  a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond .  she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic .  two lovers separated by social class and ultimately ,  the fate of the ship .  everything about the story works and there are very few flaws .  i give titanic ,  an 86% awesome
1	titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship .  writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 ,  1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic .  the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet .  they make for a good on-screen couple .  dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable .  they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well .  the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane ,  kathy bates ,  frances fisher ,  jonathan hyde ,  and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film .  the love story ,  the action ,  suspense ,  and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time .  the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation .  the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws .  titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it .  the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg .  overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch .
1	the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't !  !  !  director ,  james cameron ,  from 'the terminator' did it again with this amazing picture .  one of my favorite scenes is 'the dinner table' scene ,  in which rose's family and friends meet jack after he saves her .  rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the one' .  .  . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .   jack and rose have a connection that is 'movie stuff' but it's good movie stuff .  we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth .  rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her .  i really liked the hanging over the boat scene .  it was a good risk .   the movie is long but it's fantastic !  !  !  good story ,  good flow ,  good actors !  !  !  go see it twice if you want ,  its worth it !  !  !
1	titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies .  it has its problems  ( what movies don't )  but still ,  it's enjoyable .   when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic ,  i suppose my first reaction is  " wait a minute ,  you don't ?  "  i know so many people who don't like this movie ,  and i'm not saying i don't see why .   " the love story is too cheesy "  well ,  yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving ?  all right ,  the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic ,  everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist .  but this is a movie ,  doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while ?  the next complaint ,  dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors .  well ,  ok ,  in this movie ,  i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials .  however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors .  i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in .  but the roles they are given are simple ,  and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit ,  but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected .   and finally ,  if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance ,  or because they hate history ,  or tragic movies ,  then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things .  it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies .  simply for being a movie ,  not because you dislike the genre ,  this is a good movie .   well deserving of its oscars ,  in particular ,  best cinematography ,  which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy .   i know some of the writing fails ,  such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie .  the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times ,  but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real ,  and the sinking feel so epic .   i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie ,  but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea ,  such as it being a love story ,  rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed .   i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic ,  including memoirs form the day it happened ,  and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults .  the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper ,  not steel ,  and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it .   i give this movie 10/10 ,  not because i like romance movies ,  but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement ,  that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events .
1	titanic is a classic .  i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten ,  overall in the imdb user rankings .  maybe ,  it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays ,  but when it was first made it was really something .  when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters .  when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month .  it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason .  some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot ,  like the frozen baby ,  or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd .  many people died on that ship ,  and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to .  and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose .  whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely .  they barely knew each other ,  but they would die for each other .  they trusted each other .  they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money .   " i'll never let go ,  jack .  "  titanic is a great film down to it's very core .  it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting ,  excellent cinematography ,  beautiful music ,  and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers .  it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .
1	for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time .  no exceptions .  james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller .  through films such as aliens ,  the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes .  he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film .  but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance .  the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises ,  plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows .  the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful ,  interesting and entertaining film about it .  the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose  ( gloria stuart )  tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone ,  no one else .  emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home .  the music has become iconic and legendary .  it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience .  the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is .  only one problem ,  the usual james cameron problem ,  is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside .  james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime .  my heart won't go on from this one .
1	back in 1997 ,  do i remember that year :  clinton bans cloning research ,  the unfortunate death of princess diana ,  the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets .  this was also the big year in the release of titanic ,  one of the biggest films of all time :  a tale about the ship of dreams ,  about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster .  i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was ,  the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans ,  85% of them being teenage girls ,  i was 12 years old at the time ,  and of course saw the movie multiple times .  it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful .  at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong ,  of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14 ,  a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5 . 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now .  was it worth the hype ?  was it really the best movie of all time ?  was that leonardo's real nose ?  ok ,  i know that's silly to say ,  but i did re-watch the film .  being completely honest here ,  titanic is a great movie ,  best movie of all time ,  no ,  just depends on your idea of a good movie ,  but titanic delivered in romance ,  humor ,  disaster ,  emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage .   the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic ,  searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean .  unsuccessful ,  they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude ,  wearing the heart of the ocean ,  dated the day the titanic sank .  101-year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing ,  and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing .  she and her granddaughter elizabeth  " lizzy "  calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship .  when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace ,  rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic ,  revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater .  in 1912 ,  the upper-class 17-year-old rose boards the ship with her fiancé ,  cal hockley and her mother ,  ruth dewitt bukater ,  both of whom stress the importance of rose's engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts :  while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class ,  rose and her mother are financially broke .  distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage ,  rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern .  before she leaps ,  a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes .  jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life ,  and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching ;  their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance ,  music and beer in third-class .  but after cal's servant informs him of rose's whereabouts' ,  rose is forbidden from seeing jack again .  however ,  after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a  " proper lady "  at tea ,  rose defies him and her mother ,  asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean ,  an engagement present from cal .  after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time ,  they go to the deck of the ship .   they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg .  after overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is ,  rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal .  meanwhile ,  cal discovers rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe ,  so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack's pocket .  upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck ,  rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him .  jack and rose return to the top deck .  cal and jack ,  though enemies ,  both want rose safe ,  so they persuade her to board a lifeboat .  but after realizing that she cannot leave jack ,  rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship's first class staircase .  jack and rose return to the top deck ,  the lifeboats have gone ,  and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down .   so does titanic live up to it's hype ?  i still say that this is a great movie to watch ,  i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie .  but it has great acting ,  amazing effects ,  a well-written story and still looks flawless .  love it or hate it ,  you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight ,  this film is something special .  it will always hold a special place in my heart ,  it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released .  but all that aside ,  i do recommend this movie ,  it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day .   10/10

1	this movie re-wrote film history in every way .  no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie ,  because it transcends criticism .  every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it .  it is an extremely beautiful movie ,  and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again .  i've seen it more times than i care to count ,  and i still become transfixed every time ,  with a feeling which is hard to describe .  one for the ages .
1	titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic .  the plot is simple ,  noncomplicated ,  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense .  the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film ,  but the love story is an interesting one ,  however .  kate winslett is wonderful as rose ,  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  ( billy zane )  .  early on the voyage rose meets jack  ( leonardo dicaprio )  ,  a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game .  if he wants something ,  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries .  the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes .   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures ,  that sunk with the titanic ,  which has recently occurred .  one of the survivors of the titanic ,  rose dewitt bukater ,  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search .  she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic .  with this ,  the scene shifts to southhampton ,  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 ,  1912 as all the passengers are boarding .  after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york .  historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful ,  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger ,  jack dawson .  captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned .  smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed .  the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs ,  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie .  on april 15 ,  1912 at 11 : 39 ,  an iceberg was sighted .  they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film .  the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate .  the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2 : 18 when the lights finally failed .  the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help .  the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own .  the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship .  overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too .  the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking .  also ,  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold ,  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle .  overall ,  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic .   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship .  the core group of rose ,  jack ,  cal ,  and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time .  yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown ;  captain edward smith ;  the ship designer ,  thomas andrew ;  the white star line representative ,  bruce ismay ;  and all of the titanic's officers were real .  the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards .  he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk .  the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol .  he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown .  as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations .  in addition ,  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted .  the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss' .  not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs .  strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic .  furthermore ,  mr .  goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best .  the richest man on the ship ,  john jacob astor ,  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well ,  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat .  in addition ,  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water .  her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke .  all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware .  the gymnasium ,  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs .  the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of 1912 .  the rich at this time practically ruled everything ,  as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet .  women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do .  the rich did not take well to `new money' such as molly brown as depicted .  everything of the time was very formal .  women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes .  smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes ,  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie .  men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes .  women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society .  although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken .  the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking .   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise .  the director ,  james cameron ,  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives .  everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night .  in addition ,  this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic .  only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored .  this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed .  however ,  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed .  there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed .  as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter .   technically the film is very well done .  to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie .  in addition ,  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean .  cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship .  furthermore ,  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage .  this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner .  at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film .   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art ,  a true epic .  like most history novels ,  we know the ending ,  but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture .  certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming ,  sound ,  cintematography ,  and editing .  if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster ,  then this movie definitely is for you .
1	i find it so amazing that even after all these years ,  we are still talking about this movie !  obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it .  i personally enjoyed this film immensly ,  and still do !  i guess this film isn't for everyone ,  but it certainly did touch the hearts of many .    as for those that think that this film is  " overrated "  or  " over-hyped "  .  .  . well ,  we only have the movie-going public to thank for that !  lol* you see ,  it's not critics/article writers that make a film  " huge "  or a  " hit "  with the general movie-going public .  people make the film a huge success .  with titanic ,  everyone was in awe .  let's face it ,  a film like this had never been made before .  at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking .  this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 .  even the silverware for goodness sakes matched !    give this movie a break you guys !  the critics thought this movie would sink big time !  when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth  ( which is the best form of advertisement mind you )  that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing ,  then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie .  .  . not once ,  not twice ,  but maybe 3 times and more !  so ,  i really wouldn't say that this movie was  " overhyped "  .  .  . at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being  " overhyped "  .  ha !  critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film .  however ,  the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more !    personally ,  i love this film .  however ,  this film might not be for everyone .  don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though !  that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard !  disliking a movie just because it has romance in it !  the story was sweet .  the dialogue could have been better ,  but let's face it .  .  . the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate .  .  . it was that gigantic ship !  i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job .  it's not thier best work  ( i've seen much better work from both of them )  but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before .  give them a break !
1	i avoided watching this film for the longest time .  long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped ,  over-blown ,  overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz ,  and i wanted nothing to do with it .  i never watched it in the theatre .  i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it .  then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest .  one of the girls spoke about this movie .   " it was so great ,  "  she said .   " you really felt like you were on the ship .  "   " nonsense ,  "  i thought .  i shared my feelings with my fellow judges .  one looked at me and said ,   " you might be right ,  but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic .  the movie must have done something right to get her so interested .  "   " well ,  maybe ,  "  thought i .  then it finally appeared on pay tv .   " ok ,  "  i thought ,   " i'll give it a look see .  "  i didn't want to like it - and i didn't .  i loved it !  what a great movie .   where to start ?  first - the directing .  my high school public speaking contestant was right .  james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost  " you are there "  type of atmosphere .  the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world .  the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads ;  then the rising sense of panic .  you don't just watch it ;  you really do feel it .  then - the performances .  the lead performances from kate winslet  ( as rose )  and leonardo dicaprio  ( as jack )  are excellent - winslet's being the superior ,  i thought ,  but both were good .  they had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect  " t "  i thought .  in my opinion ,  though ,  stealing the show was frances fisher as rose's mother .  she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat ,  and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack .  then - the details .  i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic ,  but i have a reasonable general knowledge ,  and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance .  very impressive ,  indeed .  then - the song .  who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion's performance of  " my heart goes on .  "   problems .  well ,  the romance was perhaps too contrived ,  in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class .   ( i know he was invited the first time ;  but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while .  )  the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed ,  i thought ,  when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats .    a minor quibble ,  though .  this is truly an excellent movie .  my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre ,  where i think it would have been so much more impressive .   9/10
1	to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue ,  the budget ,  the this and the that .  .  .  . who wants to hear it ?  if you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie ,  that's your loss .  the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think .  i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life ,  and this one stands in its own entity ,  in my book .  it was not supposed to be a documentary ,  or a completely factual account of what happened that night .  it is the most amazing love story ever attempted .  i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy ,  but come on .  someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money !  how lame is that ?  it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet ,  and is the top grossing film in the planet .  i will gladly side with the majority this time around .  okay ,  cynics ,  time to crawl back under your rock ,  i am done .
1	after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted ,  urban ,  turn of the century australian street ,  we meet julie  ( rebecca gibney )  and peter  ( john adam )  as they go out house hunting .  they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street ,  but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home .  it just may be haunted .   13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker .   the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget ,  but not wholly excusable to that hurdle .  a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film .  the opening  " thriller scene "  features some wonky editing .  freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action .  suspense should be created from staging ,  not fancy  " fix it in the mix "  techniques .  there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location ,  the lighting ,  the fog and such ,  but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim ,  cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street ,  showing their increasing proximity .  the tracking and the cuts need to be slow .  the attack needed to be longer ,  clearer and better blocked .  as it stands ,  the scene has a strong  " made for television "  feel ,  and a low budget one at that .   after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves .  the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror  ( 1979 )  ,  though the budget forces a much subtler approach .  millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios ,  often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented ,  such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron ,  which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall .   for some horror fans ,  the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama .  at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in .  but morphett writes fine ,  intelligent dialogue .  the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house .   once they get settled and things begin to get weirder ,  even though the special effects often leave much to be desired ,  the ideas are good .  the performances help create tension .  there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares .  but neither menace is really the point .   the point is human relationships .  there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting .  the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it .  that it's in a posh neighborhood ,  and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies ,  shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe ,  such as money or health problems .  peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with  " normal "  work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive ,  scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful .  at the same time ,  we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be .  julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown ,  but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship .   although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness ,  as a tv movie ,  this is a pretty good one ,  with admirable ambitions .  anyone fond of haunted house films ,  psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy .  it certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a dvd  ( that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it  ( factoring in shipping and handling )  )  ,  but it's worth a rental ,  and it's definitely worth watching for free .

"  i'll mention titanic ,  and at least a couple people will snicker .  i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago ,  these same people were moved to tears by that very movie .  and they're too embarrassed now to admit it .   i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time .  expecting to simply enjoy the story again ,  i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years .  i cried again .  .  .  .  in all the same places .  it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time .  a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall  ( yes ,  even more than star wars )  .  and today ,  many people won't even admit they enjoyed it .  folks ,  let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film .  you look like an out of touch cynic .   no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults .  some of the dialogue falls flat ,  and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly .  however ,  none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film .   leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful .  leo is one of the fine actors of his generation .  wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy .  kate winslet was so strong in this film .  the movie really was hers ,  and she held it together beautifully .   james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic .  the sinking scenes were horrific ,  just as they were that night .  how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me .  i was utterly transfixed .   this film is one memorable scene after another .  titanic leaving port in southampton .  rose and jack at the bow ,   " flying "  .   " iceberg ,  right ahead !  "  the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean .  the screams of the doomed after she went down .  and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears .   the music ,  which has also been a victim of the film's success ,  was a key ingredient .  james horner's score was simply perfect .  and the love theme was beautiful and tragic .  too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many .   i confess ,  i am a titanic buff .  as such ,  i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty .  perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life .  however ,  i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs .  i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy .  the film was made with such humanity .   another reviewer said it better than i ever could :  open up your hearts to titanic ,  and you will not be disappointed .
1	i am not a parent ,  neither am i a male .  but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains .   this is a movie teenagers should watch .  maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again .  i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love ,  family and friendship .   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing .  and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance .  he showed at an early age ,  that he is capable of heartfelt drama .  he should be offered more serious roles .  note hollywoodland .  .  .  his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 .   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages .  maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families ,  but i recommend it to the entire family .   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times .  because it portrays the values that are important in life .
1	daniell steel's daddy ,  what a refreshing story .  this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children .  how rare is that ?  in these times of  " heather has two mommies "   ( or what ever ,  you fill in the blanks )  it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone .  with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga .  how disappointing to have it end .  every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role .  i would have loved to see each character develop over the years .  i loved this movie ,  it is one i will defiantly watch every time it's on .  good story ,  good acting ,  and i hope this isn't a spoiler ,  but no obtrusive sex or bad language .  yes it touched my heart .  warning ,  get the kleenex ready .  what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment ,  be it television or .  movie's .  daniell if your listening ,  you go girl ,  give us more .
1	verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage .  he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed .  by his own admission ,  he read 2 chapters of the book ,  got bored ,  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch .   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it .  it basically steals the name ,  mocks politics of the book  ( which is a good portion of it )  ,  and throws in some t&a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored .   this anime isn't perfect ,  but it's at least mostly accurate ,  as best i can tell .
1	family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about .  love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about .  one man ,  daddy ,  has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity .  the kids grow up , one all be it ,  in the hard way ,  to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is ,  the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall .  all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances .  yes ,  i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent .  this true to life is one which every young adult ,  and parent ,  would do well to see ,  although some will not realize it until they too are parents .  a must see for those who care about their families .
1	it's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males .  in this one the wife/mother leaves her family to  " get in touch "  with herself - or pursue her libido .  the father stays with and nurtures the kids ,  letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them .
1	i must admit ,  when i read the description of the genre on netflix as  " steamy romance "  i was a little bit skeptical .   " steamy "  ?  in a movie from 1968 ?  ?  i was prepared for disappointment .  and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white ,  i knew my erotic hopes were dashed .   boy ,  was i wrong !  not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love ,  fear of the secret being found out ,  a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic .  you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white .  the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years .  and the performances from the two stars  ( essy persson and anna gael )  are intense and memorable .  ok ,  so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls .  it's 1968 .  do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this ?  many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then .  anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much .   i think this movie was way ahead of its time .  the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure ;  yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination ,  opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown .   i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here .  as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action :  although it won't be all you expect ,  i don't think you'll be too ,  too disappointed .
1	this is a film .  .  ,  not porn .   this is a wonderful film !  !  !  full of tender moments and memories !  !  a beautiful piece of work !  !  !  excellent !  !  !  for intelligent ,  viewers only !  !  !   if you are a film lover .  a romantic .  a person who has loved deeply ,  this is your film !  !  !  !   it has a beautiful surreal quality .  fine acting and directing .  watching this film made me remember my first love .   thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life ,  love and the meaning of loss .   highly recommended for all film lovers .
1	it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today's standards ,  the film is interesting and provocative   therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl's school therese is energetic ,  intelligent ,  and becomes a mentor for the innocent ,  naive ,  sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences ,  including a trip through an exclusive brothel ,  into her first lesbian liaison ,  and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience   the film does not exploit any sex ,  nor is there an abundance of nudity .  .  .  the imagery is effective ,  but sometimes the camera lingers too long ,  and the story goes slowly   the director ,  radley metzger ,  went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories ,  good acting ,  and very high standards of cinematography .  .  .   artistically ,  however ,  this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment ,  whereas  " therese and isabelle "  was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism .  .  .
1	we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies ,  and i absolutely loved this movie .  i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch .  the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone .  i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed .  this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating .  this is a movie i will show to my children .  the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women ,  but this movie was more than that .  it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite .
1	i was going to bed with my gf last night ,  and while she was brushing her teeth ,  i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks .  at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie ,  so i started watching it ,  and then it immediately captured me in ,  and i had to finish it .   the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble .  she was such a great actor for being so little .  maybe the fact it was in chinese ,  so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell .  .  . but she really seemed to be in character perfectly .  i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her  " boss "  but everything just turned out rotten .  lol .  even when she brings him another grandson ,  just so he can pass on his art .  .  . it turns out that kid was kidnapped ,  so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live .  lol .  .  . whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa ,  just backfires .   in the end ,  he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks .  .  . which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie .   definitely a gem ,  and totally original .   scott
1	i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian .  i've seen enough of them  baby boom ,  kolya ,  about a boy ,  mostly martha ,  and to some extent ,  whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula .  what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting :  small-town china in the 1930's .  extreme poverty was the norm ,  and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market .  when wang discovers his purchased grandson ,  whom he's nicknamed  " doggie ,  "  is a granddaughter ,  he initially casts her out ,  even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir .  even after he reluctantly takes her back ,  he's not too upset when she's kidnapped .  the film is gritty then ,  showing the lengths to which a young ,  street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society .   the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context .  in a western society ,  one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success .  wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status ,  though ,  that i did ,  too .  while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern ,  suburban child ,  it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage .  and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her ,  her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense .   the peek at small-town life in a foreign country ,  the naturalness of the two lead actors ,  the surprising plot twists ,  and of course ,  the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .
1	this movie is the best film ever .  i can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me .  with a tear in my eye ,  i admire this movie .  it has all the elements that a good movie must have :  excellent dialogues ,  music ,  acting ,  story/plot .  a story of friendship ,  courage ,  kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar .  little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson .  they were not conventional in real .  every scene they were together was priceless .  the camera work is flawless and grips you .  the acting is inspired .  xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks .  renying zhou  " doggie "  looks pretty and played her character very well .  zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great .  he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well .  if you have't this movie ,  try it once ,  do watch it .
1	wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a 'king of masks' for his mastery of sichuan change art .  liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person .  liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang's mind .  the film is about prejudices ,  male domination ,  state of art ,  values and most importantly warmth .   i can't recommend this film enough .  the whole film is in loops .  everything has a significance .  its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes .  a total satisfaction .  for five minutes it is an artistic film ,  next five minutes its a sad film ,  next five minutes its a thriller .  it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face .  last scene on the rope is phenomenal .  story and script is flawless .  actors are brilliant .  both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed .  very impressive .  it was not even nominated for oscars .  that year 'english patient' got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category 'kolya' won .  'kolya' was just ok and about 'english patient' the lesser said the better .  watch it 9/10 .
1	one of the most heart-warming foreign films i've ever seen .   the young girl is an amazing talent .  stellar performances by her  ( doggie )  ,  the old man  ( the king of masks )  ,  and liang  ( the living boddhisatva )  .    ( spoiler )  the deplorable treatment of children ,  especially females is disturbing .   loved the music .  the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story .   this is a must see -- enjoyable family film ,  although not for very young children .  would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .
1	wow .  what a wonderful film .  the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei , i hope he has more stories in him .   the acting is sublime .  renying zhou as doggie was amazing -- very natural talent ,  and xu zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist .    the soundtrack was very effective ,  guiding without being overwhelming .    if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong- a family friendly ,  well acted ,  well written ,  well directed ,  near perfect gem .
1	the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic .  i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - i felt i could get a real sense of the times ,  recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living .  it seemed worthwhile to experience .  the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect ,  perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film .  casting is great .  images are memorable .  acting is solid enough .  thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression .
1	the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship .  set in 1930s china during a time of floods ,  we meet wang ,  an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him .  when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang ,  he invites wang to join their troupe .  however ,  we learn that wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son .  learning that wang is childless ,  wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever .  taking the advice to heart ,  wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy ;  he would teach his new son ,  doggie ,  the ancient art of silk masks .  soon ,  wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art .   together ,  wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it .  the story is absorbing .  the setting is serene and the costuming simple .  summarily ,  it is an international award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire .
1	this is a superb movie ,  suitable for all but the very youngest ,  though accessibility for younger people was marred  ( at least in the print which i saw )  by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub-titling !  for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown ,  not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle ,  just a drab ,  almost monochrome ,  everyday life ,  against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks .  even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war ,  this could still be any time in the past 150 years .   but then we briefly see a motor car - late 30s ,  early 40s style - and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals ,  and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution .   which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant .   but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today ,  both within china and in other parts of the world :  the inequality between boys and girls ,  men and women ;  the trade ,  for various purposes ,  in young children ;  corruption in society ;  injustice ;  the importance of friendship .   maybe i'm reading too much into this film ;  but i don't think so !  i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom ,  whilst dross is passed off as quality material .   but don't get me started on that .  .  .
1	king of masks  ( bian lian in china )  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film .  winner of 16 awards from around the world ,  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian ,  a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera .  he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance ,  and no one knows how he does it .  he has a longing desire to have a grandson ,  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir .  we then go to the streets ,  and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them :  some are even begging to take their daughters for free ,  because daughters are not worth much in this society .  wang bianlian's story goes on from there .   the film was so astonishingly good ,  the acting was amazing ,  and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed .  there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place ,  no one wants a little girl .  also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman ,  and while he is famous and well-respected ,  he regards himself as something low ,  a half woman .  as we go further into the film ,  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it ,  the brutality and corruption of the military and police ,  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions .   this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life ,  and xu zhu ,  the actor who plays wang bianlian ,  presents yet another beautiful performance .
1	this is how movies are supposed to be made :  a fascinating setting ;  characters about whom you come to care deeply ;  writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense .  this is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental .  highly recommended .
1	this movie was excellent .  a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes .  this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie .  you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way ,  doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions .  this equals on big happy movie in the end .  this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be ,  so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets .  you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture .  the cinema-photography is excellent ,  in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers .  bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film .
1	robert a .  heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years ,  in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series ,  to a number of games .  but none of these ,  so to speak ,  has really captured the spirit of his novel .  the games are usually unrelated ,  the tv series was more of a spin off ,  and the less said about verhoeven's film ,  the better .  little do most know ,  however ,  that in japan ,  an animated adaptation had already been done ,  released the year of heinlein's death .  and ,  believe it or not ,  despite its differences ,  this 6-part animated series is ,  plot-wise ,  the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic .   the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons ,  something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film .  like the book ,  the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel ,  though we see a fair amount of each .  while events happen differently than in the book ,  the feel of the book's plot is present .  rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement ,  but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book .  while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book  ( it gets a bit of the anime treatment ,  but what did you expect ?  )  ,  but it's far superior to the film .  heinlein's political views are merely excised ,  as opposed to the film ,  where they are reversed .  the big payoff of the series ,  however ,  is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens ,  which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version .   overall ,  i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein .  and i think they did pretty well with this .  if you can find this series ,  give it a look .
1	this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone ,  but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation .  women and performers  ( both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star )  are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china .  this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture .   the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance .   a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .
1	as i was watching this film on video last night ,  i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure .  i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to come .   it's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film .  and even though some cultural references are obscure for me ,  a western viewer ,  at the core this is a universal tale .
1	ok ,  let's get this clear .  i'm really not into sci-fi ,  but for some reason i love stargate sg-1 .    jack o'neil takes his team sg-1 through a stargate .  a round device that creates a wormhole .  it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds .  it might sound like your usual sci-fi-series ,  but it's not !  the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series .  i find that great .  it gives you things ,  happenings and such you can relate to ,  and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets .  they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology ,  there's not many .    the series has a nice blending of action ,  humor and drama .  if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here .  they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .
1	when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir ,  the aging and very proud street performer ,  known to all as  " the king of masks ,  "  becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate .   his warmth and humanity ,  tho ,  find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china's devastating natural disasters ,  in this case ,  massive flooding in the 1930's .   he takes his new ,  7 year old companion ,  onto his straw houseboat ,  to live with his prized and beautiful monkey ,   " general ,  "  only to discover that the he-child is a she-child .   his life is instantly transformed ,  as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man .   there are many stories inside this one .  .  . many people are touched ,  and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe .  thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama ,  and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye .   the technical transfer itself is not that great ,  as i found the sound levels all over the meter ,  and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie .  highly recommended  : - )  9/10 stars .
1	an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film .   shameful since it warrants having a wider audience .   a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told ,  although admittedly predictable in its resolution .  solidly acted by the principals .  beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film .   my recent foray into chinese film  ( shower ,  the road home ,  not one less )  has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring .  china and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers .   " the king of masks "  can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film .
1	one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find ,  if you are lucky ,  in the video stores ,  is they are very accurate retellings of actual ,  true stories .  farewell ,  my concubine ,  the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples .  the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much hollywood ,  and especially disney films .   in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art .  along an having lost his only son many years earlier ,  he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work .  master wang is sold a son by a slave trader .  all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art .  but the son eventually is found out to be a girl .  from there ,  the story get very interesting ,  with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera -- a regional operatic style related to peking opera .  fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera .  it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati ,  but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality .
1	quote by nicolas martin  ( nicmart )  from houston ,  tx :   " fine film ,  but dvd  " reformatted for tv "  ,  8 april 2002 - this is a charming and emotive film .  on the other hand ,  the dvd i purchased has been  " reformatted to fit your tv "  by the clods at columbia tristar .  there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format ,  except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic ,  disposable trash that it is so used to producing .  what a shame .  "   what a  ( criminal !  )  shame indeed .  however ,  there is another version out though .  see here for details http : //www . dvdbeaver . com/film/dvdcompare2/kingofmasks . htm  wonderful performances by the two main actors  ( the king and doggie )  btw .
1	" masks "  is a moving film that works on many levels .  at its simplest ,  it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art  ( masks )  to the next generation .  although ,  at times the story makes the old man into a job ,  it is so well crafted  ( written ,  acted ,  directed ,  wonderful production values )  ,  it is easy to move beyond his plight .  and ,  if you hang with it ,  the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting .  kudos all around .  this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults .  the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it !
1	beautiful and touching movie .  rich colors ,  great settings ,  good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while .  i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china .  my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .
1	this is probably my favorite movie of all time .  it is perfection in its storytelling .  it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through .  you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time .
1	it's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really ,  given the right circumstances .  street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing .  the aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to .  from there ,  we follow them through the rigors of their challenging ,  but free life along the river .  traveling town to town ,  he performs and has some degree of notoriety .  despite the times and the influences ,  the man is kind and good .   overall ,  the performances are first rate ,  especially xu zhu ,  who portrays the street performer .  the child  ( renying zhou )  is beautiful ,  and downright strong ,  and withstands the overt prejudices well .  the two protagonists ,  along with supporting help from the kind opera singer ,  master liang  ( an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang )  ,  paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness ,  sadness and love .  some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to ba wang bie ji  ( farewell my concubine )  ;  yet this film can't stand easily on its own ,  any resemblance is remote at best .   my only qualm with the king of masks ,  is the ending .  it was weak ,  cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer .  the audience was already wrapped up in the story ,  what was the needless manipulation for ?  what a shame .  to bring a fine motion picture that far ,  only to surrender to emotional  ( and corny )  pathos like that .  it frankly made this film good ,  instead of the classic ,  it should've been .  that aside ,  the king of masks is still very well worth your time .  i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films .  highly recommended .
1	i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film .  the story is simple .  an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children .  the faces of the actors are marvelous to see .  the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well .  the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine ,  which was more sophisticated and intricate .  the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel .  the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism ,  humanity ,  and history portrayed .
1	scott bartlett's 'offon' is nine minutes of pure craziness .  it is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic ,  pulsating ,  epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours ,  and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema .  there's no story to speak of ,  but bartlett uses images of nature  particularly the human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions ,  integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology .  in a sense ,  the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools ,  his machinery ,  his technology .  this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's '2001 :  a space odyssey  ( 1968 )  , ' and ,  indeed ,  bartlett's opening sequence of images  flashing colours before a close-up human eye  recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate .  the visuals are richly-coloured ,  a confronting blend of sharp ,  vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video ,  as though we're sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact ,  the end product was recorded from a tv monitor} .   there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date .  imdb lists the film as a 1972 release ,  but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year .  perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening .  either way ,  the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time ,  occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video ,  and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss ,  either !  'offon' captures grainy ,  fragmented images ,  presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information .  i had a thought  and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation  that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed ,  alien documentation of human life ,  a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense .  perhaps this is where mankind ,  with all his technology ,  is eventually heading ,  towards an irreversible merging of film and video ,  of purity and artificiality .
1	in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china ,  there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture ,  partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth ,  and more importantly ,  due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era .   however ,  the resurgence of chinese traditional culture ,  namely ,  the confucianism ,  was not without disasters ,  because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part ,  and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example .   moreover ,  not only the part that should be discarded were inherited ,  the good part that was supposed to be inherited ,  such as the traditional opera ,  and its technique ,  such as changing face ,  was ignored in the resurgence ,  and facing extinction .   the director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .
1	i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 .  it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons .  sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more .  atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons .  and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead .  this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it  !  !  !  !  !  10/10
1	this is a beautiful ,  rich ,  and very well-executed film with a rich and meaningful story .  basically ,  it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a  ( male )  heir to carry on his craft ,  but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male-dominated world .  the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions .   the story is fun ,  emotional ,  and complex .  the exploration of the characters ,  their lives ,  and emotions ,  is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all .  the film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir ,  and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation .  there is also humour ,  sometimes quite subtle ,  at appropriate points .  the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture ,  creating further interest and depth to the film .   the directing ,  acting ,  and scenery are all outstanding .  added to the other strengths ,  this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling ,  real characters .  as a result ,  the film evokes strong empathy for ,  and feelings about ,  the characters .   some have claimed that the ending weakens the film ,  but i do not necessarily agree .  perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending ,  but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small .
1	the movie is truly poignant ,  unique and uplifting .  the story is universal in that it's a battle between good ,  evil and the world between .  the most important thing is that its rating is wrong ,  misleading ,  and a travesty .  blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie .  the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles .
1	the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted-to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists .  .  .  .  .  . and rightly so .  this deserves a lot better treatment .   the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft  ( the rules of the day )  and winds up with a little girl instead  ( not the conventional way )   .  .  .  . and the problems that ensue afterward .  the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy ,  which he obviously thought was the case .   the old man  " bianlian wang  ( xu zhu ) is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin .  the little girl  " doggie "   ( zhou renying )  is a cutie .  the rest of the story is how the two manage after that .  i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes .   overall ,  it's involving story complete with drama ,  suspense ,  humor and sadness .  just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd .  until it comes out on widescreen ,  rent it .
1	this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen .  it shows a china i had never seen or imagined ,  and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie .  it is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations ,  seeing how hard life was for the characters ,  and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful .  you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film .  the actors are all perfect ,  such that you feel like you have really entered a different world .    i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough .  it may just change you forever once you have seen it .
1	i just saw this movie today with my children  ( son ,  10 and daughter ,  4 . 5 )  at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival .  after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director ,  tian-ming wu .  he  ( through a translator )  told several stories about his life and the making of the film .   all tangents aside ,  both of my children really enjoyed this movie .  of course ,  i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter ,  but much of the film is visually self-explanatory .   i won't give anything away ,  but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95% of the hollywood crap  ( especially children's films )  out there .   cheers .   p . s .  there is a  " real " /original king of masks who can/could do 12 masks at once .  the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time  ( then they would cut and change to 4 new masks )  .
1	this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows .  it's full of cliches ,  and the liz taylor character is not believable .  it has a marvelous set ,  some exotic location footage .  it shows taylor at the height of her beauty .  she looks stunning .
1	fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest !   the sfx are very good for a movie of its age ,  and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors ,  even down to body type ,  a rarity in movies of this vintage .   a cozy movie ,  with splendid panoramas -- even when chopped down to pan and scan .
1	elephant walk  ( 1954 )  starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen ,  staying out in the midday sun and going berserk .  well eventually they do ,  after the typhoid or cholera outbreak ,  of course ,  and much mayhem ensues .  taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler/adventure flick .  when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps .  thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day .  one of my favorite guilty pleasures .  in color too !
1	.   .   .  or type on a computer keyboard ,  they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of  " 10 .  "  after all ,  no elephants are shown being killed during the movie ;  it is not even implied that any are hurt .  to the contrary ,  the master of elephant walk ,  john wiley  ( peter finch )  ,  complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government  ( and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability )  .  furthermore ,  the elements conspire--in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic--to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people  ( as the natives dub them )  to close the story .  if you happen to see the current release earth ,  you'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today .
1	i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue ,  but was pleased to find a fast-paced script ,  an underlying moral ,  excellent portrayals from all the actors ,  especially peter finch ,  amazing special effects ,  suspense ,  and beautiful cinematography--there's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban .  not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic ,  before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work .  all the supporting players round it out ,  and i do wonder who trained all those elephants .   speaking of the stone-buddha sequence ,  you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots .  her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's .  the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots ,  where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk .   if you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring ,  spend a few hours with elephant walk .
1	i watched  " elephant walk "  for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior  " rebecca .  "  as others have said ,  you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor ,  only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger-than-life yet deeply flawed relative .  you have the stern and disapproving servant ,  a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart ,  climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead .   meanwhile ,   " elephant walk "  also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to  " the letter ,  "  the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation .   maltin gives  " elephant walk "  just two stars ,  and imdb readers aren't much kinder ,  but i enjoyed it despite its predictability .  elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier ,  and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father .  dana andrews -- a favorite in  " laura "  and  " the best year of our lives "  -- is wasted as elizabeth's frustrated admirer .  the real star is the bungalow ,  one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history .
1	the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon  ( current day sri lanka )  .  upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd .  william dieterle ,  who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie  ,  does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark ,  and almost eerie ,  undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery .
1	a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon .  although based upon the book by robert standish ,  this initial set-up is highly reminiscent of hitchock's  " rebecca "  ,  with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and  ( almost immediately )  her own husband ,  who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father .  taylor ,  a last-minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh ,  looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe ,  and her performance is quite strong ;  however ,  once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her ,  one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic  ( this feeling hampers the ending as well )  .  still ,  the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs :  romantic drama ,  a bit of travelogue ,  interpretive dance ,  an elephant stampede ,  and a perfectly-timed outbreak of cholera !  *** from ****
1	elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film ,  but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode .  it is the story of love ,  both genuine and illicit ,  as well as overweening ambition ,  devotion ,  and the arrogance of personal tyranny .  a previous reviewer ,  john mankin ,  questions why the central focus of the film ,  the mansion called elephant walk ,  should have been built by the former owner ,  the  " governor "  the late tom wiley ,  right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water ,  the river .  to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film :  the hubris of man .  that his son ,  played by peter finch ,  should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father ,  is not unexpected ,  since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models .  the point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking ,  and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated ,  but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd ,  and thus he would dominate his son and all around him ,  and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water .  who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water ?  this is the nexus of the film :  what will animals do to get water ;  what will humans do to get power or love ?  ceylon ,  today's sri lanka ,  is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story ,  not just the expenses of miss taylor .  were it not for this exotic location  ( much of the film was shot in ceylon )  ,  and the magnificent  " bungalow "  this would have been just another potboiler .  one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place ,  as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the british raj .  it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony ,  teak ,  and marble .  not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees  ( grille work window and doorway borders )  evidently specified by art directors j .  mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island .  such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought .   for those immune to the blandishments of time ,  place ,  and architecture ,  there is always the allure of miss taylor ,  as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man ,  against the background described ,  and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased .  as i said ,  it is not great literature nor even great film ,  but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today .   this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in ,  not on the home tv ,  so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope .
1	my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old .  i have never forgotten it .  i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor .   ( she was twenty-two when she made elephant walk )  remember ,  i'm nine ,  so the feelings aren't sexual ,  i just couldn't see anything else on the screen .  i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her .  she has begun to show her age ,   ( she's almost seventy-four )  but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived .   i have seen the movie several times since ,  and it is a sappy melodrama .  what saves it is ,  of course ,  miss taylor's beauty ,  magnificent scenery ,  the very impressive elephant stampede ,  and a well-made point on human arrogance in the face of nature .   all in all ,  a well-spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video .
1	robert standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation .  .  .  so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle's film .  .  .   the story is about a rich powerful planter  ( peter finch )  ,  who brings a charming and tender beauty  ( elizabeth taylor )  ,  into the jungle as his bride .  .  .  the plantation ,  of course ,  is endangered by some kind of wild life .  .  .  for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere .  .  .  the echo determination of a ghost ,  the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father ,  a highly dangerous disease ,  and the fury of wild animals .  .  .   in her confusion ,  boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face ,  a pretentious foreman  ( dana andrews )  ,  who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love .  .  .   with echoes of  " jane eyre ,  "  the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master ,  and  " rebecca ,  "  the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife ,   " elephant walk "  is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow ,  exotic dances with rage excessively colorful ,  stampeding big bull elephants ,  amazing mansion set on fire ,  all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent .  .  .   the movie gave liz a change of scenery ,  and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will ,  and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for
1	one of the first ova's  (  " original video animation "  )  i ever bought ,  this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles .  a cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely  ( for a comedy ,  that is )  background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society .   the  " heroes "  of dominion are the tank police ,  formed with a  " if we can't beat crime ,  we'll get bigger guns "  philosophy ,  and who are ,  like the name suggests ,  patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars ,  and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch .  most ,  if not all ,  of these cops are borderline (  ?  )  psychopaths and neurotics ,  giving new meaning to the phrase  " loose cannons "  .   equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries ,  terrorist buaku and his hench ( wo ) men ,  the twin cat sisters ,  whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time .   the animation is not state of the art ,  but it's very nice otherwise ;  the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion .   the english dubbing is ,  again ,  lots of fun .  the soundtrack of the english version is also very good .  i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that .  .  .   anyway ,  dominion tank police is great .  it's japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy ,  filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations ,  making sure that it never takes itself seriously .  highly recommended .
1	dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt ,  one of the most amazing shows ever produced ,  but not just in the field of animation .  while the first part  ( acts 1 and 2 )  mostly consists of action and fun ,  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part .  the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant .  you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  ( acts-3 and 4 )  .  i do have some complaints though .  in the first part ,  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all .  one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool .  buaku rules .
1	fact :  stargate sg-1 is a cheesy sci-fi tv series .   there's no escaping facts .  how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi tv series .   stargate sg-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly .  special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair .  or couch for that matter either .   but ,  and this is where i really think stargate sg-1 deserves all the credit it can get ,  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode .   in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies .   and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg-1 special .   i am very picky with my selections .  i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught .   so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show ,  don't .  stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about .
1	the anime that got me hooked on anime .  .  .   set in the year 2010  ( hey ,  that's not too far away now !  )  the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence .  seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists ,  the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks !  oh the insanity !   the  " heroes "  of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki ,  a red haired japanese woman  ( yeah i know ,  they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance )  who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond ,  blue eyed nice guy al .  leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain  ( also known as  " brenten "  )  ,  a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses ,  a big revolver and a bad temper .  britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special  ( a giant green monster tank )  doesn't exactly endear her to him ,  nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare  " where the boys are more your size "  as he puts it .  there's also specs ,  the bifocal genius ,  bible quoting/god fearing chaplain ,  purple mo-hawked mohican ,  and the pot bellied chief ,  who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics .  seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them ,  they're not very well liked by the people .   the  " villains "  are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as  " green peace "  ,  his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna & uni puma .  in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku .  the story ,  however ,  was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic  (  " manga "  )  book that's very hard to find .   all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred .  this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it ,  you'd better go get quentin tarantino .  uneven in places but still a lot of fun .   followed by  " new dominion :  tank police "  .
1	i stumbled across this  ( act-i )  by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago .  this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned .  it amazed me .  it intimidated me .  it shocked me .  i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later ,  i happened to think about it again .  then went and bought both acts .  they were even better than i had experienced at first .   my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime ,  warranting tanks and heavy artillery ,  it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals .  that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time .  if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda ,  it certainly has not been shown as such .   i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this .  but regarding the story ,  there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .
1	i love this show !   every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is .  i am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science  ( fiction ?  )  show in the history of film/tv .  there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion .  its amazing ,  season after season the show gets better and better .   i've been a fan of macgyver since i was 5  ( 19 now )  and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson .  its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other .   back when i first saw stargate the movie ,  i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks ,  then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited ,  but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over .   though ,  i'm disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead .    id say though that it turned out just fine .  maybe even better .   this show is amazing ,  and i hope it never dies .  atlantis here we come !
1	dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making .  the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action ,  slap-stick humor ,  touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions .  it's hard to believe that there was only one director ,  as the style changes from episode to episode .  a must-see movie for anyone who likes anime .
1	i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it ,  but have seen it 5 or more times ;  a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence .  kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example .   having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show ,  as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action ,  doing a fine job of support .  hugh o'brien plays the face ,  buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus ,  abbott and costello replacing the leads .  don't know if that was true .   all in all ,  a pleasant movie ,  but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history .  wish that it was released ,  as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades .  hope it is not lost
1	i've spent years looking for a copy of this film ( 16mm , dvd , vhs )  ,  so i could show it to my kids .  the movie is funny ,  and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business .  they had to be that good to play that demented .  i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages .   the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse ,  with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band  ( when not fighting the fires )  .  there's the usual running gags ,  plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra .  also ,  comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight-man hugh o'brien .
1	the performance by om puri ,  smita patil ,  and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely ,  along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani .  the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great .    i have not seen another movie like this .  it is one whole ,  each piece so nicely fit in the plot .  you cannot not be impressed by this movie .    amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of om puri .  om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system .  sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain .  the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty's at sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning .  smita patil does not play a main role ,  but her part is also not distracting from the main plot .    and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings .  saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble .  he is also the 'guru' of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble .   the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody .  om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya .    a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .
1	directed by govind nihalani ,  this is definite cop film of indian cinema .  may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop .  a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father .  agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop hindi films but this is different .  today's generation ,  which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- 'satya' ,  'company' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making .  the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released .  for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar .  its more than cop character ,  he internalized a lot which is something original in acting .  watch his scenes with his father whom he hates & smita whom he loves .  smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level .  my god what a natural expressions she carried !  !  !  shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me & he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om .  the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen- sadashiv amrapurkar as 'rama shetty' .  it's another story that he didn't get such a meaty role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra's b grade action films .  watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father  ( played by amrish puri )  & next both are sharing wine together .  how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love & hate for each other .  two faces of indian police force- masculinity & impotency and in between lies- half truth  ( ardh satya ) kudos to nihalani's touch .  the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film & best actor- om puri & 3 filmfare awards in best film ,  best director & best supporting actor categories .    recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films .   ratings- 8/10
1	after 'aakrosh'  ,  this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director . till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india . this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence .  it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released .  this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie' ,  'betaab' , 'hero' in 1983 .   smithapatel ,  in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him .  she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs . at one time , she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top .   there was another character in this movie ,  which was played by om puri contemporary ,  naseeruddin shah . he played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character . the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending .   in his debut film , sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare . the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent .  the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani's other film  " drohkaal "  .  even after two decades ,  this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew .  each one played their part par excellence .
1	" ardh satya "  is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema .  directed by the great director govind nihalani ,  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success .  even today ,  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india .   the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s .  unlike any police of other cities in india ,  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether .  govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment .   amongst various police officers & colleagues ,  the film describes the story of anand velankar ,  a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family .  his father is a harsh police constable .  anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother .  anand's approach towards immediate action against crime ,  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction .  the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . this leads to frustrations ,  as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction .  resulting from the frustrations ,  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars ,  also turning him to an alcoholic .   the spirit within him is still alive ,  as he constantly fights the system .  he is aware of the system of the metro ,  where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end .  his compromise towards unethical practice is negative .  finally he gets suspended .   the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core .  one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him ,  followed by short conversation which is fantastic .  at many scenes ,  the film has hair-raising moments .   the practical approach of script is a major punch .  alcoholism ,  corruption ,  political influence ,  courage ,  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today .  those aspects are dealt brilliantly .   finally ,  the films belongs to the one man show ,  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly .
1	an absolute classic  !  !  the direction is flawless  ,  the acting is just superb .  words fall short for this great work .  the most definitive movie on mumbai police .  this movie has stood the test of times .   om puri gives a stellar performance ,  smita patil no less .  all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment .  this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society .   this is the story of a cop  ( om puri  )  who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer .  the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops .  kudos to nihalani  !  !    after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus .  thus this movie was truly a trend setter .  this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade .    this movie was a moderate box office hit .    a must-see for discerning movie fans .
1	govind nihalani's directorial venture of vijay tendulkar's novel is brilliant .  om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty ,  played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar .  this is govind nihlan's most talked about movie .  this is a very good and a classic film .  smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri .  naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role .  although sadashiv amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie .  this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut . om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor .  filmfare award winner for best film , story , supporting actor ( sadashiv amrapurkar )  .
1	any story comprises a premise ,  characters and conflict .  characters plotting their own play promises triumph ,  and a militant character readily lends oneself to this .  ardh satya's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre .  the line goes -  " ek palde mein napunsaktha ,  doosre palde mein paurush ,  aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ,  ardh satya  ?  "  .  a rough translation -  " the delicate balance of right & wrong  (  commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts  )  has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another .  is the needle on the center a half-truth  ?   "   the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant .  it makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow .  at the end of the film ,  om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem .   the film tries mighty hard to do a one-up on the poem .  however ,  chitre's words are too powerful ,  and at best ,  the film matches up to the poem in every aspect .
1	i love jack's jokes like 'the cliché is .  .  . ' or  " over the top cliché guy ,  black ,  oily skin ,  kinda spooky .  .  .  "  .  he is just hilarious !  daniel's starting to catch up on him to !  good thing jack's not on the team anymore  ( in a way )  or else it would have been sarcasm mania !  !  !  ! i just love all the plots  ( season 8 ,  a little less ,  i have to admit )  ,  the characters are great ,  the actors are great ,  i'm starting to pick up facial expressions  ( and more )  from jack ,  daniel and teal'c .  .  . it just all theoretically possible and exciting .  .  . oops !  their i go again !  !  !  sorry ,  i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter ,  and all of this is driving my parents nutz !  !  !  !  !  !  !  well ,  to conclude ,  i think it's good for another three seasons or so ,  especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor ,  drama ,  action and so forth !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
1	the haunted world of edward d .  wood ,  jr .  isn't a particularly good documentary .  aesthetically ,  it's lackluster and cheap looking ,  the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive ,  but this adds to it's charm .  i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and ,  as such ,  there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits .  there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood ,  and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary .  overall ,  it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general ,  but don't expect brilliance here .  expect a documentary made after wood's own heart .
1	i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre .  i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed .   documentary about the infamous edward d .  wood jr .  covering his life and movies .  there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him .  they include :  vampira ,  dolores fuller ,  bela lugosi jr .  ,  loretta king ,  gregory walcott and paul marco .  interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations .  it is interesting  ( somewhat )  but was this really needed ?  i've seen all of wood's films and they're just terrible .  wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out .  i wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there .  do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker ?  i do like the fact that they didn't try to make wood out to be some sort of saint .  more than a few of those interviewed  ( especially lugosi jr .  )  pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear .  also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s .  still it's of interest if you're a wood fan .  the best interviews are with vampira  ( who tears wood apart )  and dolores fuller  ( a long time girlfriend )  .
1	i loved this film .  not being a swooning ed wood jr .  fan ,  i prefer to appreciate his  " boundless enthusiasm "  and acknowledge his shortcomings .  his movies are fun ,  but his personal story is one racked with pain .  i hoped ,  and was delighted to find ,  that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life ,  rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise .  from beginning to end ,  this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology ,  leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr .   what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives ,  positive and negative ,  and showing us their character as much as ed's .  we get insight into ed's personal and professional life :  from his romances ,  to his drinking ,  to his sexuality ,  to his friends ,  to his enemies ,  and even to his film making .   the film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for ed ,  as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful  ( sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president )  .  the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background .   fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies ,  and new comers will be amazed that this man was real .  the dvd is full of impossible to find gems  (  " crossroads of lorado "  and photo galleries )  ,  but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story .   ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him  ( for better or worse )  ,  to the point where one woman will go down in history as  " swimming pool owner "  for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool .  this ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally ,  as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr .  ,  but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created .  somehow ,  without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time ,  the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear ,  and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement .   even the title hints at the b-list horror genre ,  but by the end ,  we see that even this is a kindness .  what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood's legend .   in many ways a living contradiction ,  ed wood jr .  could not be condensed to a single viewpoint .  this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get .  being itself a juxtaposition of themes ,  it is at once respectful ,  provocative ,  thoughtful ,  gripping ,  fun ,  sad ,  kind ,  and fulfilling .
1	" the haunted world of edward d .  wood ,  jr .  "  is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as  " glen or glenda "  ,   " bride of the monster "  ,  and ,  of course ,   " plan 9 from outer space "  .  this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries ,  such as  " look back in angora "  and  " the plan 9 companion "  ,  failed .  it rounds up his surviving entourage ,  many of whom have passed away since filming ,  and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work .  nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood ,  sentimental in its treatment of the director  ( down to the haunting music )  ,  this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day .  the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer .  best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater .
1	this film deals with the atrocity in derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday .   the film is well researched ,  acted and directed .  it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry .  the film puts the atrocity into context of the time .  it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity .  the disgraceful white-wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with .   overall ,  this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking .  when the saville report comes out ,  watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is .
1	an excellent and accurate film .  .  .  mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off .  he is not afraid to tell the truth ,  even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy .   once again ,  mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston ,  though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough .  i found this movie as accurate ,  well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing .  well done and my hat is off to the writer ,  the actors ,  the production crew .  a great film !
1	the story of a drifter ,  his sheep ranch boss ,  and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes ,  but it's still very intriguing .  it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand ,  amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region .   this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan ,  and i've been a fan of hers ever since .  the cast also contains bruno lawrence ,  who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film  " smash palace "  .  terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter  ( regan )  .    sharply acted ,  with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads .  i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america ,  but believe you me ,  the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .
1	i really like miikes movies about yakuza ,  this one i saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head .  never before seen such a sick and twisted thing .  the story is good and the actors do their thing very well .  i haven't seen the uk or japan version ,  but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored .  if you haven't seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria .  the i-on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes ,  but at the showdown i felt that something was missing ,  about one or two very short scenes .   all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence ,  that's what i like miike for !  !
1	anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director .  in keeping with miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script ,  this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller ,  with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with .  what takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however ,  is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema .  and this isn't that nice cool ,  clean violence so beloved of us cinema - this stuff is nasty ,  painful and hurts !  that said ,  the pace is breakneck ,  the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities ,  miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments ,  and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be ,  making it hard to look away from the screen ,  whatever he might be showing you !  it doesn't have the  " ohmigod "  ending of  " dead or alive ,  "  but if you're not squeamish ,  now's the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio's  " new john woo "  shopping list .  .  .
1	the movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic ,  more pastiche dead or alive :  strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers .  but when a police officer is killed ,  one tatsuhito gets involved .  .  .  and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved ,  things get bloody quite fast .   an earlier work of miike's ,  shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts ,  though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces .  rather ,  it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction ,  as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground ,  a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys  ( one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning )  .  tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society ,  so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm .   what's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis ,  wang .  tatsuhito is a japanese born in china ,  later moved back into japan ,  and alienated for it .  wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china ,  so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan .  wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character ,  which is weird enough as it is ,  much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be .  and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother .  while it would be rude to state that miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value ,  it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter ,  dis-impassioned characters .   --polarisdib
1	stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie  " stargate .  "  i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject .  the show gets it rolling from the very first episode ,  a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion ,  dr .  daniel jackson .  through the first two episodes ,  we meet samantha carter ,  a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her ,  and there is teal'c ,  a quiet ,  compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team .    the main bad guys are called the gouald ,  they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain ,  thus controlling them and doing evil deeds .  any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a  " system lord .  "  the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa ,  who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person's brain .   through the episodes ,  we mostly get to see sg-1 ,  the exploratory team comprised of jack/daniel/teal'c/and sam ,  go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets  ( this device is called the stargate )  and they encounter new cultures or bad guys .  some episodes are on-world ,  meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth .   through the years ,  you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit ,  and more character-building story lines .  this ,  in turn means even more on-world episodes ,  which is perfectly understandable .   my rating :  8 . 75/10----while most of this show is good ,  there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years .  but still ,  top notch science fiction !
1	while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike's later films this is a very good crime drama .    the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster .  complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang .  the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust .  its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film .  ( it is a very very good one )  this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace .   a word of warning ,  the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty .  there are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex .  if thats not your cup of tea ,  proceed with caution .   7 or 8 out of 10 .
1	i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why .  one of the problems is the cultural/language one .  here we have a chinese/taiwanese/japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties .  another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences .  nevertheless ,  it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that .  plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence ,  a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect .  all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .
1	shinjuku triad society :  chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals .  why ?  could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk  ( and the victims enjoy it )  or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull ?  these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story .  it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon .   should you see this film ?  yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema .  the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters .  if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar  ( barring the insane ending in doa of course )  .  great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano .  the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd .  if i haven't put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i'm sure it will come out in that country .
1	shinjuku triad society ,  albeit from perfect ,  is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm .  it's a yakuza/triad picture ,  involving cops versus japanese &/or chinese gangsters  ( mostly chinese ,  as the title suggests )  ,  but already even in his first technical 'debut' ,  takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in .  social issues like black market trading of precious goods ,  in this case human organs usually from children ;  nostalgia for childhood and one's roots ,  which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2 ;  thumbing-of-the-nose at taboos like gay sex and  ( satirical )  rape/violence towards women ;  blood-curdling violence .  it's certainly not as surreal as some of miike's most recent films ,  but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn ,  following a track record of straight to video programmers .  it's got all of those qualities ,  and it's also ,  like the films that would follow from it ,  equally savage and heartfelt ,  crazy  ( in spots )  and sardonic in its drama ,  and solid for genre fans .   the story concerns two brothers ,  one a chinese orphan raised in japan ,  tatsuhito kiriya  ( kippei shiina ,  pretty decent as a eastwood-esquire anti-hero/hero )  ,  who's become a detective ,  and another ,  who's become a gangster ,  or a would-be one .  the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang  ( a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time ,  played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes )  ,  and his partner karino  ( takeshi caesar ,  who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal )  ,  who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie .  there's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters ,  which kiriya almost becomes a victim of ,  and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want .  it all leads up to vengeance and redemption ,  qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare  ( hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying  " it won't come off "  )  .   if it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have ,  it's par for the course of a film like this .  miike's goals are met ,  though just met ,  in his low-scale ambitions :  a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble  ( the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents )  ,  notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime ,  and what the realm of unrepentant sex ,  with both sexes ,  brings out psychologically in the characters .  at the same time ,  shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the miike oeuvre .  some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness ,  like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face ,  or the randomness of the  " interrogation "  as it goes into a very twisted area .  there's even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses :   " thank you ,  mr .  weeny-burger .  "  miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like ichi or ,  of course ,  visitor q ,  but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters .   as the first entry of the  " black society "  trilogy ,  as it's called ,  i was quite impressed ,  and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema .
1	this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy ,  and the trilogy kicks of to a great start .  the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically ,  and these themes are actually apparent in all his films ,  if you look close enough .  shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders ,  struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza .  the kid brother is a lawyer ,  and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one ,  as the movie progresses .  the movie takes place in a very harsh environment ,  and is therefore pretty violent and tough .  miike has done worse ,  but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard .  as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex ,  mostly homosexual in this one .  the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie ,  but with a great drive and true grittiness .  if you've only seen miikes far-out movies  ( ichi the killer ,  fudoh etc .  )  this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the-top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side ,  as seen in the other films of the trilogy .  and as always with miike ,  there are at least two scenes in this that you'll never forget  ( see it and figure out which ones for yourself )  .   8/10
1	a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true  " miike "  film and i thought this sort of description might have been a cliché .  but ,  like all clichés ,  it is based on the truth .  all the miike trademarks are here ,  the violence ,  the black humour ,  the homosexuality ,  the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character .  shinjuku is however ,  one of miike's most perfectly formed films .  he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different ,  but not necessarily better .  i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film .    as you might expect ,  the violence is utterly visceral ,  gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face .   ( only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that .  )  the film has a fantastic pace ,  unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle .  dead or alive also deals with similar issues ,  miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here ,  the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past .    i cannot sing shinjuku's praises enough .  i do not want to give away too much .  this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano's sonatine .  the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out .
1	this was the beginning of it all !  granted ,  this is not friends at its best ,  but this was the show's pilot ,  let's not forget and not a bad one at that .  we're introduced to the gang and central perk ,  where our story begins .  even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross-rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years ,  when ross says :  'i just want to be married again' and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on .  .  .  probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica-joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back .  something else .  .  in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes ,  the so-called 'flashbacks' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions .  nevertheless ,  the point is this a fine start to a great show .  this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them ,  with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was !  keep watching ,  first season is a blast !  !
1	here it is .  .  the first ever episode of friends ,  where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar  ( courtney cox )  ,  newly divorced ross gellar  ( david schimmer )  ,  hippy pheobe buffay  ( lisa kudrow )  ,  unknown actor and ladies man  ( matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing  ( matthew perry )  .  this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green  ( jennifer aniston )  .   the episode is better than most people give credit for ,  like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic .  the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters  ( apart from kudrow and perry- who shine )  .   matt le blanc- man ,  his acting was down right dreadful because until later ,  he gets more confident ,  but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails .   david schimmer- why does he over pronounce every word ?  he cannot speak normally !  but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons ,  but he isn't confident .  and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston- looks hot ,  and does a good job as rachel green ,  but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season ,  courtney cox- looks quite anorexic in this episode ,  its worrying ,  she looks totally different now ,   ( more healthily )  ,  she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot !  lisa kudrow and matthew perry- i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb ,  and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe  ( pheebs )  and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically !  the episode quality does improve later ,  ,  ,  such as the sets ,  they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly ,  the acting is ok ,  the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot !  i hope we see the friends reunite !  cause they will always be there for us !
1	and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started !  it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season .  because that's where  " friends "  is based :  on quotes .  extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts :  let's say a big thanks to rachel ,  ross ,  monica ,  joey ,  chandler and phoebe !  !  !  in our first meet ,  we see how rachel dumps a guy  ( in the church ,  how  .  .  .   ( understand )  ,  monica's search for the  " perfect guy "   ( there is no perfect guy ,  why all you women are obsessed with that ?  ?  ?  )  ,  and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian .  till we meet joey ,  phoebe and chandler in the next episodes .  .  .  enjoy friends !
1	the pilot is extremely well done .  it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes .  i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show .  it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part .  although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode ,  a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot .  an example would be ross and rachels future relationship .  even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared ,  it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice .   bravo .   a great start to an unbeatable comedy !
1	in the very first episode of friends ,  which aired 22 sept 1994  " the one where monica gets a roommate "  there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show ,  the line that plays is :   " if you ever need holding "  .  .  .  .  does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song ?  it is seems as if it is a great song .  .  .  . i would love to get a copy of it .  thanks for the assistance .  i am looking for the album/cd it is on so i can purchase it .    i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again .  it just seemed to be believable .  .  . thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years .
1	in this first episode of friends ,  we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series :  monica geller , phoebe buffay , chandler bing , ross geller ,  joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green  .   we discover that rachel ,  a rich girl that is monica's friend from high school times ,  left her fiancé ,  barry ,  at the altar ,  since she discovered she didn't love him .  she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father , getting a new job as a waitress in central perk .   ross ,  for the other hand , discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan ,  her partner .   ( we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode )   monica ,  in this episode ,  makes out  ( and eventually sleeps )  with paul  " the wine guy "  ,  who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife .  but in reality ,  he was just deceiving her .   ps :  i just loooove joey's and chandler's haircuts in this first season !  = )
1	why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy  ?  it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 .  proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film .   it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die .  the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining .   i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre .    6/10 come on yankies get your english up to par  !
1	masters of horror :  right to die starts late one night as married couple abby  ( julia anderson )  & ciff addison  ( martin donovan )  are driving home ,  however while talking cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road .  cliff's airbag works ok & he walks away with minor injuries ,  unfortunately for abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body .  abby's life is saved ,  just .  she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns .  cliff decides that she should die ,  his selfish lawyer ira  ( corbin bersen )  thinks they should let abby die ,  sue the car manufacturer & get rich while abby's mum pam  ( linda sorenson )  wants to blame cliff ,  get rich & save abby .  however abby has other plans of her own .  .  .   this american canadian co-production was directed by rob schmidt  ( whose only horror film previously was wrong turn  ( 2003 )  which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode )  & was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series ,  while i didn't think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i've seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution  ( 2006 )  .  the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i'd say it's a bit uneven ,  the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby's life & the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory & twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart .  the character's are a bit clichéd ,  the weak man ,  the bent lawyer ,  the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough ,  the dialogue is ok ,  the story moves along at a nice pace & overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit & i wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending .   director schmidt does a good job & there are some effective scenes ,  this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere & out-and-out blood & gore .  there are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual ,  there's shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross  ( images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser  ( 1987 )  & it's sequels )  ,  then there's the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box !  very messy .  there are also various assorted body parts .  there's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked .  .  .   technically right to die is excellent ,  the special effects are brilliant & as most masters of horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-tv show which basically if the truth be told it is .  the acting was fine but there's no big 'names' in this one .   right to die is another enjoyable & somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene !  well worth a watch .  .  .  for those with the stomach .
1	what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining .   " right to die "  is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore .   spoilers here :    top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen .  playing the character in a great  " aloof "  fashion ,  you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails .  corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts .   end of spoiler .   as a revenge-from-the-dead flick ,   " right to die "  benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour .
1	this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh ,  i think mick garris has a problem with women .  .  .  he kill'em all ,  they are often the victims  ( screwfly solution ,  pro-life ,  valerie on the stairs ,  i don't remember the argento's episode in season 1 ,  etc .  ,  obviously imprint )  .  i think he enjoys to watch women been burn ,  torture ,  mutilated and i don't know .  never least  " right to die "  is one of the best ,  with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense  ( specially with the photos from the cell scene ,  wonderful )  .  the acting is like the entire series ,  regular i could be worst like  " pro-life "  or  " we scream for ice cream "  .  also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode .  the ideology of the series is horrible ,  killing and terminating women ,  mutilating animals and on and on .  .  .  the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like  " cigarrette burns "   ( the best of all )  ,   " homecoming "   ( the most funny )  ,   " imprint "   ( really shocking )  .
1	i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a  " master "  in the genre of horror ,  since he previously just directed one horror film called  " wrong turn "  and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre ,  but fact is that he made with  " right to die "  one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the  " masters of horror "  franchise .  there was a similar underdog story in season one ,  when william malone made on of the best episodes with  " the fair haired child "  even though his other long feature films  " fear dot com "  and  " house on haunted hill "  sucked pretty badly .   the story of  " right to die "  cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia ,  but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance ,  murderous conspiracies ,  pitch black humor and comic book styled violence .  whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery ,  the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident .  cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially .  whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney  ( corbin bernsen of  " the dentist "  )  want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor ,  abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff .  meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices .  after a few victims ,  cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well .   " right to die "  is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like  " masters of horror "  .  it's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences .  the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well ,  yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons .  the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling .  actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks ,  which is always a welcome plus ,  and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard .  great  " moh "  episode ;  definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .
1	well its about time .  i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries .  while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries ,  at least this episode turned out well .  its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season .  in  " right to die "  we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey .  at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation .  abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back .  while they speak ,  they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises ,  but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire .  and this is just the setup people .  once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes .  there's also a side effect too .  every time she flatlines ,  abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people .  hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever .  from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it ,  right to die should have the right to go on living forever .
1	a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident .  when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state ,  the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live .  the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him .   this comes to us from director rob schmidt ,  who made  " wrong turn "   ( a film i have not seen )  .  with only one horror film under his belt ,  and not a particularly notorious one at that ,  i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode ,  expecting schmidt to be a  " master of horror "  in only the most liberal sense .  my apologies to him for my underestimation .  as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season ,  this was actually the best one yet .   the issue of the  " right to die "  is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device .  however ,  this is only the foundation on which the story revolves .  once the horror elements show up ,  the film goes from  " decent "  to  " spectacular "  .  great acting ,  great plot ,  great dialogue ,  great suspense .  i was a little creeped out at times  ( which is good )  and most of all :  the gore is in extreme abundance !  i read a review of this episode prior to watching it ,  where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of  " hellraiser "  in this .  through the first part of the show ,  i had no idea what they were talking about .  then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of  " hellraiser 2 "  .  however ,  i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film .  i can see no other way to create the effect that was created ,  and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than  " hellraiser 2 "  .   some plot twists show up later on ,  and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look .  i didn't watch it a second time ,  but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had  ( not that it's confusing )  .  the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice ,  and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him .  he's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story ,  if you will .  i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist ,  but he's completely unlovable .   while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the  " washingtonians "  episode ,  i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine .  when legends like john carpenter let me down  ( again )  i get a bit worried about the genre's future ,  but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope .  this one is a keeper ,  and please bring schmidt back for season 3 !
1	stargate sg-1 follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate .  in the stargate universe ,  humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa'uld such as ra and apophis .  for millennia ,  the goa'uld harvested humanity ,  heavily influencing and spreading human cultures .  as a result ,  earth cultures such as those of the aztecs ,  mayans ,  britons ,  the norse ,  mongols ,  greeks ,  and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy .  many well-known mythical locations such as avalon ,  camelot ,  and atlantis are found ,  or have at one time existed .   presently ,  the earth stargate  ( found at a dig site near giza in 1928 )  is housed in a top-secret u . s .  military base known as the sgc  ( stargate command )  underneath cheyenne mountain .  col .  jack o'neill  ( anderson )  ,  dr .  daniel jackson  ( shanks )  ,  capt .  samantha carter  ( tapping )  and teal'c  ( judge )  compose the original sg-1 team  ( a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons )  .  along with 24 other sg teams ,  they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa'uld ,  in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races .   the parasitic goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship .  throughout the first eight seasons ,  the goa'uld are the primary antagonists .  they are a race of highly intelligent ,  ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species ,  including humans .  the original arch-enemy from this race was the system lord apophis  ( peter williams )  .  other system lords ,  such as baal and anubis ,  play pivotal roles in the later seasons .  in the ninth season a new villain emerges ,  the ori .  the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy ,  also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship .  the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori ,  their followers ,  and their enemiesthe ancients .
1	fans of the hbo series  " tales from the crypt "  are going to love this moh episode .  those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on ,  will recognize this one right off the bat .   underrated indie favorite martin donovan  ( also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her )  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way .  he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door ,  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness .  in the case of right to die ,  he takes the latter approach ,  and it definitely works .   donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  ( robin sydney )  ,  much to the displeasure of his inconsolable ,  unforgiving spouse ,  abbey  ( julia anderson )  .  when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of  " making up ,  "  and she's horribly burned in a fire ,  he's reluctant to pull the plug on her ,  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  ( corbin bernsen ,  looking the worse for wear these days .  )    but abbey's never been one to give up without a fight ,  and that's where the ec-theme of the episode comes in .  cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky  ( and ooky )  supernatural shenanigans ,  and this case is definitely no exception .  if anything ,  the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere .   and that's not to mention that john esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist .  you don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story ,  until close to the end .  .  .  ( think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas ,  and you're there .  )   not a bad effort ,  but not the best of the lot ,  either .  at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction ,  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed !  as with most moh episodes ,  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment ,  so the extremely squeamish need not apply .
1	i was all ready to pan this episode ,  seeing that this 'master' really doesn't have any horror films under his belt .  .  but this is easily the best episode of the season .   the acting was good !  !  i don't know how he wrangled it ,  but we've got some real talent in this episode !  and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise ,  at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins ,  something that has been lacking up to this point in the series .   i especially liked the bit at the end ,  not a twist per say ,  but just a funny little bit where he becomes ,  as ever ,  the hen-pecked hubby .   really good effort .  like i've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes .  .  but they may someday end up being masters in the future .
1	maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff ,  but this one got under my skin  ( pardon the pun )  .  this piece is brave ,  not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies .  not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the  " screwee "  ,  i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself .  some parts are very reminiscant of  " hellraiser "  ,  but come off as tribute rather than imitation .  it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider ,  but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile .  this piece brings it and doesn't appologize .  i liked this one a lot .  do not watch whilst eating pudding .
1	this was a superb episode ,  one of the best of both seasons .  down right horror for a change ,  with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes ,  if there is such a thing .  a man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck ,  in which he was driving .  his airbag worked ,  her's didn't .  she is burned beyond recognition  ( great makeup btw )  ,  and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft .  but ,  even in a coma ,  she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology ,  and when she does die for a few minutes ,  her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit .  carnage of course ensues ,  and also some extremely gory killings ,  and also ,  some extremely sexy scenes .  what more could you ask for ,  you might ask ?  well ,  not much ,  because this baby has it all ,  and a very satirical ending ,  that should leave a smile on most viewers faces .  i just loved rob schmidt's  ( wrong turn )  direction too ,  he has a great knack for horror .  excellent episode ,  this is one i'm buying for sure .
1	but the fun is in the journey .   i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable ,  not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes ,  the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times .   yes ,  it's predictable ,  and yes ,  it's a cliché romantic comedy .  but the point is that it's a sweet story ,  the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways .   the dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts ,  and over the top for comic effect .  the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold ,  the actress there deserves honorable mention !  for those that panned it for being predictable - if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing .  .  .  then you want a thriller .  this is a romantic comedy .  .  .  it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life ,  and it has been worth every effort along the way .   great date movie ,  great movie for a happy cry .  .  .
1	this is a really old fashion charming movie .  the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies .  fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it .  the acting is good ,  and i really liked michael rispoli .  he was in rounders ,  too .  and while you were sleeping .  the rest of the cast is fun .  it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings .  i know .  .  .  sounds kooky .  .  .  but it is .  and that's what makes it fun to watch .  it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you ,  but at least you'll know .
1	as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known .  the two leads always have to get together .  late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together .  a clue was given right from the start ,  but you'll never realize it until the end .  it's a simple hook ,  but it works .  it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground ,  but takes a fresh spin when ever possible .  i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations .  it's a postcard of ny .  also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it .  so ,  if you like a good old fashion romantic movie  .  .  .  then this is for you .
1	does anyone know the exact quote about  " time and love "  by george ede aka ,  father fitzpatrick in the move ,  it had to be you ?  he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving ?  if not i will have to rent the movie .  this was a great movie .  i also loved serendipity !  great love story for the soul !    i met my one true love  ( my soulmate )  and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it ,  i wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship .    altho ,  we did marry ,  i wasn't mature enough to give as much as i thought i would .  i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years .    he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out .  i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years .   this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love .  i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me .   i know when he has healed enough to trust me again ,  we will remarry .   don't ever get complacent and take true love for granted !  it has been the hardest lesson of my life .    also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful !  this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting .  true love is worth waiting for ,  if it is meant to be ,  it will ,  no matter what ,  it will happen !  nothing is impossible ,  even when it's the second time around !  thanks !
1	i'd have given this film a few stars ,  simply because it was a  " lifetime "  presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here ,  new york city .  most on this channel ,  whether  " set "  there ,  in rural iowa ,  oregon ,  virginia ,  l . a .  etc .  ,  are filmed in vancouver ,  ottawa ,  toronto or some other canadian locale .   but if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site ,  it's this movie .  certainly not for originality ,  for this story has been done many times ,  in many variations ,  with several very similar to this specific one .  it's also been done pretty often on the big screen ,  with mega-stars ,  past and present ,  from cary grant ,  james garner ,  harrison ford ,  tom hanks ,  et al - and deborah kerr ,  doris day ,  meg ryan ,  and many more .  i can think of at least 10-12 more ,  just as prominent ,  past to present ,  off the top of my head ,  who could be added now ,  and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind .   not to drone on ,  but my point is that ,  in my opinion ,  this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen .  i caught it by chance on a mid-day friday ,  at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week .  i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made .  and ,  while the two leads have done enough to be known to most ,  they were completely unknown to me .  the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman  ( anna's mother )  whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days ,  and michael rispoli  ( henry ,  charlie's best friend )  who was outstanding as  " gramma ,  "  the menacing juice loan ,  tough ,  street guy from  " rounders .  "    the chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends ,  as a sub-story romance ,  with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later ,  is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre ,  but makes no difference to the enjoyment here  ( in fact ,  it enhances it )  .   checking some other comments ,  i agree completely with those which are the most positive .  the primary word describing this film is engaging ,  in caps .  this adjective describes the performers ;  the characters ;  the chemistry between and among all of the characters ,  in whatever combination presented ,  and all of the supporting and even minor roles .   i love films with a  " harder edge :  "   " rounders ;  "  the escapist schwarzenegger/stallone fare ;   " goodfellows ;  "  even the classics like  " casablanca ,  "   " gone with the wind ,  "   " citizen kane .  "  but for pure ,  uncomplicated enjoyment ,  this one was outstanding .  with a bare fraction of their budgets ,  it was equal to the results achieved by  " you've got mail "  and  " sleepless in seattle .  "  and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here ;  the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films ,  as well .
1	a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings .  the ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting ,  even though they are marrying other people .  maybe a little trite in that the  " partners "  are both type a personalities ,  while our protagonists are much more relaxed .  not anything heavy ,  but it made me smile .  and hey for the guys - sell the natasha henstridge angle ,  and the gals - sell them the sappy romance ,  everyone wins !
1	it's amazing that from a good ,  though not wonderful ,  film made back in the early nineties ,  a whole franchise can grow .  'stargate ;  sg1' is ,  without a doubt ,  a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi .   following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate' ,  this series sees stargate command  ( a military/science organisation )  figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore .  sg1 is one such team ,  headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill ,  and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson ,  military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c ,  who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people .  earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld ,  a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods .   the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life .  richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill ,  who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye .  michael shanks ,  as daniel ,  brings heart and an will of steel to the character ,  who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed .  amanda tapping ,  as carter ,  has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong ,  intelligent military scientist .  christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c ,  who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety .  and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness .   almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence ,  reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs  ( often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson )  .  guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers .  sg1 also excels in humour ,  from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd !  sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death .  it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show ,  overall .
1	sure ,  this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés ,  but it's entertaining ,  and that's what i watch movies for .  to be entertained .  natasha henstridge is stunning ,  even with the short hair .  her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised .  as for michael vartan ,  i'm sure the women love him .  the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film .  i don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them .  i guess we see what we want to see .   olivia d'abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch ,  even if d'abo's british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech .  to tell you the truth i hadn't really noticed it until i read these comments ,  but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me ,  but she was ideal for her role with that one exception .    it's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others ,  but who find their soul mates in one another .  it may be an unlikely story ,  but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries ?  it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube .  that's why we watch them ,  to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen .  i thought these actors did a good job of it ,  but hey ,  i'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily .  don't get me wrong though ,  it has to be a sentimental scene ,  and this movie had plenty of those .   i give it 9/10 only because i'm saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day .  if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies ,  or whatever ,  make a note to watch it .  i think you'll like it .
1	i wait for each new episode ,  each re-run with anticipation !  the new look of sci-fi created by stargate sg-1 is a wonder that i hope will never end .  to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me .  season #9 should be a thrill in itself .  i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season ,  as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill .  the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner ,  season after season .  you cancel this program in the next three years ,  and you make a serious mistake .  also ,  you need a bigger role for the asgard - they are just too cool .
1	a beautiful postcard of new york .  the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear .  it never did .  my teenagers liked it too .  my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan .  my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something .  this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done .  the ending came with a twist which we all liked too .  if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you .  as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did .  i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch .
1	i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work .  finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on lifetime movie channel .   jim larson's comments about it being a  " sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths "  were dead on .  writers probably shouldn't get a bonus ,  everyone else sro for making the movie .   anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it .   natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric ,  to say nothing of her beauty ,  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list .  her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for .   god bless her ,  her family and future endeavors .   this movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet ,  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too .
1	i caught this film at a test screening .  was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story .  well acted .  natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts .  the male lead was awsome .  very funny film .  takes place in the best locations in new york .  made me want to go there .  i just saw  " you've got mail "  i thought  " it had to be you' was a much better story .  fresher .   it was clean and great for whole family .  i think it will do well .  audience i saw it with loved it .  a definite recommend !
1	this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act . he sure can and is likable in this movie . natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles , so i found her very good and lovable in this different " sweet "  role of a schoolteacher .  some of the negative comments i read are true , the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all . also , even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together , i don't think there is screen chemistry there .  however , i enjoyed this movie . the locales are nice , the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good .  if you are expecting to see a great romance , this is not it . but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .
1	i just can't understand the negative comments about this film .  yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by .  henstridge  ( talk about winning the gene-pool lottery !  )  is as magnetic and alluring as ever  ( who says the golden age of cinema is dead ?  )  and vartan holds his own .   there is simmering chemistry between the two leads ;  the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots !  it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together .  .  .   ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue ,  watch this flick ,  you will feel so much better .  if you are already happy ,  then you will be euphoric .    ( ps :  i am 33 ,  male ,  from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess .  .  .  )
1	this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5 ! why not ! it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ . johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most , like our churches . the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it . great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans . at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians . thanks fox for producing it . as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece . movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves !  in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright ,  honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith !
1	this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash  ( adorned in black ,  of course )  who sings a lot and narrates a bit also .  if you like johnny cash ,  this film is quite enjoyable .  also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work .  .  . just for fun ,  try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair .  .  .  ?  anyway ,  its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .
1	johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories .  the music is great ,  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  ( i've been there too )  ,  and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion .  cash's narration is good too .   but .  .  .  .   1 .  the actor who played jesus was miscast .  2 .  there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music .  3 .  because it is uncompelling ,  i doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again .   i'd love to buy the cd .   tom paine texas ,  usa
1	there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years .  the gospel road was one of them .  i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again .  my favorite parts were the fact that   1/jesus was blond ,    2/the last supper was a huge meal ,   3/ he liked playing with the children ,   4/his death was for all people and for all time .   the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting ,  but it touched my heart at that time .  besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture .  if it ever comes out on dvd ,  i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons .
1	i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b-rated movie .  i came out surprised and very amused .  eva was good ,  but lake bell stole the show .  she had amazing comedic timing .  the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between .  the plot was enough to tie it all together ,  a woman  ( eva )  dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was-to-be husband ,  its sounds far-fetched but it actually works quite well .    7/10 - overall its a worthwhile cinema watch ,  if not get it on dvd when it comes out .
1	i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say ,  it was very ,  very good .  on all fronts :  script ,  cast ,  director ,  photography ,  and high production values ,  etc .  proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston ,  who mug and call it acting .  who'da thunk it ?   parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as  " over her dead body .  "  lake bell is excellent ,  too ,  and this is the first time i have seen her .  and finally ,  paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie ,  instead of lesser films .   a movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males .  it's too bad .  as other imdb reviewers here have noted ,  there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting .    and its depiction of contemporary l . a .  and california ,  in general ,  makes every scene look bright ,  beautiful ,  clean ,  and otherwise outstanding in every way .  never before has a movie made l . a .  look so good .  ah ,  what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie .   i won't divulge the plot ,  but as a long-time and hard-core atheist ,  i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment .  it reminds me very much of the old  " topper "  movies ,  which were also so enjoyable .   this movie exposes popular ,  but otherwise hackneyed ,  movies like  " ghost "  for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are .  we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre .  some of us save our praise for the truly worthy ,  however .   if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as  " into the night "  with michelle pfeiffer ,  jeff goldblum and clu gulager ,   " blind date "  with bruce willis and kim basinger ,   " american dreamer "  with jobeth williams ,   " chances are "  with robert downey jr .  ,  christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard ,   " making mr .  right "  with john malkovich ,  etc .  ,  you'll enjoy this .    a first-rate job all around  ( even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years .  )  but even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence .
1	ah ,  i loved this movie .  i think it had it all .  it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times .  yes ,  i am a girl ,  so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective .  i think it's a shame it only scored 5 . 2 in rating .  too many guys voting ?  it was far above other romantic comedies .  just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks ,  on the contrary i prefer other genres .  romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be .  but like i said ,  this movie had it all ,  almost ,  in my opinion .  great script ,  good one-liners ,  fine acting .  although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives ,  but so what ?  it was awesome .  i will keep this film for rainy days ,  days when i feel low and need a few laughs .
1	this had a good story .  .  . it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool .   i've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two weeks .   jason bigg's character was the best though .   even though it was small ,  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning .   this may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most ,  but the writing ,  direction ,  performing ,  sound ,  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool .   this film scored pretty high out of all the movie's i've seen lately - and the rest were big budget or better publicized .   good job in writing .
1	this is a great film .   i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this .  i had never heard of it or anyone in it  ( excpet mike from friends )  .   but it is great !  eva ,  lake and paul give amazing performances .  the humour is consistently dry and witty .   paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends  ( which works great )  .  the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic  ( i mean we are not talking 'apocalypse now' here )  but the characters are likable ,  the story is engaging ,  the soundtrack ,  production and direction all work well .   in all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets .   everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this .
1	actually my vote is a 7 . 5 .  anyway ,  the movie was good ,  it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it ,  don't misunderstand me ,  is not the funniest movie of the world ,  and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies ,  but this one has its own taste ,  a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends .  .  .  i think that not exactly but who cares ?  also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic ,  chris rock appears in it ,  the name is down to earth ,  men ,  that one its a very funny movie ,  see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr .  rock won with his movie .  i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher ,  however ,  the film is good .
1	i watched this on an 8 hour flight and  ( presumably because of the pressure and the altitude )  i actually found it mildly entertaining  ( emphasis on the  " mild "  )  .   the actual idea behind the film was brilliant :  a woman dies ,  her fiancé falls in love with someone else ,  she decided to make sure they don't get together ,  but eventually she lets them do it .  sadly the actual film wasn't as good .  ok ,  there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well .  but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on .  i think the whole gay-but-not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better .  the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest :  it wasn't really very funny .   in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me ,  but it was a close call .
1	i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all ,  but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics .   overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much .  this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven .  a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess .  the movie was quite short though  ( around 85 min .  )  but it was enough to tell the whole story ,  build some character development and have a decent happy ending .  the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow .  eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast  ( especially jason biggs )  kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace .   overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating .  hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright ,  it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it .
1	look it's eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend .  it's gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore  " sex panther cologne "  in anchorman .  if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies .  however ,  if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place .  the characters are all funny .  they work together very well .  the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell .  he's as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time .  i went with my wife ,  she enjoyed it and so did i .
1	i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it !  her inclusion as the silly 'vela' has brought the series down in my estimation .  to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake .   unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'farscape' .   i was a great fan of the film  " stargate "  and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film ,  but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked .  i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
1	over her dead body was a nice little movie . it was decent and entertaining ,  while still being pretty funny . there were a few cliché's ,  but i found most stuff fresh . at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all , when it started out . if you can get past the first 20 minutes though , the movie starts getting more interesting . this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious , and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful . it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was . i don't see how this movie was bad . it's rating is just a bit too low . i could've dealt with a 5 . 5 , but a 4 . 8 ? also , giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful . it was pretty good , and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 , which is what most people gave it .
1	in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review ,  this film actually was surprisingly good !  i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés ,  obvious jokes and overacting ,  all of which the trailer had promised .   however ,  after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting .  with only one 'toilet humour' gag ,  over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and ,  without spoiling anything too much ,  some of the moments involving animals are hilarious .   the staple ingredients of a good film are all there ;  script ,  director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy ,  this film stands tall .   sure ,  you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening ,  but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !
1	once when i was in college and we had an international fair ,  the russian section had a soviet-era poster saying  " ne boltay !  "  ,  meaning  " don't gossip !  "  .  i  " translated "  it for the  " generation "  of tv watchers as  " don't be gladys kravitz !  "   ( in reference to the nosy neighbor on  " bewitched "  )  .   however ,  when you see the result of gossip in the pvt .  snafu short  " rumors "  ,  you see that it's not quite a laughing matter .  in this case ,  the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states .  so ,  he tells it to someone ,  who tells someone else ,  who tells someone else ,  and it continues .  as in  " the russians are coming ,  the russians are coming "  ,  the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time ,  so that when it gets back to snafu .  .  . well ,  you know what i mean !  yes ,  it's mostly wwii propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the japanese - but i have to say that the pvt .  snafu shorts were actually quite funny .  of course ,  since they had dr .  seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices ,  it's no surprise that these came out rather cool .  worth seeing .
1	friz freleng's 'rumours' is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime .  produced ,  as were all the snafu shorts ,  to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films ,  'rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan .  when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing ,  it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war .  this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long ,  rubbery piece of baloney and several strange ,  fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military .  'rumours' is inventive ,  fast paced and funny ,  all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured ,   " don't badmouth the military "  message .  it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts .
1	rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring  " private snafu .  "  the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed ,  animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros . ' termite terrace ,  including friz freleng ,  chuck jones ,  and carl stalling .  the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu ,  and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel ,  i . e .  dr .  seuss .  the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery ,  using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example :  he was the dope ,  the little twerp who would do everything you're not supposed to do .  according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials ,  but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes ,  certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow-- all for the greater good ,  of course .   as the title would indicate ,  this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors .  the setting is an army camp .  private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine  ( something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era )  and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling .  we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted ,  then exaggerated ,  then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp .  the imagery is indeed vivid :  the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot ,  while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air ,  i . e  " balloon juice .  "  a soldier  " shoots his mouth off ,  "  cannon-style ,  and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction .  winged baloney ,  at that .  panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized ,  coney island wiped out ,  enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn ,  and the japanese are in california .  the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for  " rumor-itis "  and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell .   this is a highly effective piece of work .  the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy ,  and the message is still a valid one .  in recent years we've seen that catastrophic events  ( real or imagined )  can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances .  because the technology has improved ,  the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail ,  cellphones and blogging .  consequently ,  rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated ;  in fact it may be more timely than ever .
1	this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors .  these were called  " instructional "  cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character called  " pvt .  snafu .  "   all of us have imaginations ,  along with fears and what-have-you ,  and that's what happens here as pvt .  snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with  " five .  "  you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them .  that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause ,  as pointed out here in this cartoon .  a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy .  that's still being done today .     " we lost the war ,  "  declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon .  amazing how some americans still haven't learned .  this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today .  as i write this ,  there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the  " war on terror "  is just a bumper sticker slogan .  amazing .   the writer ,  the famous  " dr .  suess ,  "  uses analogies of  " hot air balloon juice "  here to present the above message .  with theodore geisel  ( his real name )  you know the rhymes will be clever .   nothing hilarious here ,  but it wasn't meant to be .  you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii .  people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning .  it was a tense time
1	though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing'  ( spoorloos )  it does have the same overall feel ,  except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric .  the beginning is great ,  the middle is fine ,  but the sting is in the end .  a surprise emotional ending .  as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film ,  but it is done all very beautifully .  never explicit ,  but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour .  it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one .  where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject ,  'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste .

1	tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei' ,  a novel that was put on the screen twice  ( 'spoorloos' and 'the vanishing' )  .  one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot' ,  a psychological thriller about two totally different men ,  egon and axel ,  who meet at a youth camp and ,  surprising enough ,  become friends for dear life .  egon is a quiet ,  somewhat dull person ,  who spends his time studying and writing geography books .  axel ,  on the other hand ,  is a charismatic 'party-animal' ,  a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom .  from the moment they meet ,  axel has a strong influence on egon ,  while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything  ( such as reading thick books like egon )  ;  ultimately ,  egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself ,  which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country .   after having read the book last year ,  i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it .  in my opinion ,  the book suffers especially from the complex structure .  while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people ,  the plot becomes more of a puzzle :  the many episodes are not presented chronologically ,  so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode .  because of this ,  the story feels surprisingly remote :  you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her .  another complaint was the fact that the main characters ,  egon and axel ,  are a little stereotypical .  egon is 'the' dull intellectual ,  while axel is his exact opposite .  in real life ,  such one-dimensional people rarely exist ;  in books and films ,  they always seem to be there ,  taking away a lot of credibility .   despite all this ,  the film was a pleasant surprise ,  being much better than the book .  the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography ,  humour and acting :  fedja van huet  ( egon )  is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting  ( which is ,  in my opinion ,  the highest an actor can achieve )  .  the drawbacks of the film ,  however ,  are the same as the book's :  mainly because the characters are one-dimensional ,  they are so predictable that it becomes annoying .  guess who wrote the script ?  indeed ,  krabbe himself .  it is obvious that this talented director  ( that's what the movie makes clear anyway )  is hampered by a deficient screenplay .  perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book .   7/10
1	'de grot' is a terrific dutch thriller ,  based on the book written by tim krabbé .  another of his books ,  'het gouden ei' was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called 'spoorloos'  ( 'the vanishing' )  in 1988 .  this one is not as good as that thriller  ( although much better than the american remake also called 'the vanishing' )  but there are times it comes close .   especially the opening moments are terrific .  we see a man ,  later we learn his name is egon wagter  ( fedja van huêt )  ,  coming from a plane in thailand .  when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border .  these scenes are perfectly directed ,  photographed and acted .  a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this .  later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman ,  both stating that they have never done anything like this .   from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward .  we see how egon ,  still as a child  ( here played by erik van der horst )  ,  befriends a guy named axel  ( as a kid played by benja bruijning )  .  we learn how they grew up as friends ,  sort of ,  and how axel  ( as an adult played by marcel hensema )  became a criminal .  egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman .  around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him .   the movie is chronological in a way .  it shows egon and axel as kids ,  than as students ,  young adults ,  and in their mid-thirties .  but from time to time ,  like i said ,  the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again .  every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults .   minor spoilers herein .   the title means 'the cave' ,  and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending ,  although it is in fact not that happy .  like the beginning ,  the ending is terrific .  the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes ,  only to come back at that point in the end .  it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending ,  although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well .

1	i started watching the show from the first season ,  and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it .  original movie was kind of childish ,  and i was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the bsg new season .   but after few episodes i became a fan .  i've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill ,  the not-only-smart samantha carter ,  the glorious teal'c ,  women and kids favorite ,  and brilliant dr .  daniel jackson .   of course ,  stories sometimes not serious ,  sometimes even ridiculous ,  but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend ,  even risking your life for him .  it's about  " we don't leave anybody behind "  .  struggling to the end when all hope is lost .  about the free will ,  and all good qualities that makes a human - human .   and now it's breaking a record ,  going 10th season ,  and still doing good .
1	de grot is a very good film .  the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé ,  who also adapted this story for the screen .  some really top-class acting ,  not only by van huêt ,  but especially by marcel hensema ,  who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf .  the film seems to kick of as a thriller ,  and sets an excellent mood .  then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf ,  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure ,  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie .  in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending ,  that will grab audiences by their throats .  make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie .  a must-see ,  especially if you liked 'spoorloos'  ( the vanishing's original screen adaptation )  .
1	indian directors have it tough ,  they have to compete with movies like  " laggan "  where 11 henpecked , castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots .   " devdas "  ,  a hapless ,  fedar- festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion ,  with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments-alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry .  but to make a good movie ,  you have to tight-rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum-dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit  " bollywood "  leading actor who is marginally handsome .  so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words  " defending his village "  this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience .  there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar  ( narasimhan )  .  nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him ,  meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson . this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india .  nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films .  the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song&dances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won't sell ,  a sad but true state of affairs .  faster this changes better for  " bollywood "  .  all said and done this is one good movie .
1	i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought ,  hey !  another film starring aishu and shah rukh ,  little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes .  shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance .  it's a film about transformations ,  ignorance ,  coming of age ,  stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life .  the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie .  it's actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze .  he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day ,  dressed scantily and begins to seduce him .  the title of the song is 'ishq kamina'  ( loosely translated as  " love's a bitch !  "  )  and it is just plain smoking hot !  don't miss it .
1	good movie ,  good music ,  good background and an acceptable plot .  but the main point again as his movies tend to be ,  the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold .  nana patekar .  this may be his second best performance after parinda (  others may disagree )  .  although other movies are not far behind .  one man that will never ever disappoint you .   good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without .  you can see in his movies ,  others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins .  but this man is really something elase .   the movie is cool ,  the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good .  a must watch .
1	this is probably karisma at her best ,  apart from zubeidaa .  nana patekar also gives out his best ,  without even trying .  the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag ,  especially when shahrukh comes in the picture .  what really made me like it were the performances of the leads ,  the dialog delivery ,  as well as the story ,  for what it was .  it could've been directed better ,  and edited .  the supporting case was even great ,  including karima's mother in law ,  even though she just had one shining moment ,  it was great to watch her .   the sets were also pretty good .  i didn't really like their portrayal of a canadian family ,  but once they step in india ,  it's as real as it gets .   overall ,  i would give it a thumbs up !
1	a strong woman oriented subject after long ,  director krishna vamsi's shakti- the power ,  the desi version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress sridevi's first home-production .  a story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice .   the story of the film revolves around nandini  ( karisma kapoor )  who lives in canada with her two uncles  ( tiku talsania ,  jaspal bhatti )  .  there she meets shekhar  ( sanjay kapoor )  ,  falls in love with him and they soon marry .  their family is complete when nandini has a boy ,  raja  ( master jai gidwani )  .  but their happiness is short lived ,  as the news of shekhar's ailing mother  ( deepti naval ) makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india .  and that's when the problems start .  from the moment they reach  india ,  both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere .  they take a crowded train to reach shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station ,  they have to catch a long bus drive to his village .  the filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive .  and unfortunately for them ,  a frenzied mob that beat shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus .  fortunately ,  they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him .  after that ,  they drive to the handing havel where shekhar''s father ,  narsimha  ( nana patekar )  lives with his wife  ( deepti naval )  .  nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place ,  but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome .   living there ,  nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him .  the day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb ,  she loses it and lashes out against him ,  insisting to shekhar that they move back to canada .  but terror strikes again when shekhar is murdered one day ,  leaving a broken down nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law .  her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film .   what sets apart shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie .  the only drawback is ismail darbar''s music ,  which fails to rise above the script .  the only saving grace is the sexy item number ishq kameena ,  which has been composed by anu malik .  another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast .  karisma kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother .  she is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal .  second is actor nana patekar who is back with a bang with this film .  his uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role .  sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors .  deepti naval too is in top form and her pr-climax showdown with nana is praiseworthy .  shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value .  though his role was not really required ,  he's done it well .  overall ,  shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening .  shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up .  so what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact .  shakti still has the power to go on without a hitch !
1	seeing this movie was the most fun i've had at the cinema in a long time .  however ,  i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film ,  because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied .  this picture has everything any movie could ever have .  it has characteristics of a romantic comedy ,  a political commentary ,  a thriller ,  a drama ,  an action movie ,  a musical ,  and an absurdist self-conscious art film .  it's all in there ,  adding up to a myth .   the basic premise is about an indian couple ,  nandini  ( karishma kapoor )  and shekhar  ( sanjay kapoor )  ,  happily living in canada ,  who rush to india to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report .  the rest of the story takes place in india ,  where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence .  at one point ,  the story borrows from  " not without my baby ,  "  but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice .   the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions ,  including shah rukh khan's dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie .  in fact ,  the two stars are on all the posters ,  but they appear really late in the film ,  and only shah rukh ends up being a real character .  yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance .   karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film ,  and she does an admirable job ,  having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion .  another notable presence is nana patekar ,  who plays narsimha ,  the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar .  nana patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character .   the movie is not without its share of realism .  violence is rampant ,  but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters ,  with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions .  at times ,  this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic .   i have seen a share of bollywood releases ,  and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm .  but  " shakti "  raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous .  it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy ,  where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained .  it is pure ,  gratuitous cinema ,  and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book .  perhaps ,  the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind ,  but i came out of watching  " shakti "  exhilarated .  making movies can be the most fun in the world !
1	okay ,  i know this does'nt project india in a good light .  but the overall theme of the movie is not india ,  it's shakti .  the power of a warlord ,  and the power of a mother .  the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth .  then things go terribly wrong .  the interaction between nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie .  shah rukh khan's performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor .  it is easy to get caught up in the love ,  violence and redemption of lives in this film ,  and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax .  the musical interludes are strengths ,  believable and well done .
1	well ,  i'll be honest :  it is not exactly a sholay .  but you cant get a sholay every week .  in fact ,  you could see distinct signatures of  " not without my daughter "  ( sally field ,  1991 )  in this movie .  however ,  as most  " inspired "  movies go ,  this one was a well-inspired one ,  well handled and well done .  nana patekar ,  as usual ,  tends to overdo his hysterics ,  but all others are commendable .  specially so about dipti naval :  saw her after a long time ,  but she hasn't lost any of her grace .  in fact ,  she has performed much better that when i last saw her .  another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age ?   all in all ,  a nice watch .
1	the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love ,  the exceptional performances ,  the steady execution and the quite innovative script .  the film tells the story of an indian woman ,  nandini ,  who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja .  all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india  ( of whom she had not even known )  is in troubles and the couple rush to india .  when they get into the village ,  nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture ;  shekhar's family ,  ruled by his cruel ,  highly cynical and merciless father narasimha ,  lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless .  nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home ,  but he is soon killed by his father's enemies .  when she wants to leave ,  narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india .  here starts the intense struggle which can be called  " nandini vs .  narasimha "  .   india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film ,  but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas ,  so it may be even correct .  the portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent .  such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world .  the locations are amazing ,  the music is wonderful ,  and krishna vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing .  one thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by ismail darbar ,  it is beautiful .  the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film .  portrayed realistically throughout ,  the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch .  its dialogues are superb and intelligently written ,  and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points ,  a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension .   the film's biggest strength is the performances .  karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini .  her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible .  she displays so much intensity ,  impulsiveness ,  anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son .  her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child .  after fiza ,  this is her most powerful performance .  one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen ,  nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha .  he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him .  patekar displays cruelty ,  wittiness and even humanity with total conviction .  he is outstanding .  another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india's most underrated actress ,  deepti naval ,  who sensitises her character to perfection .  sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief .  anyway ,  do watch shakti - it could have been better ,  but it is definitely a must-watch .
1	the movie was sub-par ,  but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci-fi fans ideal program .  the actors deliver and the special effects  ( for a television series )  are spectacular .  having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either .   stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs .
1	if any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills ,  this is probably the one .  i've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way ,  but having a strong feeling .  the movie was disturbing at moments .  however ,  the movie was terrible at editing .  the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs ,  yet they feel out of place .  like karisma is getting beat up ,  and the same time srk is fighting  ( comically )  with the police officers .  the ishq kamina song was very out of place .  on top of that ,  the movie is overly glossy in the beginning .  the direction was not bad ,  but certainly nothing one can brag about .   i have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely .  without them ,  this movie would not have an impact .  karisma kapoor has given her best role to date ,  and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza .  she looks pretty in the first half ,  and i've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her .  what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date .  nana patekar was excellent as her father-in-law .  not much to say about him ,  besides this is a role made for him .  deepti naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene .  though she doesn't have much to say ,  her facial expressions and body language was good .  the other good performance was the little kid .  he was adorable ,  and is sure to bring tears to the viewer's eyes .  the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances .  sanjay kapoor was all right ,  but he didn't have much to do .  shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role .    one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina .  the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song .  and boy aish is mad hot .  however ,  the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever .  people may have come to the movie for aish ,  but they won't brag too much about it after-wards .  hum tum miley was properly paced ,  but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie .  damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about .  dil ne pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie .  despite the poor editing ,  the performances alone make it a must see .
1	imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason ,  but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as '68 .  doesn't really matter ,  except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video  ( one of the first art works to merge the two apparently )  in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 ,  released the same year .  pure abstraction isn't really my thing ,  but i can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers ,  rohrschach blots ,  birds ,  etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful .  certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s ,  and deserves to be better known .
1	uneven bollywood drama .  karisma kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend  ( sanjay kapoor )  ,  has a child ,  and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist warlords .  drama and tragedy ensue ,  and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby styled thriller .  film is compelling ,  its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless ,  the gaity of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama ,  at least once we've left the comforting confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning aishwarya rai is enjoyably provocative ,  if ultimately misplaced as well .  likewise ,  the inclusion of bollywood superstar shahrukh khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce ,  and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with .  his throw-away comic-book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama .  the cast is nicely supported by nana patekar as the warlord ,  and the elegant deepti naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes ;  ritu shivpuri and rajshree solanki are also very good as sanjay's sisters in india ,  and very pleasing eye candy .  but sanjay himself overacts terribly ,  especially during obvious ad-libs .  the directorial style of writer/director krishna wamsi is sloppy ,  rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts ,  although his camera movement is good .  the musical underscore is also quite effective ,  moody ,  featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble  ( too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti's soundtrack cd ,  but bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums ,  at least not in most cases )  .  but shakti is karisma kapoor's film ,  all the way ,  though ,  and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with sanjay in the initial canadian scenes .  despite the unevenness of much of the picture ,  karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures .  in a strange way ,  also ,  i found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty i'd noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie antoinette ,  both of which i'd seen just prior ,  although shakti of course is an entirely different kind of film ;  but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism-controlled poverty in india rather than the elegance of versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal china's tang dynasty  whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .
1	on sunday july 27 ,  1997 ,  the first episode of a new science fiction series called  " stargate sg-1 "  was broadcast on showtime .  a spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film  " stargate "  starring kurt russell and james spader ,  the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film .  for ten seasons ,  it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg-1 .  originally ,  the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o'neill  ( two  " l " s !  )  ,  michael shanks as dr .  daniel jackson ,  amanda tapping as captain samantha carter ,  christopher judge as teal'c and don s .  davis as major general george s .  hammond .  for ten long years ,  we watched the team battle against the goa'uld ,  the replicators ,  the ori and many other aggressors .  at the same time ,  they forged alliances with the asgard ,  the tok'ra ,  the rebel jaffa ,  the nox and the tollan .  they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up ,  not until death claimed them .  and sometimes not even then .   as with all long-running series ,  they were numerous cast changes .  michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor .  daniel jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist/geek was jonas quinn ,  an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara ,  played by corin nemec .  however ,  shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time .  unfortunately ,  he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards .  don s .  davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go .  the show's original star and arguably its most popular actor ,  richard dean anderson ,  starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons .  his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons .  he finally left  " sg-1 "  in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter .  jack o'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and ,  truth be told ,  i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason .   the ninth season represented a new era for the programme .  with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa'uld and the replicators in season eight ,  many fans felt the series should go out on a high .  regardless ,  the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa'uld as the series' main adversaries .  three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention .  ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt .  colonel cameron mitchell ,  the new leader of sg-1 .  his  " farscape "  co-star ,  the lovely claudia black ,  began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious ,  sexy ,  hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran ,  a former goa'uld host and con artist from another planet .  a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons ,  she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season .  rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry ,  the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o'neill and general hammond .  for the last two years ,  they starred alongside the  " sg-1 "  faithful  ( michael shanks ,  amanda tapping and christopher judge )  and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise .   alas ,  all good things must come to an end .  during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten ,  ratings dropped considerably ,  resulting in cancellation in its august 2006 .  after ten seasons and 214 episodes ,  the dream was finally over .  on march 13 ,  2007 ,  what began with  " children of the gods "  ended with  " unending "  .  the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci-fi channel in the united states on june 22 ,  2007 .   in the ten years that the series was on the air ,  it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series ,   " star trek "  ,  in terms of popularity in certain countries .  it became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world ,  second only to  " doctor who "   ( 1963-1989 )  ,  and the longest-running american produced sci-fi series ,  having surpassed  " the x-files "  only a few months before it ended .    " stargate sg-1 "  represents the cornerstone of the  " stargate "  franchise .  in 2004 ,  its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled  " stargate atlantis "  ,  which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008 .  although plans for another feature film fell through ,  two direct-to-dvd films ,   " stargate :  the ark of truth "  and  " stargate continuum "  ,  were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future .  a third live-action series ,   " stargate universe "  ,  is also due to premiere at some point next year .   ( there was ,  unfortunately ,  an animated series ,   " stargate infinity "  ,  which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better )  .  despite the end of  " sg-1 "  and  " atlantis "  as continuing series ,  the future of  " stargate "  looks very bright indeed .   in conclusion ,  while  " stargate "  has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as  " star trek "  and  " doctor who "  ,  its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many ,  many years to come .
1	what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band .  this disc is not for the faint of heart .  .  . the music is incredibly intense ,  and very cool .  what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long .  it is true that their records were great ,  but their shows were the top of the heap .  in 1969 when this concert was shot ,  the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands  ( and audiences )  had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity--something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina .  what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise .  try the concert out ,  it really is amazing .
1	this is the who at their most powerful .  although before the masterwork who's next ,  which would provide anthems like baba o'reily and wont get fooled again .  this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's .   daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about ,  entwistle steady as ever .    moon is great ,  check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech ,  and see him playing  " side saddle "  whilst having a bass drum head replaced !   townsend even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally !   considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep !    there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one .
1	this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle .   the original drum and bass .   there seems to be very little early who footage around these days ,  if there is more then lets be 'aving it ,  now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether ,  a parody ,  a shadow of their  ( much )  better years .  to be fair ,  not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore ,  they've earned their respect and with overtime .   this concert footage for me is one of their best .  to command an audience of around a 400 , 000 plus strong crowed takes skill ,  charisma ,  wit and a whole lot of bloody good music .   we all know of the other acts on the bill ,  the doors  ( their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died )  ,  moody blues ,  hendrix ,  taste ,  free and many more .  the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see .  this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960's ;  woodstock .  the film and record had come out and so had the who's greatest work to date ,  tommy .  the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste ,  to be able to experience their own unique event ,  to be able to  " grove and love "  in the knowledge that this gig was their own .  to do this you needed the best of what rock 'n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd .   at two 'o clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m . c .  announces ,   " ladies and gentlemen ,  a small rock 'n roll band from shepherds bush london ,  the 'oo "  .   john entwistle's body suit is of black leather ,  on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe ,  roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair ,  keith in a white t-shirt and jeans ,  as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he'd preferred to wear .   the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours ,  performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as young man blues ,  shaking' all over ,  and then as on queue ,  keith baiting the crowed to  " shut up ,  it's a bleeding opera "  with tommy ,  the rock opera .  the crowed went wild .  this is what they had come to hear ,  and the who didn't disappoint ,  straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of  " tommy can you hear me ?  "  amazing .   to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history .   the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english/linear pcm stereo ,  were as in the states ,  i think ,  you can get it with 5 . 1 at least ,   " check local press for details "  on that ,  okay .   the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras ,  which is a disappointment .  yes ,  for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play ,  for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be ,  live ,  raw and in your face !   i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5 . 1 ,  and some extras would have been nice .   thanks roger ,  pete ,  john and keith .
1	this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as  " mitchell in malta .  "  at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit .  .  . not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger .  mitchell being mitchell ,  the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either .  oh well .  at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst .  i can't imagine watching it on it's own ,  however .
1	joe don baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material ,  and almost always under appreciated .  he's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero ,  and has the type of strong ,  solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him .  baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor ,  and that's what's so great about him .  he really seems to mean what he's saying ,  regardless of how cliché ,  obvious or silly ,  which puts him in a league with tommy lee jones ,  oliver reed and don stroud .  it's what made the walking tall trilogy work so well ,  and that same magic is here in final justice .  this was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s ,  and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era .  by moving the action from texas to europe ,  there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen .  to be honest ,  i've always enjoyed the films of greydon clark ,  who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s clint eastwood ,  and this is one of his best .  final justice is one of the lost gems of the late 80s ,  similar to man on fire in its true grit and violence .  i suppose if they remake this with the rock ,  a whole new audience will come to love it as much as i do .
1	kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie !  panaghoy sa suba is very good -- it has the drama ,  the action ,  the romance ,  and scene that will make you laugh .   while the story is not that original  ( a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love ,  japanese occupation ,  rebellion ,  american as lord )  ,  its presentation is something cool ,  especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the filipino ,  nipongo for the japanese and english for the american .   this movie will go as one of this year's best pinoy movies .   go watch this !
1	well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004 .  panaghoy sa suba  ( call of the river )  placed second in the recent metro manila film festival .  as expected ,  it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies .   it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen .  i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director .  his great vision and creativity really helped this film .  he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film .  also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio .  she did a great job portraying bikay ,  the younger sister of duroy .  i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres .  i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her .   some of the camera shots in the film were done very well .  the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different .   in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film .  i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film .
1	i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund visayan film understorey .   " panaghoy "  is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular  ( that claims more speakers than tagalog )  .  the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines .  downside :  the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist .  the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the  " period "  costume of the same character ,  and above all ,  his bright red kit-car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster .  without those small yet glaring details ,   " panaghoy "  would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating--daghang salamat ,  manoy cesar !  addendum :  this film sure beats peque gallaga's  " oro ,  plata ,  mata "  ,  which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war .  alos ,  there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's  " the color purple "  and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of  " noli me tangere "  .
1	as a kid ,  i loved this game .  i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew .  i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored .  then streets of rage 2 came out .  and we quickly forgot that this one even existed .   you play as ex-cops axel stone ,  adam or blaze fielding ,  who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way .  there are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x .  beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun .  level 4  ( the bridge )  was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river .  you even have the chance to become mr .  x's right hand man at the end of the game  ( at a price )  .  this leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate .  exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr .  x ,  but never mind .   streets of rage also has truly fantastic music .  the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis .  the main theme ,  level one ,  level 4 and final boss are standout tunes .    as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console .  but with streets of rage 2 also available ,  it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete .   pros :   average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game .   great tunes .   easy to get into and hard to put down .   cons :   vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2 .   poor enemy ai .  baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat .  this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss .   lack of combo moves .   lack of decent weapons .   bad guy models are repeated far too often .   graphics b- sound a- gameplay b- lasting appeal b-
1	all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done .  it may not be up to par with what everyone expects ,  but look at it this way .  would you expect perfection in hell ?  it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose .  it was great to see her character transformation in this movie ,  considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get .  i hope for a sequel very soon .  if we want live action ,  i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori .  i don't think lady death would transfer well to film .  but be that as it may ,  it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong .  no pun intended .
1	" stargate sg-1 "  follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg-1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole .   having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out ,  i didn't know how good this series would really be ,  10 years after i had last seen an episode .  my old impression was that the series was great ,  but my impression was far from the truth .   " stargate sg-1 "  is more than just a simple sci-fi series ,  it is one of the most well made ,  interesting ,  long running ,  exciting sci-fi ever produced .  and why ?  because it runs on an amazing premise .   this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television ,  as a medium ,  with a suitable premise ,  is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film .  the sense of familiarity created by a long running series ,  watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief ,  and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show .    " stargate sg-1 "  kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years ,  but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show :    - the first few seasons ,  perhaps up to the 4th/5th ,  focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations ,  keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul'd threat .    - from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul'd and preventing attacks on earth .  after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts  - the 8th season is probably the most mixed one .  it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned ,  but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments .    - the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o'neil .  they are both good continuations ,  although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak ,  because they seem to be about little more than sg-1 and human/jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori .   basically ,  after season 7 ,  exploration was pushed to the background ,  which in many ways was a shame ,  because of the potential and mystery each planet ( episode )  presented ;  on the other hand ,  it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were .   even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest ,  the feeling i have is that it could go on ;  the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer .  a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome ,  but ultimately things are as they are .   in the end ,  because of the fact that i enjoyed everything ,  it's a little hard to find that it ends .  the big picture ,  however ,  the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years ,  is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew ,  those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg-1 .
1	it's a very good movie ,  not only for the fans of lady death comics ,  but also for those who like animated movies/series of adventure and fantasy .   the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done ,  but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell ,  lucifer himself .   then she seeks revenge .  .  . and the rest you better see it from the movie .   i liked the movie a lot ,  the characters are like the original comics ,  form chaos .  i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics ,  only the last ones ,  after the passages in the movie ,  so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics ,  but .  .  . one way or another it's the story of lady death !
1	i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating's some people have given it .  it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated ,  now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me .  though ,  if you are a fan of interesting ,  strong characters and heroic ( sexy )  women kicking butt and saving the world ( hell )  you will love this movie .  i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie .  quite anime-esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation .  like titan a . e .  meet's the live action version of punisher .  in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .
1	i love the movies and own the comics ,  the comics are different then the movie but still i'd give it :  10 out of 10 .  it was awesome .  if the movies got anymore awesome .  i would have her babies .  and i am female .  read the comics you won't regret it .  yes in this movie since brian p .  the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work .  i mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great ,  but different versions for different people .  different strokes for different folks as the saying goes .  any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane ,  or does not like women ,  or you know just plan insane .  if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure ,  but hey there is always toes .
1	although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death .   i have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a chance .   the animation was ok ,  i got the sense of the 80's anime from it which is what set it off for me .  why everyone else hates that is beyond me .   character development was fine .  i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around .  for you who don't like it ,  obviously wasn't paying attention .  lucifer tells you how it happens ,  and she used his words .   creamtor was a nice mentor/soldier for her .  his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie .   i think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider .  cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d
1	rented this one accidentally ,  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting ,  didn't find out until i got home ,  watched it anyways .  absolutely fantastic !  a wonderful movie ,  and one of my top three favorite of all time ,  i recommend it to everyone !   the story is enjoyable and easy to follow ,  this could have been easily messed up ,  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together .   the actors themselves are fantastic ,  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job .    gotta find a copy somewhere .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
1	in my years of attending film festivals ,  i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution ,  and they end up in the $3 bins at walmart .  i just found dvd of yank tanks there ,  great doc ,  but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder .   i loved this film ,  wish i'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything .  i'd have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly .  it's good for americans to stretch a little .  if the film's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos ,  all the better .  cinema imitates life & visa versa .   also ,  i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars .  come on !  the euro is not hard to figure out ,  make the gringo audiences do the math .  seeing a film ,  especially one shot in paris ,  the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded :  i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me .    looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer & director as well .
1	this film has renewed my interest in french cinema .  the story is enchanting ,  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful .  i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie .
1	seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers .  perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth ,  or are we missing something ?  i'd watch it again if i had some incentive .   so what's a happenstance ?  to the french it is  " le battement d'ailes du papillon "  serendipity ?  fate ?  perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings .  we've all had these  ( it's called life )  but when looked at in this way ,  you begin to get the feeling that  " random "  might be more like  " fated .  "   a 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble .  all these incidents cause other events that  .  .  .  well you get the picture ?  dominoes .  multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen .  and i think that there's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this .  but then this is the magic world of cinema .   we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens .  if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape ,  here's the place to do it .  or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway ,  this will engage you while your stitches are healing .     " happenstance "  will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following .  stranger things have happened .    soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following :   " life can only be understood backwards ;  but it must be lived forward .  "  if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences  ( meeting your first love ,  finding the perfect gift ,  your last auto accident )  you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it .   that's the answer !  i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain  " happenstance "  to me .
1	" happenstance "  is the most new york-feeling parisian film i've seen since  " when the cat's away  ( chacun cherche son chat )  .   "   a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for  " amelie ,  "  its french title is more apt :   " le battement d'ailes du papillon  ( the beating of the butterfly's wings )  "  as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives .   tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures ,  and because she's part of a large ,  multi-ethnic ensemble ,  so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters ,  especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me ,  and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn't sure if they were doing that or not .    but i loved how urban the coincidences were ,  from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafés .   the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once .    ( originally written 12/8/2001 )
1	this isn't exactly a great film ,  but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different .  the film's main theme is fate and small ,  seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future .  in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors ,  though instead of focusing on one random event ,  seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion .  plus ,  an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film  ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy )  .   the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou .  this is capitalize on her success in amelie ,  though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role .  the pace is brisk ,  the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all .  the only reason i didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .
1	i first heard about this film about 20 years ago when i was a kid in grade school (  !  )  ,  it just so happened that i was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day ,  and under the entry for movies  ( or cinema ,  i don't remember )  ,  were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental ,  and one of them shown on the page was a still for offon .  it really intrigued me ,  since it stood out the most on the page  ( it was a still from the film of the scene with the eye with other elements superimposed over it )  .   about 18 or so years later ,  the public library here where i live had available for checkout the whole 4-dvd set of  " treasures of american film archives "  released by the national film preservation foundation .  so when i was reading the notes on the dvd cases for the set ,  i was quite pleasantly surprised to see that offon was on one of the discs .  after all these years ,  i could finally see the film !  after viewing it ,  it slightly wasn't was i was expecting it to be  ( it tended to be a more organic-looking film ,  not that that's a bad thing ,  but i was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic )  ,  but it was still an impressive film ,  imho ,  considering the techniques scott bartlett used to make the film ,  including hand-tinting the film itself ,  and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes  ( filmed off of a video monitor )  ,  giving it a more distressed ,  lo-res look .   don't get me wrong ,  the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972 .  that's why it's still one of my favorite short/experimental films ,  and a creative inspiration for me as well .  .  .
1	the first and second seasons started off shakily ,  with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones ,  and at times resorting to clichéd stories .  but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more ,  it became a lot more fun and entertaining .    the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men :  richard dean anderson ,  peter deluise ,  joseph malozzie and paul mullie .  richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better ,  peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining ,  and joe & paul never fail to make a funny ,  interesting episode together .    once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters ,  i doubt you won't like the show .  for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other side' ,  a good serious episode ,  and 'window of opportunity' ,  a classic comic relief episode .
1	narratives  whether written ,  visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters ;  readers and viewers ,  after all ,  can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who .  this is especially true in film ,  i think ,  simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema .  viewers like myself ,  however ,  don't have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs .   a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou ,  a french actress ,  whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain  ( 2001 )  and later in a very long engagement  ( 2004 )  ,  both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters .  this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways :  more characters and more complexity .   now ,  other directors have used those techniques before :  robert altman with the player  ( 1992 )  ,  short cuts  ( 1993 )  ,  gosford park  ( 2001 )  and others ;  paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia  ( 1999 )  .  stanley kramer did it with a mad ,  mad ,  mad ,  mad world in 1963 ,  a comedy of almost epic proportions .  the difference with this film is ,  first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second ,  some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods .   the basic  the core ,  so to speak  story concerns a young woman ,  irene  ( tautou )  who is told ,  by a fellow commuter on a train ,  that she will meet her true love on that day .  this occurs in the first few minutes of the film .  the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite  ( gilbert robin )  may be that 'one true love' .  and ,  nor does he .  .  .   they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter .  however ,  chaos results throughout the rest of the day ,  not only for the two young people ,  but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere ,  and yet .  .  .   if the story were simply that ,  it could tend to be boring ,  and even quite predictable .  not so .  the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace ,  but which are turned into believable ,  extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again .  for example ,  the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours ,  consider your alternatives ;  two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again .  or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen ?  consider again what would happen .  .  .   all of that is interesting enough .  what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene ,  or whether it was ,  in fact ,  the young man on the train .  that kept me guessing for a while .   i'll let you think about that ,  should you see this delightful romp .   recommended for all .
1	this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen .  perfect ,  beautiful ,  funny ,  simply wonderful .   i found this movie delightful ,  even with it's french taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on .  i loved it - it's a great love story .  and i loved the way algerians were woven in - and by the way ,  the music during the final credits is great .  i want the cd !
1	this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular  " amelie "  ,  both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role .  laurent firode ,  the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory .   the film deals with chance ,  as its english title indicates .  the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly ,  as well as hurricanes in the pacific ,  something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects .  from the start ,  the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other ,  something that is hard to imagine ,  but in the film's context seems to work well .   a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film .  irene ,  who is going to work ,  is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper .  irene ,  it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day .  after irene leaves the train ,  the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene .  it seems they are destined to one another from the start ,  but alas ,  they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film .   audrey tautou is wonderful as irene .  faudel ,  who plays younes ,  doesn't have a lot to do until the end ,  but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part .  the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film ,  which is as light as butterfly wings .   we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected .
1	to me ,  this review may contain spoilers ,  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen ,  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers !   i just watched this movie again ,  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie .  ever .  ever .  ever .  the real translation ,  'the beating of the butterfly's wings' ,  is oddly not used as the translated title .  i suppose they thought most americans wouldn't know what chaos theory is  ( except for those who saw or read  " jurassic park "  )  .  the movie is based on chaos theory ,  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events ,  which all lead back to one event .  the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect ,  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  ( about 20 ?  )  .  in a way ,  the ending seems inevitable despite this ,  but if you think about it ,  it is a perfect ending .  think to yourself ,   " what else needed to be said "  ?  it is at the same time a very brave ending .  too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one ,  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .
1	most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality ,  hence ,  every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 ,  part 3 ,  etc .   now with that said ,  i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it .  yes ,  it's true ,  there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min ,  but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters .  the guy who lies about everything is too funny ,  the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss ,  actually .  .  .  .  getting into all the characters here could take quite a while ,  but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while .   audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was .  in fact ,  as irene ,  her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first .  in this film ,  irene is a girl with good intentions ,  but over the course of a  ( very awful )  day ,  her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic .   what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building .  .  .  very entertaining to watch ,  great scenery and shots ,  very colorful and never too slow ,  and all of the characters can actually act .  the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .  .  .  .  this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense ,  and the whole butterfly effect blossoms .  i swear ,  it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while ,  and the ending .  .  .  .  it made me think  " damn i really lucked out finding this movie "  .  the ending to this movie is top notch .  whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant ,  because not only are there all these other subplots going on ,  but to somehow make them all tie in together  ( and in a sensible manner ,  which is the case here )  but also to make each character feel human and come alive ,  not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect .  .  .  very impressive .   i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime ,  in any mood ,  with any company or alone .
1	the mystery here is why this delightful ,  small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves .  simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti .    lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations ,  itÕs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and ,  unlike some of itsÕ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre ,  such as the taste of others ,  it actually entertains .
1	the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific .  according to this theory  ( somehow related to the chaos theory ,  i'm not sure exactly how )  ,  every action ,  no matter how small or insignificant ,  will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events .  this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly-unrelated characters ,  most of them in paris ,  whose actions will affect each others' lives .   ( the six-degrees-of-separation theory can be applied as well .  )  each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film .  the acting is finely-tuned and nuanced  ( audrey tautou is luminous )  ,  the stories mesh plausibly ,  the humor is just right ,  and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement .
1	we have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies .  hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies ,  noir ,  two reel oaters ,  etc to movies with a message .  we had blackboard jungle ,  on the waterfront and so on .  some folks might think that was an improvement .  i don't .  who was the mogul who said :  if you want to send a message ,  call western union ?  he was right .  these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy .   this one is a pip .  it's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's estate .  one of them ,  maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay .  he's initially in it for the bucks ,  but eventually falls for her .  meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance .  the results are predictable .  you get a little bit of everything in this movie .  sexual tension between the sisters .  a little subtle masochism .  hereditary insanity - if there is such a thing .  we never get to meet the parents ,  but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown .  one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar .  the acting is so bad it's hard to believe .  it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel-air productions .  it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits .  the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke .  it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene .   i can't explain it - not even to myself - but i gave this pile of trash an 8/10 .  i'm familiar with the term  " it's so bad it's good "  ,  but i don't think i ever ran into the phenomenon before .  well ,  maybe  " hot rods to hell "  ,  but this one certainly fits .  you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody's basement .
1	when a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash ,  his spinster twin sister ,  martha craig  ( madge kennedy )  ,  doesn't believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive  ( even though self-snuff runs in the family )  but his three beautiful daughters couldn't care less .  the pilot ,  jim norton  ( john bromfield )  ,  goes to work for valerie craig  ( kathleen hughes )  who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister ,  lorna  ( sara shane )  and the family lawyer  ( jess barker )  .  valerie wants norton to seduce lorna when he's not fending off the advances of another sister ,  the nymphet vicki  ( marla english )  ,  but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when norton falls for his prey .  all bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery ,  seductions ,  suicides ,  blackmail ,  a murder plot ,  the mann act ,  double-crosses ,  disfigurement ,  and poetic justice- befall  " craig manor "  ,  an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea .  .  .   this preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for written on the wind ,  also from 1956 .  douglas sirk's saga of a powerful  ( and powerfully dysfunctional )  oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s night-time tv serial dallas but the craig's low-brow excursion into insanity seems right out of it's sinful sister-soap ,  dynasty .  all three siblings  ( only one of whom is really bad )  are great beauties but it's kathleen hughes' cartoon villainy that stands out .  valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movie's many guilty pleasures .  teenage sister vicki is quite a piece of work as well ,  reminiscent of carmen sternwood in the big sleep .  when they first meet ,  she pulls the equivalent of trying to sit on norton's lap while he's still standing by coming on to him with the line  " i graduated summa cum laude from embrace-able u .  "  whew !   three bad sisters ,  produced by schlockmeister howard w .  koch ,  is a terrific trash-wallow in exploitation excess and the cast is b-movie heaven :  marla  " she creature "  english ,  50s hunk john  " revenge of the creature "  bromfield  ( once married to french sexpot corinne calvet )  ,  universal starlet sara shane  ( discovered by hedy lamarr )  ,  jess  " mr .  susan hayward "  barker ,  kathleen  " it came from outer space "  hughes ,  and former silent screen star madge kennedy give it all they've got -however much or little that is .  future eurotrash star brett halsey  ( trumpet of the apocalypse )  is seen briefly as one of vicki's victims .   b-movie rating :  10/10 marla  ( and her body english )  made marvelous movies !  three bad sisters was recently seen on the big screen as part of the palm springs film noir festival but the jury's still wiping soap suds out of  .  .  . aw hell ,  it's noir  ( 5/10 on the noirometer )  .
1	that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say .   ( it's funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally  ,  too .  )  only two of the sisters are really bad .  boy ,  are they bad ,  too !  one is given to pinup poses and salacious comments where e'er she goes .  the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe .  she has those sensual ,  slightly parted lips .  and ,  not to give anything away ,  she is even more bad than the other .   all three sisters are played by starlets .  the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john bromfield .  he had something of a career .   this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed .  well ,  of course not the first but the raciest at that time .   the girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members :  bromfield is shown shaving with an electric razor -- whose fetish was this ?  -- bare-chested .  he also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit .   there's a real plot here ,  too :  the girls' family ,  see ,  is cursed .  they are prone to suicide -- or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide .   the movie is not bad .  i truly don't know where it was shown .  maybe it was made for drive-ins .  somehow ,  and i could be wrong ,  i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here .  the women are scantily dressed .  they often resemble lurid covers of mags like police detective or jackets of dime novels .   but the guy seems to be the central focus .  not everyone in the movie likes him ,  but all the girls love him .  and i think the audience is meant to also .   it's lots of fun -- and on its own terms ,  too .
1	stargate is the best show ever .  all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles .  i love the connection between the characters .  if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it .  although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different .  i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks .  unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time  ( which is highly depressing )  .  however this program is very very good and is a must see ,  but be warned it is highly addictive .  so in summery i love stargate  ( and amanda tapping )  .
1	faith and mortality .  .  .  viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewish-american gentleman and a younger ,  african-american jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years .  .   mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems ,  and a terminally ill wife ;  belafonte's character is a career hustler ,  never settling on a regular job ,  and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory-- he must convince mostel to renew his faith ,  as it has been failing along with his wife's health  ( and his own )  .  .  but belafonte's levine has his own problems ,  still pining for the girlfriend he left behind .  .   belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should ,  and so the the ending is cryptic ,  and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending .  .   this is not a 'typical' hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith .  .  it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors .  .
1	the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine .  it's one interesting twist on the themes from it's a wonderful life .   zero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york .  mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade ,  but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working .  kaminsky is mostly bedridden .  he's reduced to applying for welfare .  in desperation like jimmy stewart ,  he cries out to god for some help .   now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently ,  but even stewart had trouble accepting travers .  but travers had one thing going for him ,  he was over 100 years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone .  god sent mostel something quite different ,  the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment .   belafonte hasn't accepted he's moved on from life ,  he's still got a lot of issues .  he also has a wife ,  gloria foster ,  who doesn't know he's passed on ,  hit by a car right at the beginning of the film .  you put his issues and mostel's issues and you've got a good conflict ,  starting with the fact that mostel can't believe in a black jew named levine .   this was the farewell performance for polish/jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back .  the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo o'shea playing a nice jewish doctor .  remembering o'shea's brogue from the verdict ,  i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor .   the angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society .  it's brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud .  make sure to catch it when broadcast .
1	*some spoilers*  i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms  ( acting ,  dated dialogue ,  unclear storyline )  unfounded .  belafonte is great as a brandoesque ,  menacing ,  swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so .  he learns too late how empty his hustling ,  materialistic life was without love .  mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny .  in spite of his prayers for a miracle ,  his bitterness prevents him from accepting  ( or believing )  in one .  the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other ,  the result being hilarious and touchingly sad .   the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film .  after looking everywhere for belafonte ,  mostel looks up to see a falling feather ,  and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles .  but belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle  ( either to restore fanny's health or mostel's faith )  ,  so he never got his wings .  the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel's grasp ,  a metaphor for both men's live :  it's too late and you don't get a second chance .  like  " it's a wonderful life ,  "  this movie is magical ,  wonderful ,  funny ,  but terribly tragic .
1	.  .  .  and i do mean it .  if not literally  ( after all ,  i have not seen every movie ever created !  )  ,  at least ,  obviously ,  among the ones ,  the many i know .   5 . 3  ?  ?  ?  the rule of thumb with imdb is this :  sometimes movies rated very highly  ( for example ,  the piece of kannes-kompetition-krowned-korean-kraap called  " oldboy "  )  can be truly bad .  but rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6 .  this movie ,  very much worth watching ,  is .  a disgrace .   true ,  i give it a 10 in protest .  the movie is not perfect .  its true rating should be an 8 or a 9 .  it has some acting flaws  ( belafonte especially )  ,  the script wanders around ,  sometimes .  however ,  what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times ,  the czech jan kadar ,  directing two of the greatest actors of all time ,  the beloved ,  larger-than-life zero mostel and the sublime ida kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force .  a pair made in heaven !  it's true that this movie ,  little flaws apart ,  does not pander to the average audiences ,  but those interested in watching an excellent  ( while ,  again ,  not beyond criticism )  movie of the incomparable director who gave us  " the shop on the main street "   ( the best movie ever about holocaust )  should not miss this just because some silly imdb rating system decides that  " american beauty "  is better than  " the angel levine "  .   it isn't .
1	i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film ,   as it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it ,  or were stupid enough to pay to see it .   the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back .  elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can .   it's an ok monster flick ,  compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made .  way better !  !  !  !
1	i was around 7 when i saw this movie first .  it wasn't so special then , but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun , a lot :  )   i think the best parts of the film are :  yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also .   if you wanna watch this movie  , don't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster , even this film was made from approx .  1000 dollars  :  )    i've a copy of it . movie and video version as well ( but i don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas )   watch it , enjoy it !  !  ! yeti for ever !  !  !
1	most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm .  not so this gloriously bent ,  batty and berserk over-the-top italian-made shot-in-canada kitsch gut-buster :  it's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked  " what the hell's going on ?  "  crackpot excess and inanity .   a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70's disco stud  ( complete with jumbo wavy afro )  perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice .  they dethaw the beast ,  jolt him back to life with electric charges ,  grossly mistreat him ,  and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth .  before you can say  " hey ,  the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'king kong' ,  "  our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage ,  grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen  ( the gorgeous pheonix grant )  he lays lustful eyes on ,  and storms away with his new lady love .  the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience .  of course ,  he breaks free again ,  nabs the vixen ,  and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage .   the sublimely stupid dialogue  ( sample line :   " philosophy has no place in science ,  professor "  )  ,  cheesy  ( far from )  special effects  ( the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw-dropping awfulness )  ,  clunky  ( mis ) direction ,  and a heavy-handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere  " is the yeti a man or a beast ?  "  ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen .  better still ,  we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew :  the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti's nipples ,  which causes it to harden and elicits a big ,  leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth  (  !  )  ;  the vixen nurses the yeti's wounded hand while he makes goo-goo eyes at her ,  the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building ,  and the furry fellow even breaks a man's neck with his toes  (  !  !  )  .  overall ,  this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should-be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following .
1	being a giant monster fan ,  me seeing  " yeti "  was an absolute must ,  especially after hearing so much about it .  thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily ,  and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually ,  dare i say ,  decent .   decent for what it is ,  actually ,  namely a cheesy giant-monster flick .  it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately ,  and we get introduced to various characters .  they consist of some sleazy ones ,  some good ones ,  and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film ,  by far .   yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert ,  and really ,  he's not that bad of a dude ,  especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing .  godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening ,  he doesn't even rampage  ( actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture )  ,  but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out .  yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely  ( my copy was dubbed in english )  and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are .   however ,  we want to see the giant yeti do his thing ,  and he's pretty much in the whole movie ,  and in typical low-budget fashion ,  he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the  " fake legs "  shots of him just standing there .   yes ,  the special effects aren't the greatest ,  but there are definitely some good ones here .  a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well ,  and in another ,  he uses the windows of a building as  " ladder steps "  to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much ,  much better than it should in such a  " bad "  movie .    " yeti "  never stoops as low as say ,   " a . p . e .  "  does .  actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an  " oh yeah baby "  manner .  but even this isn't that bad ,  and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer .   the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing ,  but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring - the story is actually good ,  and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy .    " yeti "  may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks ,  but it is definitely better than other king kong '76 rip-offs like  " a . p . e .  "  and  " queen kong "  by very far .
1	yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made .  i saw it at a midnight screening in l . a .  and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does !  the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes ,  there is a mute boy  ( who sorta kinda looks like a girl )  and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents  ( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ?  ?  )  .  then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti  ( once he thaws - which takes forever )  -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes  " bedroom eyes "  at her - it's like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie .  in fact ,  once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the yeti's nipple and yes ,  the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard !  !  !  !  yikes of all yikes !  plus there's a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie - there's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl's hair  " gee ,  thanks yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout .  you're the best .  "  this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up .  if you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out .
1	people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs- congo ,  king kong vs .  godzilla ,  king kong  ( 1976 )  ,  they all ripoff one another ,  but yeti stands on its own .  it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female .   the yeti myth is based on bigfoot  ( not like king kong ) and archeologists have been fascinated it ,  at one time they did exist , but there is no scientific data to prove it .   this movie is hard to find  , but its worth watching it .  the first time i watched it was on  " elvira's mistress of the dark shows "  in the early 1980's .  it sent chills down my spine as a kid ,  especially when the yeti got mad .  i saw it again ,  around 1 : 00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago .  seeing it again made me appreciate it more ,  it has some overall good effects  ( for its time )  and the story involves a mute boy and his dog ,  and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes .  also the music is pretty cool , its very yeti like .   : - )   gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere .   vote 7 and half out of 10 .
1	this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years .  i will sadly miss it .  although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit .   the last ever episode of sg1 ( on television anyway ) was beautifully done .  robert wrote something that felt close to reality .  as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show .   ( everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs .  but over the years they've turned into a family )  .  i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms .   sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement .  the wonderful characters ,  stories ,  directors ,  writers .  from episode one i was hooked .  the blend of action ,  science ,  drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more .   there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me .  i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years .  it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible .   i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them .  i never want the show to die .   stargate sg1 - 1997 - 2007 ?
1	here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite ,  fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity .  this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness ,  but successfully predicted much of peter jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name ,  as far as a  " romance "  between the giant  ( here a yeti )  and a gorgeous human female  ( antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi's city of the living dead ,  who is very easy on the eyes )  .   the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package ,  the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness .  but as a trade-off you do get a wacky old scientist ,  two inquisitive kids ,  tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain ,  a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure  ( dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while )  and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti ,  who turns out to be the good guy ,  glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands ,  a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot ,  some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison ,  crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either spanish ,  italian or canadian extras depending upon scene  ( you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed )  ,  and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie .   it's here that the film won me over :  it's enthusiasm just for being made .  frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and god's gun the year before this & was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work .  i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever ,  or rather the one he took the most chances with ,  and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families .  the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless .  or rather they are part of the fun ,  and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- which is exactly why peter jackson's movie sucked .    he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators ,  and with all it's faults + clunkiness ,  kramer's yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this ,  which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages ,  not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space .  i'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it !  curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever .  because the movie looks so  " fake "  you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked ,  trampled ,  tossed about and smashed .  knowing that and armed with a fertile ,  energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie ,  parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend .  this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid .   10/10 ,  it's about ten minutes too long but who cares ,  you only come around once and i'd rather go out with a smile on my face .
1	having seen most of ringo lam's films ,  i can say that this is his best film to date ,  and the most unusual .  it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts ,  where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters .  the action is fantastic ,  the story is tense and entertaining ,  and the set design is truely memorable .  sadly ,  burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on ,  even if you near the second biggest china-town in north america  ( like i do )  .  if you can find it ,  don't pass it up .
1	i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies ,  but all of them failed to meet my expectations .  .  . until now !  burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have ,  nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film .  the story is not complex ,  but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some  " intelligent "  space  ( the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger ,  but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me )  .  there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie ,  from the first one ( which is one of the coolest i have ever seen ,  yet so short )  to the last main scenes !  but mind ,  there's also a lot of blood that flows  ( people cut in half ,  decapitated ,  etc )  .  the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical  ( notice :  the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall !  )  .  yep ,  it's not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film ,  it's ringo lam !  and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director !  ace .
1	" burning paradise "  is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism .  when one watches the film ,  they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter ,  it's attitude and atmosphere that counts .  this great film has both !  !  always trying to be different than his contemporaries ,  lam gives us to traditional heroes ( fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan ) and puts them in a  " raiders of the lost ark "  setting .  however ,  these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie .  instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results .  what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime ,  there is no holding back .  too bad ,  they don't make films like this more often .
1	an unusual film from ringo lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated .  the mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes .  a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse .  several horses get chopped up .  it's very unexpected .   the story is very simple ,  fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple .  the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood .    the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak .  blood is everywhere .  the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time .  sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film .    find this one ,  it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties .  just remember it's not child friendly .
1	hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones .  the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers .  as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes .  where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure .  sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .
1	this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong's 'new wave' that began with tsui hark's  " zu :  warriors of magic mountain "  .  tsui set a tone for the new wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  ( jackie chan ,  sammo hung ,  wong jing ,  ching siu tung ,  etc .  )  accepted from then on as a given ;  namely ,  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony ,  if not outright comedy .   " burning paradise "  put a stop to all that ,  and with a vengeance .   it's not that there isn't humor here ;  but it is a purely human humor ,  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw .  but this is just as humans are ,  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time .   when irony is at last introduced into the film ,  it is the nastiest possible ,  emanating from the 'abbot' of red lotus temple ,  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before .  he is the very incarnation of milton's satan from  " paradise lost "  :   " better to rule in hell than serve in heaven !  "  and if he can't get to satan's hell soon enough ,  he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule .   that's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here :  it's not that the abbot just wants to kill people ;  he wants them to despair ,  to feel utterly hopeless ,  to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality .  thus there's a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe ,  and the abbot ,  claiming mastery of infinite power ,  is in charge .   of course ,  fortunately ,  the film doesn't end there .  though there are losses ,  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails .   ( if you want to know how ,  see the film !  )  yet there is no doubt that ,  in viewing this film ,  we visit hell .  hopefully ,  we do not witness our own afterlives ;  but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all .
1	people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie ,  and this movie is no exception .  some movies i love did poorly at the box office but ,  i'm glad to say ,  this movie isn't one of them  ( over nine million dollars ,  which i don't think was bad for back then )  .  the characters were fun ,  the animation was clear and not fuzzy ,  and the music was modern ,  too ,  which is unusual for an animated movie .  i didn't think professor screw eyes or his  " scary cirus "  was too scary for little kids  ( the targeted audience for this movie )  ,  but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie .  overall ,  this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years .
1	i disagree with anyone who done't like this movie .    i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do .  it's sweet ,  funny and warms your heart .  and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed .    and even though it didn't have much of a story ,  it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up .    oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish's and dreams can come true .   ( tear ,  tear )   i love this movie ,  personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say  " shame on you .  "  because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it .

1	i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart ,  but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5 . 4 rating to one of my childhood favourites .  it doesn't wow me as much at 17 ,  but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie .  kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws ,  and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film .  none of the film was preachy in any way ,  in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness .  i will admit though that the story is on the thin side ,  and some scenes like screweyes's death ( which still freaks me out )  may be a tad on the scary side .  but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation .  the music by james horner is very beautiful ,  and the song featured is memorable ,  catchy and amusing .  i really liked the characters ,  louie is probably the most in-depth of them all ,  but the dinosaurs were at least engaging .  martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic ,  the part when he tells screweyes  " i quit !  "  had me in stitches .  my favourite is screweyes though ,  an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent .  if anything though ,  i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth .  the script ,  while not oscar-worthy ,  has its funny and heart-warming parts ,  and should keep kids and adults entertained .  the voice acting for me was what made the movie .  john goodman ,  martin short ,  rhea perlman ,  felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances ,  but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable .  all in all ,  this is a good movie .  i don't get the rating ,  honestly i don't .  sure this film isn't perfect ,  and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time ,  but it is good fun .  7 . 5/10 bethany cox
1	i saw this when it first came to video ,  my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time .  .  .  what stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have ,  where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal ,  that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say .  this is what i like the most about the movie i guess ,  that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through .  .  .  they don't break up and make up ,  they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on .   these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track ,  they're not that different .  loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family ,  and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone .  anyway ,  i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again .  .  .  sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no ,  woog and dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality .   now ,  what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness .  little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr .  screweyes .  and ,  the addition of him halfway through the movie  ( though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance )  is too abrupt .  .  .  there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie ,  perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs .  i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie ,  so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half .   considering the target audience ,  who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues .  .  .  i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too ,  and just enjoy the story .  it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind .  .  .  makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think .
1	its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids  ( if they like dinosaurs that is )  i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any
1	i wouldn't call  " we're back !  a dinosaur's story "  simply a kiddie version of  " jurassic park "  .  i found it more interesting than that .  like the former ,  it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours .  but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices :  john goodman ,  rhea perlman ,  jay leno ,  walter cronkite ,  julia child ,  kenneth mars ,  yeardley smith ,  martin short and larry king .  to paraphrase that :  a given actor ,  the  " cheers "  woman ,  the  " tonight show "  host ,  the most trusted name in news ,  a famous chef ,  the  " young frankenstein "  police chief ,  lisa simpson ,  one of the three amigos and the cnn guy .   but i guess that i shouldn't focus only on the cast .  i thought that this movie had something for both children  ( purely fun )  and adults  ( natural history )  .  true ,  it's escapism ,  but the perceptive kind .  i would actually say that john goodman doing rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in  " monsters inc "  .  worth seeing .
1	this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young ,  it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies .  .  .  lovable dinosaurs ,  cute kids ,  an eccentric villain ,  and a few great songs  ( and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs ,  but ones that are atually entertaining )  !  i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever !  i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie ,  and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations !  sorry not the most informative ,  i'm in kinda a rush .  .  .  just please ,  trust me .  all who go against this movie are killing their inner child !
1	this movie has to be my favorite of all time .  its not supposed to have a plot ,  because its makers wanted people  ( charlie sheen ,  i think ) to believe it was a real snuff film .  this was an exercise in visual effects ,  and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does .  movies these days are now all about sound effects ,  leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with cgi blood .  there still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing .  there is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film .  have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ?  the rape scene was funny instead of shocking .  although i'm sure there are some gonzo porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror .  but since they probably suck at making films ,  they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off .  the movie  " baise moi "  has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks .   its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all ,  especially when talking about an ao or nc-17 rating .  i'm sure eli roth has the ability/talent to make his hostel film series much much better ,  but he has too tame it down to get an r rating .  .  . or at least i hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations .   watch traces of death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want no frills real footage  ( accident & crime scenes/footage )  .  don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 .  the fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film .  that would be like someone saying the 8bit super mario brothers sucks because the ps3 has better graphics .
1	this movie is banned in just about every foreign country i can think of .  the japanese people  (  ?  )  who star in this must have been really desperate for a job ,  or we're just friends .  here's the scoop :   three thugs torture the hell out of a helpless woman ,  they use all kinds of things to eventually kill her ,  they burn her ,  kick her ,  spin here around in a chair  ( over 200 times !  )  ,  they use sound torture  ( by forcing her to listen to a static sound for over 20 hours !  it don't sound that bad at all ,  but it can make you go nuts )  .  they throw guts  ( probably from an animal )  at her while shes knocked out ,  and she freaks when she wakes up .  and who can forget the grande finale the greatest eyeball torture i have ever seen !   if you have not heard of these films ,  and watch one without knowing that it is a simulated snuff film ,  you will think it is !   ( just ask charlie sheen )  this is guaranteed to freak people out and make some sick !  like i said pure underground .  check it out if you are a fan of underground horror ,  or foreign gore .  if your not i highly recommend you read-up on the series before watching !  from the gore ,  shock ,  and creativity aspect it gets a 10 ,  but from the storyline and all that stuff it is a 1 .  an underground classic .  .  .   my final rating is a 8/10
1	i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick  " snuff "  .  i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set .  i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one ,  so my interest was peaked .   devil's experiment is a short film with no story ,  no character development .  just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes .  they torture her in various ways like beating her ,  spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol ,  forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours ,  smash her hand with a mallet ,  burning and putting maggots on the burns ,  throwing guts at her ,  and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye .   i must say that a lot of this movie was fake ,  like the beating scenes .  but then ,  some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out .  the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it .  or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about .  the worst is the eye scene .  i didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought  " damn ,  that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie "  .  i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer .  7/10
1	this is the first out of the guinea pig series ,  and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection .   it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films .  i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date .  so i popped this sucker in and sat down .   from what i had read on the internet ,  and realizing the content involved in this film ,  i was expecting to test my nerves in full force .  this ended up not being the case .   the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point ,  and how long a human can tolerate pain .   sounds like one sick flick right ?  wrong .  the film fails to shock .  this may be because i have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror ,  but i think it is safe to say that any true gorehound could sit through this with ease .   on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen .  though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence .  including the ripping out of fingernails ,  intestines thrown at an unconscious woman ,  and a needle through the eye .   overall i think for majority of the gorehounds on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it ,  but i suggest that for any new comers to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one .
1	i haven't always been a fan ,  but the show grew on me .  it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show .  they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go , ould system lords were killed by rival lords ,  sg-1 or others .   towards season 5 ,  stargate sg-1 ,  was beginning to become stale .  with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise ,  the show became more and more solid .   the characters had become stale as well .  colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage .  after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o'neill's weapon ,  he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go'ould ra .  the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself .  only allowing his close friends in .   amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter .  she was a feminist on the edge ,  ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job .  though this character had little area to grow ,  tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter's strengths .  she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently .    christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal'c .  teal'c was an alien called the jaffa .  infant go'ould ,   ( snake like creatures )  would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form .  the jaffa would die .  teal'c was the first prime of apophis' army .  knowing that apophis was not a god like go'ould pretend ,  he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy .  finally ,  having had enough ,  he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people .  after arriving on earth ,  he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for ,  who would help him fight the go'ould .  christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character .  teal'c is a wise warrior ,  much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra'tac .  the show would not be complete without master bra'tac played by tony amandola .  he is also a rock .  in the end ,  he became adviser to most of sg-1 ,  especially daniel jackson .    don s .  davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand .  davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal .  he does his job ,  has a wife ,  sons and daughters and grandchildren .  you can really say ,  he is the anchor of the base .  simply ,  i would die for that man .  if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world .  he will go himself .  he doesn't leave anyone behind .   i saved dr .  daniel jackson for last ,  because this character ,  i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on .  in choosing shanks i don't think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson ,  they don't talk about spader ,  they talk about shanks .  in the early years ,  the jackson character came off as a whiner .  that's why i probably wasn't a fan .  as the seasons pasted ,  the character became stronger .  this gave him confidence .  in the end ,  as of season 10 ,  the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero .  he still monitors the groups ethics .  he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward .  acheaology ,  history ,  culture and exploration are part of his very being .  he is determined .  though a man of peace ,  he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement .    other characters include ,  most recently :  vala mal doran ( claudia black )  and colonel cameron mitchell ( ben browder )  ,  new lead of sg-1 .  both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess .  i see little difference between mitchell and crichton  ( farscape character )  .  black's character is simply off the wall .  definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon .
1	guinea pig :  the devil's experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view ,  its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature .  this movie gets right to the point ,  you may be thinking what point ?  the point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore .  this movie has some gore ,  more or less just torturing a women violently .  there are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore .  i'll tell you one thing though guinea pig :  the devil's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street .  if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen guinea pig :  the devil's experiment .   movie rating 0-5 ,  gore 0-10  guinea pig :  the devil's experiment  ( uncut )  *****  ( 7 )
1	i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie .  .  .  i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best .   even though ive seen the  " making of "  ,  i still have doubts when watching those 35mins of pure torture  :  its that powerful .   a 10 out of 10 because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do  :  be the best fake snuff film ever made .
1	after having watched  " guinea pig "  ,  two questions come in mind  (  besides 'am i really a psychopath to watch that  ? '  )   :  'is it a snuff  ? ' the answer is no  ;  although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie i've ever seen .  and then  :  'where the hell have they found that girl  ? ' .  because she gets tortured for '45 min ,  without any reasons given  (  in fact ,  there is nothing else in this movie  !  )   :  fingernails teared off ,  beaten with hands ,  feet ,  tools ,  infested by maggots ,   .  .  .  and many more until the final scene  (  i'm still not sure how they did that  )  .  because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' ,  it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money .  so what were her  (  their  )  motivations  ?   i saw it in japonese without subtitles ,  but it's not a problem  (  no real dialogues ,  the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes  )  .  i haven't seen yet all the serial ,  but the first  " guinea pig "  is not known for being the best one .  still i've rated 8 ,  because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff ,  the issue is quite good  (  ask charlie sheen ,  the actor  )  .  but i think they could have gone further ,  which they did in the following ones .   another movie i'm hiding from my parents .   8/10
1	this movie has no story .  it's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death .    !  !  ! spoilers !  !  !   this is what they do :  they beat her ,  put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood ,  spin her around on a chair until she pukes ,  expose her to loud noise ,  pour boiling oil on her ,  put worms in her sores ,  crush her hand with a sledge-hammer and finally pokes a needle through her eye .   this movie was so realistic that if i didn't know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff-movie .  although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it .  it scared me .  i guess it fills some kind of purpose .  i give it a 10/10 .
1	i have seen the short movie a few years ago .  after that i watch all sequels .  the first one is really not the best - but it's the most popular one .  i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1 .  it's really great what these guys did .  also the sequels are excellent in the special effects .  take your chance to watch it !
1	this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best .  at the same time ,  it looks realistic and unrealistic ,  just knowing that the movie is fake .  the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways .  a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address ,  and it includes a manga video ,  showing the torture .  the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die .  some scenes are shocking ,  such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times ,  because you see punches in nearly every movie .  this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older .   9/10
1	the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape ,  complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame .  it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her .  the hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers ,  her hand smashed with a hammer ,  her eye punctured with a needle ,  and so forth .   in the most nauseating scene ,  the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns .  the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen ,  believing the series to contain actual murder ,  attempted to ban its distribution in the united states .  an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re-creations using nasty ,  but obvious special effects .  gruesomely staged by acclaimed japanese comic-book artist hideshi hino ,  who also directed the third and fourth episodes ,  this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms .  but ,  gorehounds probably won't find anything special .
1	what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said ?  well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks .  how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know .  im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was .  however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real .  and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me .
1	wow ,  alot of reviews for the devils experiment are here .  wonderful .  my name is steve and i run unearthed films .  we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america .  now before you ask why am i writing a review ?  instead ask why some people bash it .  i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films .  why do i love em ,  it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go .  i've seen it all .  almost every horror film known to man ,  argento ,  fulci ,  bava ,  buttgereit .  from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster .  i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films .  why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place .  this review is for the devils experiment .  i find it devoid of story which is fine by me .  why do i watch horror films ?  so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people .  the devils experiment not only delivers but that's all it is .  pure unadulterated violence .  yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the devils experiment delivers ten fold .  why do people bash it .  cause they like a story ,  so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story .  it make em feel better about themselves .  we all want blood and gore .  it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story .  the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released .   i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world .  maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should .  my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not .  i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started unearthed films .  sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place .  the devils experiment is not for everybody .  it's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only .  if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those .  but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the devils experiment is for you .  there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years .  they are wrong ,  disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom ,  unless she is totally cool .  good luck ,  enjoy and never stop living your life .
1	my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh ,  creative and addicting .  when the cast stepped through the gate ,  you never knew what lay on the other side !  starting around season 5 ,  the show took a different focus - still good ,  but different .   the series follows the adventures of a team of humans  ( and one alien )  who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the  " stargate "  .  the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie  " stargate "  in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt .   the episodes are light  ( innocent and easy to watch )  and very creative .  many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own .  what happens next was always unpredictable .   the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed .  their tone is serious ,  but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor .  they are simply fun to watch .   starting somewhere around season 5 ,  the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe  ( the goa'uld ,  then the ori )  .  the plots become more complex  ( a lot more political/strategic oriented )  and interdependent .  the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature .   one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes .  they are simply can't-miss shows .  they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons .   if you are a sci-fi fan ,  watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll likely be hooked .  if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides ,  you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to .
1	a lot of people unfairly sh ! t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining .  devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video's vintage and low-budget .   let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know :  this film is an  " extreme "  torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid-80s .  it's plot as it stands is simple :  a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is .  this entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound .   the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground .  these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings .   the actress who plays the victim of the  " experiment "  is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera .  her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling .  some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest .  also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes .   if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot .  8 . 5/10 for devil's experiment .
1	the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . she is beaten savagely , spun around in the chair endlessly , has her finger nails pulled , animal guts are thrown at her , hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle ( really sick and nasty scene )  . the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . i have seen also  " flowers of flesh and blood "  which is more gory and sadistic , but less disturbing . anyway , this one is a must-see for horror fans !
1	first off ,  this is not supposed to be a brilliant and thought provoking film like so many other reviewers seem to compare it to .  the first review says something along the lines of anyone who likes this knows nothing about horror cinema ,  apparently its the other way around .  if one were to look back after the film it really wasn't meant to be convincing ,  it was a low budget ipecac .  but really thats all it was aiming for ,  it was meant to blow viewers away with sheer shock value  ( and all the flaws it its visuals were much less noticeable back in the original vhs versions )  .    i gave this one a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not downright horrific  ( in non-shock sense )  it did make me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid/pessimistic ( i didn't trust anyone for about a week because i didn't want to wake up strung up and tortured )
1	just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion .  every line ,  every phrase ,  every picture is exactly in place and lindsay crouse and joe mantegna are just the cool shrink and the sleazy con-man ,  so well cast .  10 out of 10 !
1	" house of games "  is a flawlessly constructed film ,  and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends .  i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review ,  which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 .  i had my doubts ,  mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year .  boy ,  was i in for a surprise .  this was one of the smartest ,  most well-written movies i had ever seen .   the screenplay is quite a piece of work ,  not only in terms of the plot  ( which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out )  ,  but also in terms of character development .  on my second viewing ,  i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film ,  but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations .  the climax of the movie is particularly effective ,  because it is absolutely inevitable .  it stems naturally from what we know about the characters ,  and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending .  the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film .  i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike ,  and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset .  their work ,  plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay ,  combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's .  it is truly a must-see .
1	just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before .  it just keeps getting better and better .  you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech ,  the slow deliberate action ,  everything being exactly in place .   truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite !  !  !
1	unique movie about confused woman  ( lindsay crouse )  who gets involved with sharp con men .  joe mantegna gives an oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group .  absolutely enchanting first hour ,  as mantegna shows crouse  " the ropes "  of his con games .  story line unravels a bit later on ,  but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world .  definitely worth a shot .
1	house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part .  a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game .   have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong ?  watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way .  sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators .  you're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie .   this is both a quality and a drawback of the script .  as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency .  but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development .   this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .
1	plenty has been written about mamet's  " the house of games "  ;  most of it good .  i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again .  the film's success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film ;  a good story and a good scam .  mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us ,  the audience ,  and the mark simultaneously .  then he explains the art of conning only to do it again ,  etc .  all the while building the story .   " the house of games "  ,  now a freebie on cable ,  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans .   ( b+ )
1	this typical mamet film delivers a quiet ,  evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man  ( joe mantegna )  good .  explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist  ( lindsay crouse )  ,  it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences .  the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet's films  ( steven goldstein ,  jack wallace ,  ricky jay ,  andy potok ,  allen soule ,  william h .  macy )  ,  and they do their usual good job .  i loved lindsay crouse in this film ,  and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become .  perhaps i'm not looking in the right places !   the movie proceeds at a slow pace ,  with flat dialog ,  yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending .  you'd expect a real let down at the ending ,  but i found it uplifting and satisfying .  i love this movie !
1	in the spirit of the classic  " the sting "  ,  this movie hits where it truly hurts .  .  .  in the heart !  a prim ,  proper female psychiatrist ,  hungry for adventure ,  meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals .  the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman ,  and begs to be involved in his operation .  while the movie moves kind of  " slow "  ,  it's climax and ending are stunning !  you'll especially enjoy how the doctor  " forgives herself "  !
1	i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 .  richard dean anderson 2 .  amanda tapping .  these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors .  the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show .   the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous .  you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling .  this relationship carries over into the program we get to see .   rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality .  he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest .  you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances .  still ,  they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous .   there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface .  they manage to keep the lid on ,  but often just barely .  the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television .  the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together .   'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill' .  yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound .  he understands what to do without having to think about the matter .  the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders .   the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10 .  the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest .  ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show .  he had his rare moments with claudia black ,  but that was all .  amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons .  you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby .  she was probably thinking more about the child than the show .   the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments ,  but is mostly a weaker effort .  the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original .  the villains  ( wraiths )  are so improbable as to be ludicrous .  maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season .   there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show .  to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi .  the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad .  the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept .   i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too .  in the season 2 opener ,  'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded .  he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet .  the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc ,  yet it is never mentioned again .  this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel' ,  'o'neill' ,  and 'dr .  frasier' .
1	a film destined to be on late-night tv long after the present instant  " money-makers "  have long been forgotten .  perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters ,  but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie .
1	this movie should not be compared to  " the sting "  ,  or other caper/heist/con game films .  what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships ,  deceit and trust .  it's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry ,  given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale .  has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy ?  highly ,  hugely recommended !
1	ask yourself where she got the gun ?  remember what she was taught about the mark's mindset when the con is over ?  the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning .   when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand .   the patient was in on the con from the beginning .   mantegna does not die in the end - the gun had blanks .   there - enough spoilers for you there ?  this is why people are giving it such high ratings .  it's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience .
1	i'm a big fan of films where people get conned ,  and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned' genre .  in short ,  it's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels ,  and never truly revealing what's happening ,  while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you've just seen .  the film cons the audience on many occasions ,  and despite us knowing this ;  it's still difficult to guess where it's going ,  and every twist comes off as a surprise .  as mentioned ,  i'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler .  she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient ,  and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con .   house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout ,  and david mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city .  the film is well acted also ,  with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill .  joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film ,  and although his performance is a little under wrought ,  he's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece .  lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work ,  and again is believable in her role .  she may not be the greatest looker ,  but at least she can act .  the way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show ,  however ,  and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer .  at times it's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film .  another thing that's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons ,  which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks ,  say .  all in all ,  house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride .
1	spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters .  but who is conning who here ?  when does the hunter turn into the prey ?  this gritty ,  dark movie is slow moving and seductive .  it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path ,  only to waylay you just as you think you are safe .   it has a riveting script ,  with good acting  ( at least from the leads )  .  i didn't notice the background music ,  but it was never jarring ,  so it must have been done right .   i was very surprised that i liked this movie ,  because i don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end .
1	get ready for it :  this is one of my favourite films of all time .  i am relatively unaware of david mamet's  ( writer and director )  other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times ( it's always a joy to watch )  ,  i can say without hesitation that he is a genius .  this film is extremely well written ,  and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit ,  con-artistry and back room hustles .  the feel of the film is very similar to the sting  ( 1973 )  and it also pays homage to film noir .   it's quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters .  it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch .   generally ,  the acting is superb- especially joe mantegna- but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that it's not a good idea to have a heroine  ( lindsay crouse )  who is not only a gambler ,  a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80's hairdo .  i agree ,  but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role .   the less you know about the plot of this film ,  the better ,  just like mamet's most recent film ,  the spanish prisoner ,  because the ending will be even more impressive .  just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance .
1	opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama .  all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener  ( and the performer )  intrigued and entertained applies to this film .  there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad .  mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor .  if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended ?  as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .
1	this is very nearly a perfect film .  the ideas would be repeated by mamet ,  but never told so succinctly .  this is really about the failure of trust ,  of the human condition .  the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals ,  no one is innocent .  is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society ,  every single day ?  the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller .  except ,  there are no more innocent characters .  the world is now completely polluted ,  ruined and everyone is participating in the con .  could anything be more true ?   don't miss the soundtrack .  it is wonderful .
1	" house of games "  is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes ,  stiff acting ,  final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head .   " house of games "  does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do .  of course ,  this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate .  so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on ,  even though we think that we do .  but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game ;  a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities .   it has a definite hitchcock slant to it .  the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort  " marnie "  ,  considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master's more thought-provoking works .  one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse's character being the same as tippi hedrin's .  .  . ten year later perhaps .  both are strong-willed loners ,  both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool .  as crouse's repressed ,  up-tight character says ,   " what's life without adventure ?  "  put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks !
1	i'm not great at writing reviews ,  so i'll just spout my opinions .  .  .   i loved this series at first .  the adventure ,  the action ,  the comedy ,  the drama .  .  .  i thought it was all brilliant .  anderson ,  tapping ,  shanks ,  judge ,  davis .  .  .  i loved them all .  davis ,  it seemed ,  was the fifth-most important person in the cast .  not a big deal .  but when his character  ( general hammond )  left at the end of the seventh season ,  and anderson's character  ( colonel o'neill )  moved from the field to the office ,  the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff .  i don't know whether it's because hammond was more important that i realized or what ,  but for some reason ,  after the seventh season ,  the series turned to **** .   the first seven seasons ,  though ,  were awesome .  the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it ,  but it turned out to be ,  even if this wasn't the original intention ,  a brilliant setup to the series .  i recommend that you watch the movie first ,  then watch the first season of the tv series ,  then watch the movie again  ( you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around ,  believe me )  ,  and then watch the rest of the tv series .   the last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven ,  but that doesn't mean they aren't good .  it just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons .   after you have finished this series ,  be sure to watch the spin off series ,  stargate :  atlantis .  it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series .   edit on 7-18-08 :  i just found out that don s .  davis died a few weeks ago .  it is a great loss .
1	wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients .  a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better .  here she gets involved with joe mantegna .  to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'house of games' may very well be the best con movie i've seen .  david mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue ,  great one-liners ,  and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end .  crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man .  and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie ,  the film is in utter control of it's audience ;  and we are loving the con .   *** out of ****
1	house of games is spell binding .  it's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens .  there are few movies i've seen that can grip you so quickly .  from the opening scene this movie just gets you .   i'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don't read anymore if you don't want to know .   i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen-bar none .  from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed .   lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection ,  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately .  joe mantegna was also wonderful .  the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices .  i also loved the way the movie was filmed ,  in that grainy ,  surreal type of way ,  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was .   there were a few movies i've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really ,  house of games is completely different in it's way .  margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet ,  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying .  you know something's going to happen but you have no idea what .  and just when you think you've guessed what the  " something "  is ,  you realize you haven't even scratched the surface .  .  .  .   house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature .  the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well .  as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters ,  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it .  it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it's conclusion .   in closing ,  i'd rank this 10 of 10 ,  call it  ( although not my absolute favorite film ,  pretty high on the list )  ,  most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  " twists "  i've ever seen as well .  although i love all types and genres of movies ,  when it comes to movies of the human psyche ,  it really doesn't get much better then this .  see this movie .
1	i have to say ,  from the beginning ,  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie ,  with a lot of potential ,  though the movie wasn't as ,  erm ,  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens ,  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing ,  even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people ,  i don't remember one line from either of those movies ,  i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts ,  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you ,  ah getting slightly off the point here ,  well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series ,  which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end ,  in 2006 .   though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 ,  and let me tell you ,  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series ,  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects ,  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today .  i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate ,  and my dad ,  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 ,  and i'm glad he did ,  other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1 ,  which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies ,  basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as sg1 ,  its not worth watching .  basically this is the best sci fi show to date ,  and if you don't watch this ,  then you have no idea what you are missing !
1	here's my first david mamet directed film .  fitting ,  since it was his first ,  as well .    the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie ,  from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con .  it's like  " the grifters ,  "  but without that film's level of acting .   ( in that film ,  john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character .  )  the acting here is very flat  ( i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis )  .  at least in the beginning .  it never gets really good ,  but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes .  early in the film ,  some of lindsay crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration ,  which they aren't .  with the arrival of mantegna things pick up .   the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be .  i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue ,  but these ones don't .  it all sounds very read ,  rather than spoken .  maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up ,  but if not ,  then maybe he should let others direct his words .  he's far too precious with them here and as a result ,  they lose their rhythmic ,  jazzy quality .  what's more strange is that other than this ,  the film doesn't look or feel like a play .  the camera is very cinematic .  my only problem with  " glengarry glen ross "  was that it looked too much like filmed theatre ,  but in that film the actors were not only accomplished ,  but relaxed and free .  everything flowed .   i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie  ( or even book )  characters speaking play lines .  it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work .  that doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't ,  it's often extremely entertaining .  the best chunk is in the middle .   it's standard con movie stuff :  the new guy  ( in this case ,  girl )  margaret ford  ( lindsay crouse )  gets involved in the seedy con underworld .  how she gets involved is :  she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients ,  billy is a compulsive gambler .  she wants to help him out with his gambling debt ,  so she walks into the house of games ,  a dingy game room where con men work in a back room .  i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable .   ( were they just expecting crouse to come in ?  were they expecting she'd write a cheque ?  was billy in on it ?  one of these questions is definitely answered by the end ,  however .  )   and from here the cons are start to roll out .  i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun .  we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is .    we see the ending coming ,  and then we didn't see the second ending coming ,  and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did .  the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling .   i'm going to forgive the annoying opening ,  the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here .  if the first part of the movie seems stagy ,  stick with it .  after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going .  if you want a fun con movie ,  then here she is .  if you want mamet ,  go watch  " glengarry glen ross "  again -- james foley did him better .   ***
1	if your idea of a thriller is car chases ,  explosions ,  and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire ,  then  " house of games "  is definitely not the movie for you .  if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense ,  then ,  by all means ,  see it .    " house of games "  tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer ,  dr .  margaret ford  ( lindsay crouse )  ,  who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike  ( joe mantegna )  .  to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense .  frankly ,  i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming .  just like a clever con artist ,  this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance .   the story is taut and well-crafted ,  the dialogue smart and laconic ,  the acting uniformly good  ( mantegna is superbly charismatic )  .  some have complained that dr .  ford is not a very sympathetic character ,  and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive .  but dr .  ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ;  moreover ,  her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot  ( at one point ,  i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation  .  .  .  i'll say no more )  .    " house of games "  is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity .  it will hold your attention every second while you are watching ,  and stay with you for a long time afterwards .
1	house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels .  it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller .  it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna ,  and a strong ,  strong cast of supporting players ,  and it introduces ricky jay ,  card sharp extraordinaire ,  prestidigitator and historian of magic .  its dialogue ,  written by david mamet ,  is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie  ( in which reality is often in question )  an extra dimension of unrealness .   on the face of it ,  house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men ,  diametrically different from the sting ,  which was played merely for glamour and yuks .  at this level it does succeed admirably .   however ,  you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization .  the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin .  that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus ,  hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs .  house of games sticks to its business .  as poe once said of a good short story ,  it drives relentlessly to its conclusion .   there is another strain of movies-about-women ,  epitomized by thelma and louise ,  a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed ,  whether or not they realize their inner strengths .  what tripe .   as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater .  it should be a natural for film festivals .  nominate it for one near you if you get the chance .   i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter .  better she should see it on a tv than not at all .
1	`the united states of kiss my ass'  house of games is the directional debut from playwright david mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller .  it stars lindsay crouse as best-selling psychiatrist ,  margaret ford ,  who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide .  in doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place ,  house of games .   the gambler mike  ( played excellently by joe mantegna )  turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty .  he offers crouse's character a deal ,  if she is willing to sit with him at a game ,  a big money game in the backroom ,  he'll cancel the patients debts .  the card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work  ( gaining the trust of others )  and a fascinating relationship begins .  what makes house of games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control ,  is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs david mamet .   in house of games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring ,  however in every david mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings ,  not the direction .  in house of games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads  ( showy and distracting )  but mainly as is the case with much of mamet's work ,  it is the dialogue ,  which grips you and slowly draws you into the film .  no one in the house of games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words .  everyone bluffs and double bluffs ,  which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order .  this is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension .  house of games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie .  with lindsay crouse we have the middle-class ,  well-to-do educated psychiatrist and joe mantegna is the complete opposite ,  the working class of america earning a living by `honest' crime .   the film seduces the viewer much like crouse is seduced by mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of american cinema .  and the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for ,  it's stunning .   an extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings .  9/10
1	david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `house of games , ' a character study fraught with psychological overtones ,  in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game .  margaret ford  ( lindsay crouse )  has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel ,  'driven . ' still ,  she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life ;  there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve ,  and it primes her vulnerability .  when a patient ,  billy hahn  ( steven goldstein )  ,  confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers ,  and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay ,  she decides to intervene on his behalf .  this takes her to the `house of games , ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike  ( joe mantegna )  ,  a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world .  instead of the `twenty-five large' that billy claimed he owed ,  mike shows her his book ,  and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars .  and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean ,  if she'll agree to do him one simple favor ,  which involves a card game he has going on in the back room .  in the middle of a big hand ,  mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes ;  while he is gone ,  her job is to watch for the `tell' of one of the other players .  by this time ,  not only margaret ,  but the audience ,  as well ,  is hooked .  the dialogue ,  and mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines ,  is mesmerizing .  as mike leads margaret through his compelling ,  surreal realm of existence ,  and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game ,  we are swept right along with her .  from that first memorable encounter ,  when he demonstrates what a `tell' is and how it works ,  to the lessons of the `short con , ' to the stunning climax of this film ,  mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless .  and nothing is what it seems .  in the end ,  margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature ,  and about herself .  she changes ;  and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation .  mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film ;  he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows ,  and does .  crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here ;  you feel the rigid ,  up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm ,  self-assured exterior ,  and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her ,  she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated .  she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does ,  and makes you understand it ,  as well .  the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum  ( joey )  ,  lilia skala  ( dr .  littauer )  ,  j . t .  walsh  ( the businessman )  ,  ricky jay  ( george )  and william h .  macy  ( sergeant moran )  .  `house of games' is the quintessential mamet ;  he's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since ,  and will no doubt grace us with more in the future .  but this film will be the one that defines him ;  and you can go to the dictionary and look it up .  you'll find it under `perfection . ' this is one great movie you do not want to miss .  i rate this one 10/10 .
1	this movie is amazing !  while being funny and entertaining ,  it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening .  i will watch it again and again .  bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life .  he has a job and a life ,  but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness .  bruce is bitter ,  unsatisfied ,  and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be .  as a result of this state of mind ,  bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life .  god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers .  bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted .  his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy .  .  .  .  . with one exception .  in the process of gaining everything ,  he loses the one person who truly loved him .  as the movie unfolds ,  bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances ,  but his perception of what was truly there .  this movie was inspirational and deep .  if you really pay attention ,  it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize .  as my wife says ,   " since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy ?  "  and my humble addition ,   " may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out .  "
1	this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for .  if you watch t . v .  ,  then you might as well not watch the movie .  almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews ,  except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one .  it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny .  just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised .  all in all ,  if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must-see ,  otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied .
1	i absolutely loved this movie .  it met all expectations and went beyond that .  i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly .  it also had a message .  jim carrey makes me happy .   :  )
1	wow ,  finally jim carrey has returned from the died .  this movie had me laughing and crying .  it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from .  jeniffer aniston was great ,  she will finally have a hit movie under her belt .  if you liked liar liar you will love this movie .  i give it 9/10 .
1	bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show ,  and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent  " hey hollywood - look how good i can act !  "  box office disappointments .  it's great to see jim recognizing and embracing his strengths .  he won't get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the  " awarded films "  of the academy .  he is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend .   carrey ,  freeman ,  and aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles ,  superb comic timing ,  and obviously having fun together but without the  " hey mom - look how funny i am "  type of comedy .  a real surprise was steven carrell as carrey's nemesis  ( carrell of the daily show fame )  ,  who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film .  i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years .   i can foresee the religious nuts in the us will be up-in-arms over the treatment of god ,  but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will .  without married with children t o complain about ,  this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities  ( who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on sunday morning and late nigh television ,  selling prayers to god )  .  and ,  again ,  about 0 . 5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it .   the bottom line :  this a purely entertaining film ,  each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do ,  and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion .  a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor .  what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry .   thanks again ,  jim -- it's great to have you back !  !
1	after a slow beginning ,  bruce almighty is a very funny film that had something positive to say .  it wasn't one of jim carrey's best performances ,  but he was still ok .  morgan freeman was just right as god .  jennifer aniston had some good moments .  i miss steve correll on  " the daily show !  "   i like director tom shadyac's choices of movies .  he also did liar liar ,  patch adams ,  and the nutty professor .  in all three of those and in bruce almighty ,  he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him .  a director who knows comedy ,  can get the talent he gets ,  and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find .   my biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references .  i only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie .  my guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references ,  but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people .  that's too bad because i thought it was a missed opportunity .   my grade :   7 out of 10
1	let me start out by saying i'm a big carrey fan .  although i'll admit i haven't seen all of his movies *cough*the magestic*cough* .  bruce almighty was enjoyable .  none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end ,  i dont know what the writers were thinking .  somehow i couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating liar liar .   on a positive note ,  the daily show's steve correl is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast .  see bruce almighty if you're a big jim carrey fan ,  or if you just want to see a light-hearted  ( que soft piano music )  somewhat funny comedy .
1	`bruce almighty' will sweep the academy awards with a record 14 oscar wins !  it will surpass `titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time !  jim carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 white house playoffs .  almighty then !  these grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers  ( carrey included )  would possess the powers of god .  that very same premise is the paramount ingredient in carrey's new laugh riot `bruce almighty' .  carrey plays bruce nolan ,  a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total culpability for his own contretemps .  god ,  heavenly played by morgan freeman ,  grants bruce the `gift of god' ( his powers )  in order to challenge him if he can do god's job any better .  obviously ,  bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly .  carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `bruce almighty' .  jennifer aniston was not `mis . pittiful' as bruce's girlfriend .  however ,  my premier kudos goes to director tom shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2 ,  and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time !  `bruce almighty' is not the most in-depth carrey film ,  but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `carreyism' !  **** good
1	jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season  ( late may )  and a good improvement on carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies .  with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self ,  carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic ,  tearfully somber moments .  elements of jim's real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie .  this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons ,  including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script .  while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama ,  bruce ,  almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste .  eight out of ten stars .
1	ok ,  so it's not a masterpiece like the godfather ,  but it doesn't have to be .  the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times .  if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times ,  it has accomplished its purpose .  i laughed out loud and left with a smile .  i feel like i got my money's worth .
1	fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc .  carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time ,  and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting .  the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast  ( including morgan freeman as  " god "  )  is great and makes the film worth catching .  grade :  b
1	well not actually .  this movie is very entertaining though .  went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the  " i think there might be something in my eye "  routine .  the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance .  jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides .  in fact all the characters are great .  the movie is not overly funny or sappy ,  good flick to go see with the wife .   all in all 8/10 .  .  .  . note * i am not an easy grader .  thats all from bigv over and out !
1	i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal .  his character is like all of us .  wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver .   morgan freeman made a great god .  with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself .   i thought jennifer aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry's basically self-centered tv anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written .   i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened .   i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep .  this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart .   a funny film .
1	i am a very big jim carrey fan .  i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura .  i also like him in his serious movies ,  especially truman show .  this one is a cross between his very funny side ,  and his serious side .  he is of course very funny in this movie ,  but there are parts that are very serious ,  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease .  he is truely a multi-function actor .   as for the rest of the cast ,  i was happy with jennifer aniston's acting .  i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass .  morgan freeman makes a very cool god .  as for steven carell ,  his limited scenes are very funny ,  especially in the anchor scene .   overall ,  i would have to rate this a 9 .  good acting ,  funny script ,  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .
1	i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 !    the final episode of the 10th season  " unending "  ,  where  ( it would certainly appear that )  the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed ,  unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion ,  left me in disbelief !    from the extremely rushed end of the series ,  it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season .  my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves !   unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie  ( with a very good explanation of the  " apparent "  extinction )  ,  i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends !   poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series .
1	a very funny movie .  it was good to see jim carrey back in top form .  it was definitely worth the price of admission .  morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film .  i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however ,  still a good film to see .
1	i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made .  both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series ,  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters .  if you look at the original star trek and star trek : tng ,  they were fine shows ,  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes .  in many ways ,  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring .  this was less the case with deep space 9  ( with its giant battles that took up all of the final season )  and the other trek shows ,  as there was more of a larger story that unified them .  this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1 .  the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form .  sure ,  there were a few  " throwaway "  episodes that were not connected to the rest ,  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .   and speaking of funny ,  i loved that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious .  in this way ,  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5 .  jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .   to truly appreciate sg-1 ,  you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work .  this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power .  and ,  if you don't like sg-1 after giving it a fair chance ,  then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you .
1	bruce almighty ,  one of carrey's best pictures since .  .  .  well .  .  .  a long time .  it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too .  .  .  morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny .  it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes .  the best scene in ,  it is where jim is messing up the anchor man's voice .   my rating :  8/10
1	this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made .  carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film .  he was both funny and sad .  carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan .  nolan blames god ( morgan freeman )  for everything that goes wrong in his life .  then ,  god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers .  as i said before ,  carrey did an excellent job .  i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor/actress .  the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point .  this movie can be funny ( bruce's dog )  as well as sad ( the  " break-up "  )  .  the script worked well ,  too .  i am glad they made a sequel to this film .  i rate this film a 9/10 .
1	bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan ,  an average man who feels god is messing up his life .  god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways .  of course ,  giving someone god's powers could take a turn for the worse .  bruce almighty is a good comedy ,  jim carrey is good ,  as always morgan freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well .  the jokes are almost always on target ,  although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey's facial expressions .  i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god ,  not only that but also as a black man .  i thought this quite well ,  especially with the brilliant freeman .  there are some hilarious scenes ,  the opening cookie scene for instance ,  others miss the target slightly but still a good film .  6/7 out of 10
1	" bruce almighty "  looks and sounds incredibly stupid ,  especially from the trailers .  nevertheless ,  i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more .  bruce  ( jim carrey )  is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job .  morgan freeman plays a man symbolized here as god ,  and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles ,  he does excellent with what he is given to work with .  although crude at times ,  the film does have quite a few laughs ,  from bruce parting his soup in half like the red sea and the customers' reactions to him ,  as well as freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of god .  it is overly exaggerated at times ,  and there is some crude humor ,  but overall it manages to be somewhat funny .  there is a decent supporting cast ,  such as jennifer aniston ,  lisa ann walter ,  and steve carrell ,  which always helps .  the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking ,  and the message is clear ,  that we should do what god has called us to do and  " be the miracle .  "  the film is far from perfect ,  but still enjoyable ,  and far better than i and many people probably would have expected ,  especially if we see the deeper message of the film .   *** out of ****
1	if you want a serious laugh pain ,  watch this movie ,  and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster .  the deleted scenes are priceless .  i don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie .  it can't be because of time ,  since the movie is only 101 minutes long .  morgan freeman is a brilliant actor ,  who has been overlooked for too long .  jim carrey needs meds !
1	as someone who lives near buffalo ,  new york ,  this movie scored points with me before i even saw it ,  since the story is based here .  there are even some bit parts with real-life news-tv anchor people from buffalo .  . and ,  for once ,  it doesn't knock the area .  hallelujah !   theology-wise ,  puh-leeze !  !  !  god is still made to look and think like humans .  .  . and ,  of course ,  be a bit on the liberal side .  being the lightweight comedy it is ,  it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes .    there are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and ,  hopefully ,  audiences - from christians to atheists . - got something out of this besides a few laughs ,  such as what prayer should really be all about .  kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message .   overall ,  it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few .
1	i really do not know what people have against this film ,  but it's definitely one of my favourites .  it's not preachy ,  it's not anchored by it's moral ,  it shouldn't be controversial .  it's just god .  any possible god ,  no matter the religion .  and it's really funny .   jim carry plays bruce nolan ,  a tv reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news ,  desperate to prove himself  ( more or less to himself )  that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job .  this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace  ( jennifer aniston )  away .  when the final straws are executed ,  he's quick to not laugh ,  but yell in the face of god ,  who in turn gives bruce his powers .  bruce then makes his life better for himself ,  until he's guilted into helping others ,  where he then continues to miss the point of his powers .  meanwhile ,  his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish ,  leaving his relationship on dangerous ground .   ok ,  that was kinda long .  but as a plot ,  it works well .  the step-by-step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being god is much better than clustering his problems together ,  and is able to hide itself fairly well .   as you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place ,  carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character  ( which ,  luckily enough ,  is him )  ,  and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene .  whether they would admit it or not ,  the role was written or rewritten exclusively for carrey .  without him ,  the humour would turn flat ,  as humour is half execution .  and the humour is very good in the first place .  but without carrey ,  it would kinda feel like a it's a wonderful life wannabe .   jennifer aniston is great and ,  no matter what some may say ,  does not act like the only excuse for the third act .  at least ,  you don't think that when you see her .  she gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie ,  she and carrey feel very much like a real couple .   the movie feels ggooooodd  ( see the movie to understand )  ,  has a very nice feeling ,  tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save carrey's career  ( which wasn't goin' anywhere .  )  .
1	well ,  was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns ?  this film sure was better than that bore ,   " oh ,  god "  .  i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through .  carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe ,  and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance .  i ,  for one ,  don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented .  i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history .  see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor :  i was rolling over this one .  well written and even better played out ,  this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best .
1	now either you like mr carrey's humour or you don't .  me ,  myself and irene had audiences both walking out in droves and ,  on the other hand ,  cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth .  bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream ,  but you have been warned .   if you're not sure ,  watch the trailer .  i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film .  if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny ,  don't bother with the movie .   carrey ,  a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot .  god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better .  carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend  ( jennifer aniston ) 's breasts bigger ,  getting himself promoted ,  and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands .   this is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable ,  but it is very well made within it's very limited intent ,  provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans ,  and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders .   on the more thoughtful level ,  the film tempts us to speculate about carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden globes .  his most accomplished 'straight' role ,  the man on the moon ,  is less well known that his comedy romps - or the truman show  ( on which the academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing carrey )  .
1	starring :  jim carrey ,  morgan freeman ,  jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie .  i mean ,  what a conceptual nightmare .  jim carrey playing god ?  nothing is sacred anymore .   well ,  this movie is hardly sacred ,  but it also is not sacrilegious ,  at least not to any great extent .  yes ,  jim carrey has the powers of god for a while ,  but he is not god .  confused ?  i'll give you the low down .   jim carrey plays bruce nolan ,  a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life .  he lives with his beautiful girlfriend ,  grace  ( anniston )  ,  and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other ,  but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground .   then bruce gets a shot at anchorman ,  only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter .  obviously not please ,  bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired .   much complaining and griping about god later ,  bruce gets a page .  after a while he gets tired of it calling ,  so he responds and goes to the omni presents building  ( heh )  .  there he meets god  ( freeman )  ,  who is the boss ,  electrician ,  and janitor of the building .  i found this highly amusing .  god is the boss ,  the holy spirit is the electrician ,  and jesus christ is the janitor .  think about it .  boss ,  obvious .  electrician ,  the guy who keeps everything running .  janitor ,  the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left .  brilliant .   anyway ,  bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god ,  but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god ,  he starts to believe a bit .  wonder why .  enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies .   since this is hollywood ,  bruce obviously eventually smartens up ,  learns his lesson ,  and starts using his powers for the good of the world .  in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done ,  not bruce's .   since it is jim carrey ,  the movie is quite amusing ,  and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it .  the movie is not perfect theology ,  but for hollywood ,  it is definitely a good attempt .  many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging ,  and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie .   so ,  while far from perfect ,  definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it .   bottom line :  3 . 5 out of 4  ( worth a view or two )
1	this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate .  it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention .  such as ,  how was the stargate activated without a human computer ?  where did the goa'uld  ( ra's race )  come from ?  how many are there ?    the first episode has a retired jack o'neill  ( spelled with 2 ls )  recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis ,  a powerful goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman .  we meet samantha carter ,  a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time ,  and is determined to go through now .  we find out that daniel got married on abydos ,  and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial .  then daniel's wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen .    it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams ,  in which jack's team will be sg-1 which consists of jack ,  samantha and daniel .  they go to chulak ,  a goa'uld homeworld to rescue daniel's wife and another one captured at abydos named ska'ra .  they get captured ,  and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners ,  a jaffa named teal'c ,  first prime of apophis ,  saves them and goes to earth with them ,  where he is made part of sg-1 .    that was only the beginning of the adventure .  in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future ,  gotten transported to alternate realities ,  swapped bodies ,  grown old ,  met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa'uld called the tok'ra ,  in which samantha's dad becomes a member ,  the asgard ,  a cute little race in which we see thor most often  ( he's jack's buddy )  , and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times .   the show was recently canceled ,  but lasted ten seasons .  in season nine ,  a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers ,  new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators ,  the ancients .  season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters ,  ben browder as cameron mitchell ,  the new leader of sg-1 and claudia black as vala maldoran ,  a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team .    very well-produced ,  interesting characters ,  fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack ,  this one has it all .  a different way of travelling the galaxy ,  and different kinds of adventures ,  this is one show you don't want to miss .  unlock the gate and step through .  you won't regret it !
1	jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask ,  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck .  even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  ( and of course they have to be mexican ,  obviously )  ,  his good will towards his fellow man backfires .  in that case ,  it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums ,  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored .  i'm reminded of the episode of michael moore's brilliant the awful truth ,  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay .  the results were not very promising ,  so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan ,  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart .  or even better ,  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  ( a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film )  .  bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie .  he's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station ,  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague .  you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report .  needless to say ,  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself ,  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman's massive talent as an actor .  he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously ,  but in such a way as to advise his followers  ( as well as the viewers of this movie )  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life .  i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day .  there are a lot of people in the world  ( maybe more than our share in america )  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives ,  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion .  i ,  for example ,  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live .  but despite the fact that i don't believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time ,  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .   jim carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come .  if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  ( both of which i loved ,  by the way )  or a lot of what he did before he got into film ,  it's amazing how far he's come .  he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show ,  man on the moon ,  and the majestic  ( easily one of his greatest films ever )  .  jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  ( as she did in the side-splitting office space )  as bruce's girlfriend ,  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him .  there is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery ,  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene ,  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura's friend spike make a cameo appearance .  as stephen king very well knows ,  it's always nice to see familiar characters .  it's almost like seeing family again .   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better ,  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him .  the thing i love about this is that ,  like i said before ,  religion is absent from my life ,  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers .  the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way ,  which empowers the message even more .   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film ,  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position ,  the jimmy hoffa scene  ( who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records )  ,  the scene where bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera ,  and my favorites ,  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking .  the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes ,  such as when he says to god  ( who reveals that he's the janitor ,  the proprietor ,  the electrician ,  etc )  that his christmas parties must be real bashes ,  and to be careful about drinking ,  because on of him might need a ride home !  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes .  a little too true ,  and as gallagher would add ,  behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law .   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while ,  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection .  it is a comedy written and performed in good taste ,  but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained .  this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family ,  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days .  in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  ( which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy )  ,  it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching .  don't miss this one .
1	as long as you go into this movie knowing that it's terrible :  bad acting ,  bad  " effects ,  "  bad story ,  bad .  .  .  everything ,  then you'll love it .  this is one of my favorite  " goof on "  movies ;  watch it as a comedy and have a dozen good laughs !
1	china o'brien  ( 1990 )  was an attempt to make cynthia rothrock a star in the united states .  this golden harvet production was helmed by veteran director robert clouse .  sadly he was either lucky with enter the dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director .  the only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of ms .  rothrock and richard norton .  if this movie was directed by corey yuen or hoi meng it could have been an action classic instead of a cheesy straight-to-video action flick .   china o'brien returns home to help out her dad .  he's having trouble with the local mob and he needs her help .  so she returns home and restores order  ( with the help of two unlikely people )  .  but will they be enough to topple mister big and his evil cronies ?   if you're a big cynthia rothrock fan then this movie's catered for you .  i only enjoyed the fighting scenes ,  everything else is rubbish .  why didn't raymond chow shell out a few shekels and hired a top notch action director ?   recommended .
1	this one and  " her pilgrim soul "  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone .  as i mentioned in my comment on the new series ,  there's something lacking in this new series .  maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned .  it's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling's version .  however ,  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too .  i think the appeal is that no matter what they do ,  the lovers can never unite .  i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie  " il mare "   ( later remade into  " the lake house "  .  i think it's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .
1	this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories  ( i note both of them are based on short stories )  .   " examination day "  is set in the future ,  year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves ,  huge tv-looking  " phones "  that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age .  .  . and the examination day ,  a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required iq test .  the kid is this story ,  dickie jordan  ( david mendenhall )  is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid ,  so is calm ,  even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades .  his parents  ( christopher allport and elizabeth norment )  ,  on the other hand ,  say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score ,  and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry ,  it's pretty obvious they are worried .  i won't give anything away in the ending ,  but i will say this - there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject :  that evening  ( or another ?  )  his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night .  by today's standards ,  we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching .  .  . but why would his family ask this ?  the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon  ( which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen )  .  i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was .  i found it to be better than the short story it was based on .  i haven't read the one that  " a message from charity "  was based on ,  but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy ,  peter  ( robert duncan mcneill )  is suffering a fever from unclean water ,  that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown .  .  . but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever ,  charity payne ,   ( kerry noonann )  who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him .  they both recover ,  especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985 ,  but the connection doesn't go away .  charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company ,  especially peter ,  who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students ,  even at the college he's been staying in one place at .  things take an unexpected turn ,  though ,  when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment ,  added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever  ( not so common in 1700 )  .  the two try to learn a way to save her .  the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching .  both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times ,  through a lesson/warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment ,  make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship ,  love ,  and wisdom do a great deal .  probably 3/4 of this has no theme ,  but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew .
1	remember these two stories fondly and in the first ,  set in the not too distant future ,  we see a young boy preparing for examination day ,  the state i . q test .  the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test .  upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why .  the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth .  the boy then asks ,  puzzled again ,  why wouldn't he ?  it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry ,  but their son's i . q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial .  a corker of a concluding scene !  a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present .  which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present .  a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion .
1	you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies ,  even the really bad ones ?  why ?  to see their heroes in action one more time .  that's the way i feel about doc savage .  i am a major fanatic for the character ,  and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming .  and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation .  then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie ,  resulting in a somewhat disjointed film .  there's a lot of promise in here ,  diluted by a number of unfortunate choices  ( the music ,  the  " camp "  elements ,  etc .  )  but the spirit of doc is there ,  and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to .  so ,  in my long-winded way ,  what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie :  it's just not as good as it should have been .  and anyone who is a fan of superman ,  james bond ,  indiana jones ,  buckaroo banzai ,  and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .
1	it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression .  it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace .  a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball .   likewise ,  an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema .  the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and  ( especially )  comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality .   the literature of the time also flourished at all levels .  the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it ,  what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures .  but the comic book just did not magically appear ,  all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages ,  all by itself .  there were mediums that were ancestral to them .  obviously , the newspaper comic strip was one parent ,  providing the visual/narrative method of story telling .   the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine .  the inexpensive ,  prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going ,  though not necessarily serialized ,  tales .  the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro .  the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow ,  the avenger ,  g8's battle aces and the spider , master of men all found their way to the news stands ,  among many others .   one other was doc savage ,  a full-blooded super hero of the written story ;  the covers of the pulps had perhaps ,  the only  " picture "  of the hero .  possessing extraordinary strength ,  super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect ,  doc was the prototype super hero .   he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small ,  free lancing team of adventurers .  each of them was an expert in a given field .  so we had a top rated :  chemist ,  lawyer ,  construction engineer ,  electrical engineer ,  geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist ,  etc .   the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's ,  and were published into the middle '50's .  then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years .  then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new  " container "  ,  the paperback book .  a fresh look to the cover art was introduced ,  featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc ,  with a perpetually ripped shirt .   the re-introduction proved to be highly successful ,  with the publication of a title a month  ( and for a while more )  .  soon ,  there was a rumor of a doc savage movie !  but when ,  by what producer ?  well ,  the venerable  " man of bronze "  was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together .  it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films ,  geoprge pal ,  who did the film along with warner brothers .   when doc savage ,  man of bronze arrived in the movie houses ,  it boasted of a well casted team of actors ,  albeit a largely  " no name "  as far familiarity with the viewers .  with former tarzan of tv , ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead ,  up and coming beauty of a starlette ,  pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler  ( as the villainous ,  captain seas )  ;  no other name would have been recognized .  and ,  just maybe that was a plus in this case .   the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going .  use of narration ,  by paul frees ,  and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story .   from the very start ,  there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured  " camp "  humor as the batman tv series .  some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected ,  unlikely outcomes .   ( for example ,  an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish ,  a small one at that .  )  the whole story unfolds like that ,  hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often ,  as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously .  we are also puzzled about mr .  george pal's being the producer ( his last )  .  he who had been so well known for special effects ,  surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character's world .   i can remember seeing it quite vividly .  mrs .  ryan  ( deanna )  was in the hospital ,  just having given birth to our 2nd child ,  michelle ( 08/14/75 )  .  our older girl ,  jennifer ,  was visiting her grandmother ,  so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward ,  it was straight over to the old marquette theatre ,  63rd & kedzie ,  here in chicago .   having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc ,  i was sort of let down by the final product .  i could accept a little of this 'camp' business ,  but would not have objected if mr . pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement .   and yet ,  the cast ,  headed-up by mr .  ely and the others ,  made the whole film likable ,  if not lovable .  the sets and locations were ,  as far as we can see ,  very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone .   and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage ,  man of bronze .
1	having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based .  upon this point i cannot comment ,  having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously .  however ,  what i can say with certainty ,  is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass ;  let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun !   ok .  . so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective .  . do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character ?  or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series ?   the point is ,  yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm !   former tarzan ,  ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this  ( and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot !  )  and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles .  also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman .   best scene ?  far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke ,  lemonade and milk at a formal occasion !  also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen !   priceless !   simply put ,  the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it .  great fun from start to finish !   ( and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed !  )
1	***possible spoilers***  i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences .  ron ely is just right as doc .  cool ,  calm ,  almost always in control ( and with an occasional twinkle in his eye )  .  what more can one ask for ?  i have never read a doc savage book ,  so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring-do .  many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark ,  which i don't think is fair .  the difference in budget is astounding ( raiders must have at least 10 times the budget )  .  doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has .  special effects are also at a minimum but come on people ,  the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right .  the sousa music is catchy ( love that theme song- every time i watch the film ,  i end up humming the theme for days )  . the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy .  highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas .  not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib  ( really !  )  .  overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day .  i give it 7 out of 10 .   doc savage ,  doc savage .  .  . thank the lord he's here !
1	most people miss hollywood's point of concept .  if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child ,  within the confines of the law then i ,  approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage .   in all times of conflict or war ,  the public and government look for heroes to decorate .  the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as doc savage ,  james bond ,  superman ,  batman ,  spiderman and others .  doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond ,  superman or any of the others .  all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character ,  not the 'man of bronze' .
1	the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as  " camp "   ( i . e .  ,  the 60's batman show )  for tv and movie .  thus you have combat sequences with subtitles  ( come on !  )  ,  a cluelessly unromantic doc savage  ( he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps ,  not an idiot )  ,  monk mayfair in a nightsheet  ( a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights )  ,  and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute .  and when they're not doing booming sousa march scores ,  the tinkly little  " funny "  music undercuts much of the drama .   even as such ,  this movie is .  .  . okay .  it's fun ,  and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps .  except for monk ,  as has been mentioned before :  he's hugely muscled ,  not obese .  and long tom ,  who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude ,  not paul gleason with an  ( inexplicable )  scarf .   the green death sequences ,  for instance ,  are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children .  but they are very close to the feel of the pulps .  when the writers and producers get it right ,  they do get it right - i'll give them that .   but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of ,  say ,  reeves' first two superman movies ,  think what we might have had then .  i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic .  there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage ,  but they're also trying to give in to the  " heroes must be camp "  attitude that batman created .  one gets the impression there was a sober ,  pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said ,   " hey ,  let's make it funny - it worked with the batman show 8 years ago !  "   but doc lives on ,  thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai .  if macrauch ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie ,  the man is truly demented .  so when the series actually gets on tv  ( allegedly mid-season in '99-00 )  ,  doc savage ,  updated to the 90's ,  will live once more .
1	this is a very entertaining movie .  a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who ,  apparently ,  think that the film was an effort at serious drama .  it was not made that way .  .  .  . it is an extremely enjoyable film ,  performed in a tongue in cheek manner .  all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us .  the fight sequences are lively ,  brisk and ,  above all ,  not gratuitous .  the so-called  " green death "  ,  utilized on a couple of occasions ,  is not ,  as i read in one review ,   " gruesome "  .  a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film .  hey ,  lighten up .  .  .  again ,  i remind one and all that this is a fun film .  each phase of this  " fight "  was captioned ,  which added to the fun aspect .  the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan .  this is not one of those martial arts films .  ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc .  another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the  " bad guy "   ( seas )  is dealt with .  i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value ,  you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner .
1	outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s ,  it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series ,  as much as  " raiders of the lost ark "  ,  only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson .  the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau ,  predating batman by two decades .  starring ron ely  ( tarzan )  as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of hidalgo .  best line ,  our hero to mona ,  holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug :   " mona ,  you're a brick !  "   paul wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat ,  captain seas is a an absolute delight .  expect a little  " raiders .  .  "  ,  a dash of  " batman "  ,  a little  " the lost world "  ,  a little  " lost horizons "  and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right .  watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music .  a prime candidate for dvd release ,  it is certainly overdue .  an unmissable treat for the whole family .  9/10
1	i was brought up on doc savage , and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now ,  i found it thoroughly entertaining . i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions , granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are .   " i don't know what it is about the doc ,  but he always gets the girls "  has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men .  this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre , and was way before it's time , it is not to be taken seriously ,  move over austin powers .  ron ely is a god . it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk .  i don't think it should be remade and bastardised ,  like i said it's a classic , it cannot be done without ron .  ( like the italian job without mini's and michael caine )  .  i give it 10/10 .
1	we so often talk of cinema landmarks - kane ,  the godfather ,  a bout de souffle .  one film however is too often overlooked by  " serious "  film critics .  i am talking of course about the classic doc savage  ( m . o . b .  )   this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism .  not to mention kung-fu .   it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history  ( until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon )  .  although a bit of a rarity ,  this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold .
1	given the title ,  this first follow-up to quartet  ( 1948 )  obviously reduces the number of w .  somerset maugham stories which comprise the film .  the author still turns up to introduce the episodes ,  but there’s no epilogue this time around ;  by the way ,  while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r . c .  sheriff ,  here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation ,  as well as noel langley  ( though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison )  .  as can be expected ,  much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members ,  namely naunton wayne ,  wilfrid hyde-white and felix aylmer  ( the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “the colonel’s lady” )  .  while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor  ( slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time )  ,  it’s still done with the utmost care ,  acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain .   “the verger” tells of a church sexton  ( james hayter )  – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest  ( michael hordern )  simply because he’s illiterate .  rather than rest on his laurels ,  despite his age ,  he not only takes a wife  ( his landlady ,  played by kathleen harrison )  but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and ,  with business flourishing ,  this is developed into a whole chain .  the last scene ,  then ,  sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who ,  not only is surprised to learn of hayter’s lack of education ,  but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy  ( and respected )  tobacconist replies ,  with some measure of irony ,  that he had the calling to be a verger !    the second episode ,  “mr .  know-all” ,  is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging :  a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man  ( nigel patrick )  ,  british despite his foreign-sounding name of kelada ,  who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun .  naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde-white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife  ( anne crawford )  .  during a fancy-dress party ,  however ,  the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him  ( a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate )  !  ;  still ,  it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation ,  wayne challenges patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford’s position if he were to tell ,  so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer !    as can also be deduced from the title ,  “sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre' morell ;  the protagonist is a new intern ,  roland culver ,  who wistfully observes the various goings-on .  the narrative ,  in fact ,  highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous  ( the ‘feud’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium ,  played by finlay currie and john laurie )  ,  one melodramatic  ( the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies )  and one bittersweet  ( the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which ,  in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘lifer’ while rennie only has a few years left to him ,  leads the couple to the altar )  .
1	a message movie ,  but a rather good one .  outstanding cast ,  top to bottom .  interesting in that bette davis's plot line is essentially back story !  the extremely negative reviews  ( name throwing at the screenplay/playwright ,  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'angles in america' ,  etc .  etc .  )  object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii .  gosh ,  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me .   theatrical and movie-making ,  and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way .  yes casablanca is a better movie  ( i guess )  ,  but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them ,  casablanca is primarily a love story .  the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot--more of a thriller .  both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors .  the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
1	the makers have chosen the best people for the job ,  and set the scene wonderfully .  every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it .  whether the period is the 20s  ( the first story )  ,  the present  ( ie 1950 )  for the middle story ,  or the 1910s  ( the last )  ,  costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created .  i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls .  roland culver as ashenden is very appealing ,  but never mind the soppy young lovers ,  it's raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions .  he usually played comical ,  pompous types ,  but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive .  the china seas  ( great 30s film starring gable and harlow )  stole the plot from the mr know all episode  ( and also nicked a story by kipling )  .  i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat .  i love that posh bird who plays his wife ,  too .
1	trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable .  it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young .  the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch .   observation .  in film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile .   " small morality "  storytelling is quaint  ( or coy )  only in the eye of the beholder--thankfully .  story content--well told--can overcome it's time ,  subject or place .   ironically ,  there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era .  inserting  " small morality "  content--occasionally--might provide a dimension lacking .
1	this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales .  the first one is the verger ,  which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable .  after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write .  so what does he do ?  opens a tobacco shop ,  of course !   the second is mr .  know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten ,  until i heard the familiar introduction .  another 15 minute one ,  and also very good .  it worked better on film than in a book for me ,  but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time ,  afterall .   the 3rd one is nearly a let-down .  almost an hour in length ,  it simply drags .  it's not all that bad ,  but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 .  i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour ,  and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing !   overall i give them 8 ,  9 ,  and 6 out of 10 ,  respectively .
1	say what you will about schmaltz .  one beauty of this film is that it is not pro-american .  it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion .  it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose .   to me ,  the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly  ( bette davis' mother and brother )  .  as fanny says ,   " we've been shaken out of the magnolias .  "   in today's political climate where ,  led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings ,  we sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance .  it can't all be blamed on mr .  bush - after all ,  we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed .  now ,  with complete justification ,  we americans are reviled throughout the world .   today ,  we watch this film with a new awareness :  that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character ,  but ,  a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts .  i'm not comparing george bush to adolph hitler .  but ,  i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror ,  hatred ,  and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things .   sadly ,  the blackmailer ,  who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement ,  no matter how immoral ,  is most like the leaders of our country ,  those who support them ,  and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand ,  that they can't even be bothered to vote .   a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals .   geoff
1	made after quartet was ,  trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham .  here the three stories are the verger ,  mr .  know-it-all ,  and sanitorium .  the first two are comic  ( the verger is like a prolonged joke ,  but one with a good pay-off )  ,  and the last more serious  ( as health issues are involved )  .  again the author introduces the film and the stories .   james hayter ,  soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick ,  is the hero in the verger .  he holds this small custodial-type job in a church ,  but the new vicar  ( michael hordern )  is an intellectual snob .  when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him .  hayter has saved some money ,  so he tells his wife  ( kathleen harrison )  he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop .  he has a good eye ,  and his store thrives .  soon he has a whole chain of stores .  when his grandchild is christened by hordern ,  the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-verger .  the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments .  i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting .   according to maugham he met a man like max kelada  ( nigel patrick )  on a cruise .  in mr .  know-it-all kelada is a splashy ,  friendly ,  and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip  ( regarding jewelry )  by steamship .  his state-room mate is mr .  grey  ( the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde-white )  who is somewhat ,  silently disapproving of max .  max likes to enliven things ,  and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment .  at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-maugham story and film china seas  ( 1935 )  ,  as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake  ( after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real )  .  i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion .   sanitorium is the longest segment .  roland culver plays  " ashenden "   ( the fictional alter-ego of maugham - a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent )  .  here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health .  he finds a remarkable crew of people ,  including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman ,  finlay currie as an irascible scotsman ,  john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is  " at war "  with currie ,  raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up ,  and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness .  culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions .  the last ,  dealing with simmons and rennie ,  is ironic but deeply moving .   it was a dandy follow-up to the earlier quartet ,  and well worth watching .
1	wilhelm grimm  ( alexander knox )  stands trial for nazi crimes .  three witnesses give evidence - father warecki  ( henry travers )  ,  wilhelm's brother karl  ( erik rolf )  and wilhelm's former lover marja  ( marsha hunt )  - before wilhelm speaks in his own defense .  the film ends after the court sums up .  .  .  .   the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand .  the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna  ( shirley mills )  ,  who wilhelm is accused of raping ;  the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps ;  and the church service where willie grimm  ( richard crane )  denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina  ( dorothy morris )  ,  marja's daughter ,  after she has been shot at a brothel .   throughout the film ,  knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter ,  resentful and evil man .  martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest .  this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished .
1	this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed .  while late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were ,  this film ,  unlike other hollywood films to date ,  is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocities .   the film begins in a courtroom in the future--after the war is over  ( the film was made in 1944--the war ended in may ,  1945 )  .  in this fictitious world court ,  a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes .  wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks .  at first ,  it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis .  however ,  after a while ,  it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster .  these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama .   all in all ,  the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors .  there are many compelling scenes and performances--especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears .  it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first .  overall ,  it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film .   fyi--this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film ,  but hitler was referred to as  " that paper hanger "  .  this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper .  this is in fact not true--previously he'd been a  " starving artist "  ,  homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi .  a horrible person ,  yes ,  but never a paper hanger !
1	never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example :  norway .  the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates .  alexander knox ,   (  wilhelm gimm )  " gorky park "  returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town .  he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either .  as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind .  marsha hunt ,  ( marja pacierkowski )  ,  " chloe's prayer "  ,  played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm .  there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives .  the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers .  if you have not seen this film ,  and like this subject matter ,  give it some of your time ;  this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly .
1	the only reason i give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies ,  in my opinion ,  that are perfect .  this little b picture is a taut story ,  well told .  i've always been intrigued by alexander knox ,  but have seen him very few movies .  here he plays wilhelm grimm ,  a sad little man who turns into a monster .  he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse .  the performance is one of the most chilling performances i've ever seen .  since world war 2 ,  actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars .  i imagine that since this was made during the war ,  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil .  but knox puts in that kind of performance--a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer .  i still can't get over it .   marsha hunt ,  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly ,  is cast against type in probably the best performance i've ever seen her give ,  too .  maybe not oscar worthy ,  but the best of her career .  nothing against her ;  i have enjoyed her in those  " slight "  roles she often played .  but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .   if you like human drama stories ,  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis ,  i highly recommend this fine little film .
1	this one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says .  that is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after wwii -- particularly the  " liberation "  of dachau .  it is clear that ,  as of the middle of the war ,  we knew exactly what was happening to the jews .  the sequence that shows a  " transport "  is vivid ,  almost as if based upon an actual newsreel  ( the nazis liked to record their atrocities )  .  knox as the nazi is brilliant .  he charts the course of a nazi career .  that charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other germans ,  at first laughing at hitler ,  then incredulous ,  and finally helpless .  that contrast ,  however ,  permits us to believe in the  " conversion "  of one young nazi officer to an anti-nazi stance .  that did happen ,  as witness the several attempts against hitler ,  most notably the staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out .  a strong film ,  effectively using flashbacks ,  accurately predicting the nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended .
1	this movie was extremely funny ,  i would like to own this for my vintage collection of 1970s movie must see again list ,  i know this cast of characters  , they are people that i have met over the years and that prompt me to search out this comedy ,  unfortunately this was never put to dvd or vhs .  redd foxx always a clown of comedy ,  pearl baily a great match as his wife witty and sassy ,  norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future if it is out , dennis dugan crazy funny man  .  miss dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience .  love , lust , strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance  , situation comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake ,  i do think finding cast would be extremely difficult maybe impossible , except jerry seinfeld playing dennis dugan role ,  this earmarks a couple of seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to norman is that you  , keeping them in the closest was surely impossible as impossible to reform pretend hooker girl friend and infidelity of a parent .  this movie was a wild ride advise of a cabbie ,  remind me of episode kramer takes advice of his caddie over his lawyer .   (  episode from seinfeld  )  the parents have there jaw dropping moment ,  fun over fun it is screaming bring me back  .
1	norman ,  is that you ?  was  ( this is all third hand ,  so take it with a grain of salt )  adapted to an african american family from a jewish one ,  when it made the transition off stage and onto screen .  also ,  it was one of those movies originally filmed in video ,  so the prints from the theater can't have been that great .  still ,  performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good .    what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece :  it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70s about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family .  for that reason alone ,  it's pretty interesting- if not a little  " hollywood "  .  don't believe me ?  check out lines about curtains ,  etc .  very stereotypical .  not too deep .   but .  .  .  the movie really shines in a couple of areas .  there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife ,  who's run away with his brother  (  !  )  to ensenada in a souped up pinto .  the phone conversation across the border is really memorable .    but .  .  .  the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his/their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs .  to the best of my knowledge ,  this is the only time that routine was filmed .  and ,  it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version ,  i'm told .  still ,  it's vintage madame ,  and shouldn't be missed .  people are still stealing lines from wayland ;  the man was truly gifted .  enjoy the movie !
1	i saw a trailer for this on afro promo ,  the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring african-americans .  it looked like what it is ;  a highly tendentious  " wacky "  comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay .  it would seem that redd foxx's  ( rf )  wife has left him for his brother ,  who works with him at  " the store "  back in phoenix .  he has taken the bus to visit his son norman is los angeles .   so as rf arrives ,  norman ,  wearing nothing but powder-blue bikini shorts ,  gets out of his waterbed to answer the door .  trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor ,  norman tries to wake his lover ,  who steadfastly refuses to budge .  it was just to the point where i wrote  " why won't he wake up ?  "  when suddenly he does ,  and me and my friend's jaws dropped for the first of many times as we are presented with our first glimpse of the blue-eyed ,  swirl-hairdoed garson ,  norman's white live-in lover ,  who just  " had the most faaaaaabulous dream "  garson is a flaming queen of a type that can only be imagined as emerging from 1976 l . a .  he has dresses and a purse and big clunky jewelry ,  and seems to have modeled both his look and persona on carol brady from the brady bunch .   norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit .  garson goes to stay with waylon flowers ,  and madam answers the phone when norman calls .    so rf attempts to reach his wife in mexico .  while he is on the phone ,  garson comes in to pack his dress and rf confronts him .  with a burst of 70s soul music meant to evoke his dawning revelation  ( but sounding more like we're about to hear a very special track by the emotions )  ,  he realizes that his son is gay .   his first impulse is  " i'll kill him .  i'll kill him .  "  then rf goes on a long walk ,  wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have ,  such as  " maybe we toilet trained him too soon .  "  his thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk ,  for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man .  surprisingly ,  he goes to a bookstore and buys about eight books on homosexuality .  this ,  it must be said ,  is about eight more books on homosexuality than my parents bought .  he then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all !    rf then hires audrey ,  a six-foot amazon prostitute  ( in this amazing fur thing )  played by tamara dobson of cleopatra jones .  he hired her for norman to try out heterosexuality ,  but this pisses norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend melody .   then garson comes over and offers to take rf out for the night .  he commiserates over the loss of rf's wife ,  and tells the tale of his own mother ,  who harbors an irrational prejudice against pilippinos because  " she was molested at a luau .  "  they attend a long featured performance of wayon and madam ,  which culminates in madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose .  once more ,  mouths were agape .   so it seems that ,  wouldn't ya just know it ,  rf and garson have a wonderful evening together !  you see ,  staid ,  traditional older black men just have to see the crappy ,  highly-effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to all the gay world has to offer !  it's really just that simple !  this still does not prevent rf from yelling  " rape !  "  when garson wakes him from a bad dream .  it ends less predictably than you'd think .   there was so much that was just off .  what is the basis of norman and garson 's relationship ?  they don't seem to have any rapport ,  and norman has no qualms whatsoever about kicking garson out ,  and even when he comes around to stand up for himself ,  he never defends garson or talks about their relationship .  there were some kind of sweetly quaint touches like rf going to buy all those books on homosexuality-and sitting right down on the park bench to read them !  i like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality ,  rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends .   other than that ,  it's kind of just what it seems like :  a little relic of a bygone era ,  an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance ,  we could all learn to love and understand one another !  and because of the whole naiveté of this thing ,  the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated ,  and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years .  i guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them ,  and are willing to get them drunk in order to sleep with ,  and by extension convert ,  them .   ------ hey ,  check out cinema de merde ,  my website on bad and cheesy movies  ( with a few good movies thrown in )  .  you can find the url in my email address above .
1	even though this movie came out a year before i was born ,  it is definetely one of my favorite comedies .  it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality .  like most parents ,  he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like .  his son ,  norman ,  is now grown up and living on his own .  when his father ,  ben ,  finds out that his son is gay ,  he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him .  the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie--when ben gets to norman's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag  (  " norman .  .  .  is that you ?  "  )  .  the movie had me laughing from start to finish .  redd foxx is great .  although a lot of the content is stereotypical ,  i didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled ,  and it even has a good ending .  highly recommended .
1	a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth .  i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then vanish :  high anxiety ,  the cheap detective ,  the black bird ,  don't look now we're being shot at .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  and have no profile at all today .  norman was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it ,  laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again .  famous for being shot on videotape and transferred to film ,  an experiment at the time ,  norman is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that the farrelly brothers should look at remaking today .  if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and slant either .  it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong .  just as it should be .  in fact as a groovy 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today .
1	melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which ,  this time ,  he inhabits the role of a detective who can't place love before duty and adventure ,  and the warmly beautiful joan blondell  ( who ,  far from being illiterate ,  as one reviewer suggested ,  wrote a novel about her early life )  is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering sweetheart . it's almost a screwball comedy ,  almost a thin man-type movie ,  almost a series ,  i guess ,  that didn't quite make it to a sequel .  it doesn't quite reach classic status ,  but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script ,  fine character actors ,  and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don't notice that williams  ( douglas )  isn't exactly columbo when it comes to detecting .  i wish there were more films like this .
1	the  " amazing mr .  williams "  stars melvyn douglas ,  who did five films in 1939 ,  one of which was ninotchka with garbo .  his co-star was joan blondell  ( maxine )  ,  who also did five films that year ,  three of which they made together !  douglas is lt .  williams ,  and he and his co-horts are presented with a dead body ,  and they must figure out what really happened .  viewers will recognize his co-workers - the actors  ( clarence kolb ,  donald macbride ,  don beddoe )  always played positions of authority .  .  .  senators ,  bank presidents ,  policemen .  this who-dunnit has a flair of comedy to it -- the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other ,  and even williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally .  some fun gags - williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend .  there's a lot of fun stuff in here ,  so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on .  don't want to give away any spoilers ,  so you'll have to catch it on turner classic movies .  director alexander hall made mostly comedies ,  and was reportedly engaged to lucy at some point .
1	melvyn douglas and joan blondell co-star in  " the amazing mr .  williams ,  "  a 1939 mystery/comedy that's quite good ,  although forgotten ,  probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 .   douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job ,  while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed .  what happens in this film is no exception - he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the aisle yet again .   both stars were excellent at comedy ,  worked together well  ( and often )  ,  and help make this battle of the sexes fun .  edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support .   as you can read in other reviews ,  melvyn douglas doesn't make much of a woman .   entertaining if a little on the long side .   one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas ,  one of our greatest actors .  he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man .  he wasn't lazy ,  but rather ,  a very hard-working actor  ( who made it look easy )  who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career .  he just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system .  i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in  " hud "  and  " i never sang for my father "  and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .
1	the only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself .  i usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie i don't know much about .  it's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile ,  because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast ,  you don't get an idea of what to expect .  i read the review before watching this title and i don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from .  douglas and blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered ,  even when the material was not the greatest .  i found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable .  it isn't one of the great all-time classics ,  but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies .  if you are a fan of these stars ,  you will not be disappointed .
1	what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films ?  well ,  whatever it was ,  the magic may also be found in this columbia picture .  it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show .   ( maltin's movie book does not contain it .  )  in nearly every department ,  amazing mr .  williams is a jewel .   it's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended .  as the wedding bells are about to ring ,  he gets called to the scene of a murder .  the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force .  there are a lot of laughs in the process .   melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy .  joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight .  edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious .   the film goes on a bit too long ,  but who cares ?  the screwball comedies are always able to entertain ,  and this film belongs right in there with the best .
1	delightful minor film ,  juggling comedy and detective ,  romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams  ( melvyn douglas )  balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll  ( joan blondell )  and his duty to the force as an ace detective .   this hodge-podge may not appeal to all viewers today ,  but in its day ,  it had something to offer every member of the movie-going family ,  and the resolution to the rather tired feeling-versus-duty plot is original and refreshing ,  and well worth the wait .     " the amazing mr .  williams "  contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history ,  and its bright comic repartee sparkles .  ludicrously frocked ,  melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines :   " i'd walk down main street in a turkish towel before i'd let any woman control my life !  "  and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb :   " good grief !  you look like my aunt nellie ! '   the crime-solving here is standard fare ,  although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life .    from today's vantage point ,   " the amazing mr .  williams "  is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct ,  all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries .  while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes ,  at times it is both subtle and penetrating ,  playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film ,  but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene .
1	i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 ,  though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness .  the film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the us into the war .  paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family .  he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture .  bette davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time .  as the film begins ,  they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years ,  they are going to relax and stop running .   the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems .  while this had a very noble goal at the time ,  it just seems phony today .  in particular ,  the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true .  it sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children .  they were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off ,  at times ,  as a brat .  about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them  ( though he had no discernible accent )  .   it's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog ,  as it just doesn't sound true to life .  the story was based on the play by his lover ,  lillian hellman .  and ,  the basic story idea and plot is good ,  .  .  . but the dialog is just bad at times .  overall ,  an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments ,  .  .  . but that's really about all .
1	this movie is very good .  the screenplay is enchanting .  but meryl streep is most impressive .  her performance is excellent .  she brings me to go into the heart of her role .
1	this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all .  generally speaking ,  i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories .  and this one is great !  besides meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise ,  the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on .  the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture ,  after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans ,  and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society .  it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people  ( the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example )  are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would ,  for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices ,  shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions .  the other face of the so-called  " civilized "  society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings  ( needless to say ,  this is very general ,  even though this specific tale unfolds in australia )  ,  that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty .  must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking .
1	i believe they were telling the truth the whole time .  . u cant trust anything in the wild .  .  .  they family went through hell . those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them .  but still having to deal with the rumours .  as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister .  i cant believe this case went on for so long . seems like the jury couldn't see the truth ,  even if it bit them on the ass . i feel for this family ,  and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them ,  i would . i have no idea what they went through ,  i cant even imagine it .  after watching this movie ,  i was in tears ,  and had to check on my little girl in bed .  .  . i think everyone should watch this .
1	when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock ,  australia ,  lindy chamberlain  ( meryl streep )  sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience .  for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press ,  and the whole thing turns into a circus .  lindy doesn't help matters either because she won't play to the jury or courtroom ,  she's only herself ,  and she's a tough nut to crack ,  so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's a piece of evidence that hasn't come to light .  sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain ,  a seventh-day adventist pastor ,  who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife .  it's good  ( or bad )  to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too ,  because the australian public doesn't believe the story and the media only fans the flames .  eventually ,  lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor ,  but years later ,  a missing piece of evidence shows up and she's freed ,  but not until after the family's life is basically ruined .  a heart-breaking story ,  very well done ,  a bit long but well worth seeing .  8 out of 10 .
1	religious bigotry is rampant everywhere .  australia is not immune to it .   a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having  " killed "  her own baby .  i don't mean to spoil the story for you ,  but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison .   buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe .   this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors .   both meryl streep  ( with her famous aussie accent )  and sam neill ,  whose accent is his native-born pronunciation ,  are outstanding .  those with supporting roles are also quite good .   you will remember this movie for many years .   see it !
1	this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based .   the right to be presumed  " innocent until proven guilty "  is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society ;  but according to fred schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial ,  it was not granted to lindy chamberlain ,  accused of killing her baby .  the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely  ( a dingo was alleged to have taken it )  ,  but those implying her guilt even more so ,  and there was no solid evidence against her .  but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt ,  and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media  ( and the media themselves ,  of course ,  were anything but innocent in this process )  .  so although cleared by an initial inquest ,  they were later prosecuted and convicted .  although chamberlain was eventually released ,  this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence  " proving "  their innocence ,  something no defendants should have to produce .   'a cry in the dark' is well acted throughout ,  especially by meryl streep ,  who puts on a convincing australian accent  ( at least to this pom's ears )  and manages keep lindy sympathetic  ( to us )  while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure .  the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking ,  because we believe in the characters as real .    regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story  ( something i can't comment on )  ,  the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts .  no legal system will ever be perfect ;  but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away .  i'm not a religious man ,  but the bible still contains some killer lines  ( if you'll excuse the pun )  .   " judge not lest ye be judged "  is one of them .
1	a cry in the dark   a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid ,  if unremarkable film .  this assumption came from the fact that aside from streep's best actress nomination ,  the movie received little attention from major awards groups .   little did i anticipate that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama ,  well-constructed on every level .  if you ask me ,  this is an under-appreciatted classic .   the film opens rather slowly ,  letting the audience settle into the chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that ,  at the core ,  they are an incredibly loving ,  simple family .  fred schepisi  ( the director )  selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy ,  while also showing the attentive bliss with which lindy  ( streep )  and michael  ( sam neill )  chamberlain care for their children .   while the famous line  " a dingo took my baby !  "  has become somewhat of a punchline these days ,  the movie never even comes close to laughable .  the actual death of azaria is horrifyingly captured .  it is subtle and realistic ,  leaving the audience horrified and asking questions .   the majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court ,  which suspects lindy of murder .   the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping .  as an audience member ,  i was fully invested in the chamberlain's plight .  .  .  and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media .  but at the same ,  the media/public opinion is understandable .  i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic ,  but they always had valid reasons to hold their views .   the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas .   in terms of performances ,  the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and neill .  .  .  and they deliver in every way .  for me ,  this ranks as one of  ( if not #1 )  meryl streep's best performances .  for all her mastery of different accents  ( which of course are very impressive in their own right )  ,  streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters .  i find this to be one of streep's more subtle performances ,  and she hits it out of the park .  and neill ,  an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park ,  is a perfect counterpoint to streep's performance .  from what i've seen ,  this is undoubtedly neill's finest work to date .  it's a shame he wasn't recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match streep's .  .  .  b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly .   more emotionally gripping than most films ,  and also incredibly suspenseful .  .  .  a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations .  i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams  " the dingo took my baby !  "  watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line .    .  .  .  a  .  .  .
1	fascinating movie ,  based on a true story ,  about an australian woman ,  lindy chamberlain  ( meryl streep )  accused of killing her baby daughter .  she insists that a dingo took her baby ,  but the story is highly suspicious .  the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case ,  the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media ,  and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's conviction ,  based on barely any hard evidence .  i love films that question the media ,  and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system .  i've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties .  it's not ,  as has often been said ,  a liberal movie ,  but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge .  a cry in the dark is likewise clinical .  schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic .  some may find the film boring or dry ,  but i found it engaging .
1	in august 1980 the disappearance of baby azaria chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation .  the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood .  what followed was a gross miscarriage of justice .   michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near ayers rock ,  central australia ,  that a dingo had taken their ten week old daughter from their tent as they were preparing to eat in the barbecue area .  no-one believed them .  lindy was charged with the murder of her baby ,  and michael as an accessory after the fact .  the whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing .  the chamberlain's trial was over before it began .   lindy never proved her innocence ,  so she was found guilty .  there was never enough evidence to convict her ,  yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure .  how could we as a nation even sit in judgement ?  from where we are ,  how could we possibly presume to know ?  unless there was absolute proof ,  and no reasonable doubt whatsoever ,  the chamberlains should have been acquitted .   fred schepisi's film unequivocally and whole heartedly supports the argument of john bryson's novel ,  that the chamberlains were completely innocent of the charges laid against them .  that in fact a dingo did take baby azaria on that fateful night at ayers rock .   schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation ,  hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light .  he shows australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the chamberlains pay !  his screenplay ,  co-written with robert caswell ,  vigorously stirs the emotions and will most certainly find the audience saddened and angered at the travesty of justice which occurred .   the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts .  she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the allegations and set the world straight .  even her accent is almost ,  but not quite ,  spot on .  a very good effort by the master of that trade .  sam neill is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart ,  and he starts to question his christianity .  his ,  as was streep's ,  is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly .  the entire support cast are also excellent ,  with some of australia's finest actors and actresses playing a part .   technically the film is brilliant too ,  with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour  ( especially the rock )  .  editor jill bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged ,  while bruce smeaton provides a telling score .   for all aussies this is a must see ,  a shocking look in the mirror if you will ,  at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served ,  and the truth to be known .  as michael chamberlain said  :   " i don't think anybody really understands what innocence means .  .  .  .  . to innocent people .  "   saturday ,  may 20 ,  1995 - video  even on return viewings fred schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the chamberlains ,  who lost baby azaria at ayres rock in 1980 ,  is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving .   schepisi and robert caswell have expertly transferred john bryson's novel to the screen ,  telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain ,  whose new born daughter azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down .   amid media speculation and vicious public rumour lindy was charged with the murder of her baby ,  and michael was charged as an accessory after the fact .  what followed was little more than trial by media ,  and with the australian people determined she be put away ,  lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour ,  even though the prosecution could present no motive and little other than circumstantial evidence .   meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence .  she is truly awesome ,  and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent ,  though she does her level best to sound ocker .  you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn't cast in the role ,  but star power is probably the answer .  alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam neill ,  outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes ,  while he feels powerless to do anything about it .  a strong aussie cast lend compelling support .   editing from jill bilcock is very timely ,  ian baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce smeaton's music is perfect for the part .  truly a must for all conscientious australians .   sunday ,  june 15 ,  1996 - video
1	i found it hard to like anyone in this film .  the central characters ,  lindy and michael chamberlain ,  whose daughter disappears during a night out in the australian outback ,  are not bad people ,  but then surely not all ,  or even most ,  of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better .  but though we are as sure as the film wants us to be of the guilt or innocence of the chamberlains from the start of their life's tragic disarray ,  the film takes on a more or less sociological perspective pertaining to gossip ,  news media ,  crowds ,  mobs and assumptions .  it's not a movie about the degenerate society of australia in particular ;  it's merely an account of a true story that happened there .  society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are .   when a warden insists upon killing all of an aborigine's dogs because of the unverified action of a single wild dog ,  when a randomly ruined life spins even further out of control owing to the majority of magazines ,  newspapers and tv programs distorts the tragic truth to a level of drama that provokes its consumers into a frenzy ,  there is no sign of empathy or even any kind of looking outside of one's own unaware perceptions ,  influenced left and right by the vigorous hearsay and vibes of those who surround one's life .  the reason i appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out ,  from the victims to the masses .   the evidence against lindy chamberlain aside ,  suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers .  to the public eye ,  she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter .  why was she able to keep her cool ,  even a sort of aloofness let alone holding her head up ,  for tv and the press ?  how much of the downward spiral could've been prevented had she behaved more to the public's liking in the media ?  meryl streep ,  one of ,  if not the ,  greatest actress working today ,  may not give a performance that particularly stands out ,  and frankly neither does any other actor ,  or department of film-making .  but she ,  and the screenwriters ,  do understand lindy .  what is infuriating is that it's not that difficult .  apparently ,  she was not naturally prone to showing emotion in public in any case .  whether or not she is approachable as a lovable character in the immediate sense ,  we are naturally prone to sympathize with her situation .   whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as sophie's choice ,  the devil wears prada ,  angels in america or other such work ,  it is a triumph .  it is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself .  she frustrates us because we don't know what she's thinking or feeling .  it took me awhile to feel endeared toward her ,  but this is the movie's way of suggesting the reaction of the public's attention .   she is married to a pastor ,  and they both practice a religion that is in a small minority and thus misinterpreted by most .  initially ,  they react to their loss as if to be reconciling themselves to god's will ,  kick-starting a rumor mill generating the notion that their daughter's death was some sort of ritual killing on their part .  whatever happened to the little girl ,  her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify ,  so the first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry .  .  . well .  .  .   meryl streep and sam neill are constantly on screen ,  but the australian public plays the real leads here .  like punctuation for each plot advance ,  director fred schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office ,  where the public tries lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections .   this golan-globus docudrama is not particularly memorable .  the setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out .  but it is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public .
1	this movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to casablanca but paul lukas beat out humphrey bogart for best actor .  i don't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor ,  i just don't think she did a very good job .  bette davis and paul lukas and their three kids are leaving mexico and coming into the united states in the first scene of the movie .  they are going by train to davis's relatives house .  davis and lukas were in the underground to stop the nazis so they are very tired and need rest .  but when they arrive home ,  their is a nazi living there and their's not much either can do about it .  it turns out the nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with lukas .  their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself .
1	i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story .  several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie .  the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself .  the cast just makes it that much more appealing .  meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture .  she nails mrs .  chamberlain's mannerisms ,  the accent ,  and even look .  she shows the pain ,  hurt ,  surprise ,  and anger that lindy had to endure ,  and in the process it's hard to remember that it isn't lindy .  in my opinion ,  this performance of meryl's was better than her oscar-winning turn in  " sophie's choice "  ,  and should have garnered her her third oscar .  sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain ,  and for some surprising reason ,  wasn't recognized by the academy with at least a nomination .  in all ,  this movie only receive one oscar nod  ( streep's for best actress .  )  however ,  it did receive several australian oscars and nominations .   definitely a top-rate movie :  it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast .
1	meryl streep is such a genius .  well ,  at least as an actress .  i know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents ,  but she nails the accent every time .  her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring .  mrs .  chamberlain ,  as portrayed here ,  was not particularly likable ,  nor all that smart .  but that just makes streep's work all the more remarkable .  i think she is worth all 10 or so of her oscar nominations .  about the film ,  well ,  there were a couple of interesting things .  i don't know much about australia ,  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story .  i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago ,  but it came through loud and clear yesterday .  and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues .  a pretty good film .  a bit different .  grade :  b
1	this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on australian society .  it especially looks at the problem of innuendo ,  gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas .   one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations .  not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis .  just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so .  this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings .  it's an issue that has to be constantly addressed .   the leads play the characters with depth ,  personality and sensitivity .  and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals .  some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors .  it re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals .    ( spoiler warning !  )   i have to say something very personal here ;  in that i am actually an ex-adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred ;  so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most .  i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality ,  and emotional heart .  i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers .  it captured the themes of the story brilliantly .   i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to  " play the best case for their character they could "  .  while this is especially apt for this story ,  i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .
1	once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they .  .  .  somehow .  .  .  managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended ,  you'll find that it's not half bad .  the plot is engaging and interesting ,  and the pacing is fast ,  with this covering many situations ,  and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken .  where this really stands out is the acting .  the performances are excellent .  neill and streep are both impeccable .  it's also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film ,  and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent .  the cinematography and editing are nice enough ,  but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff .  this movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling .  while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture ,  i understand that it is quite close to the truth .  there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this .  it is ,  at times ,  a downright great courtroom drama .  i recommend this to any fellow fan of such .  7/10
1	meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense .  based on the book  " evil angels "  and titled so in its australian release ,  a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch .  it presents a scenario that's all too real for us in america :  the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target .   lindy chamberlain was this woman .  being someone who spoke her mind ,  someone who didn't play the sympathy card ,  and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal ,  she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child .  the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece .  and through it all ,  lindy remained as stoic as ever ,  even when her husband michael was falling apart .   this stance ,  of course ,  is the power of strength ,  as unsympathetic as it may look like ,  and people happen to react strongly to that .  they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn ,  not sit there and look blank .  people don't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations .  meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold ,  but not unfeeling woman ,  one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty .  because of her ,  sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to ,  or the chamberlains would be too detached ,  and no one wants to see that .  except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media .  they'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public .
1	spoilers following :  i picked up the book  " evil angels "  when it first came out knowing nothing of the case .  just to give the press and the austrialian people a break here ,  i was quite far into it before i began to question the chamberlain's guilt .  the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did .  john bryson told the story just as it was presented to the jurors  ( and picked up by the press )  of the arterial spray ,  the actelone  (  ?  ?  )  plates ,  dr .  james cameron's certainty that the collar was cut with scissors ,  that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up ,  bloody hand print ,  etc .  all quite convincingly .  after all ,  these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie ,  and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all .  it was also highly technical evidence ,  difficult for a layman to understand .  to this point ,  beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials ,  hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human ;  people didn't believe it was possible .  the public was suspicious of the seventh day adventists ,  whose origins made them appear to be a cult ,  and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt .  were it not for dedicated ,  selfless lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial testimony ,  finding azaria's clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail .  the book shook me for that reason ,  and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since  ( excepting oj of course )  .  i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better .  i've always liked sam ,  who i could identify with completely ,  and meryl was perfect as always .  beautiful photography ,  haunting music .  i think it's not only a very good ,  but a very important ,  movie .  too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released .
1	lindy  ( meryl streep )  and her husband michael  ( sam neill )  have just welcomed a baby girl ,  azaria .  as seventh day adventists ,  they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church ,  with their two older boys looking on .  michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer's rock ,  one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia .  not being wealthy ,  the family camps near the site .  after a wonderful first day ,  lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents .  suddenly ,  she hears azaria crying .  as lindy rushes to the tent ,  a dingo dog is just exiting ,  shaking his head .  the baby is gone and soon ,  so is the dingo .  although the entire camp looks for the baby ,  she is not found .  concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child ,  the chamberlains struggle to accept god's decision and go on with their lives .  but ,  unfortunately ,  the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby .  she is subsequently arrested and put on trial .  how could this happen ?  this is a great depiction of real events that shows how  " mob rule "  is not a figment of the imagination .  the entire country turns against the chamberlains ,  in part because they are seen as odd .  streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy ,  whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way .  neill ,  likewise ,  does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael .  the cast is one of the largest ever ,  with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy's case .  the costumes ,  scenery ,  script ,  direction and production are all top of the line .  if you have never seen or heard of this film ,  remedy that straight away .  it is not a far cry from reality to say that this  " cry "  should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media .
1	this is a true story of an australian couple wha are charged with murder when their infant child disappears .  meryl streep is excellent ,  as always ,  and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable .   the media frenzy that surrounded this case in australia is reminiscent of the sam sheppard murder case in ohio during the 50's .  these real-life situations demonstrate that the media in fact can affect how a criminal case is handled .  i well remember the cleveland plain dealer running a huge headline stating  " why isn't sam sheppard in jail ?  "  .  the prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure ,  and sheppard was tried and convicted .  only after years in jail was he exonerated .   i love movies which tell a true story ,  do it in an interesting way ,  and make an important point in the process .  this is one of those movies .  other good movies which tell the story of innocent persons charged with crimes include  " hurricane "  ,   " the thin blue line "  ,  and  " breaker morant "  .  in particular ,  the latter is another australian film which is highly recommended .   8/10
1	an unqualified  " 10 .  "  the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  " old "  hollywood .  sam neill and meryl streep are very good together .  neill matches streep line for line ,  and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best ,  notwithstanding the intensity of his role .  this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama ,  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms .  the movie -- which won several top awards in australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director ,  but wonderful and authentic australian locales .  it proves that people are the same the world over .  and ,  after all these years ,  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line ,  accent and all :   " a dingo ate moy baby !  "  including that imp  " elaine benis "  on  " seinfeld .  "
1	when i first saw  " a cry in the dark "  ,  i had no idea what the plot was .  but when i saw it ,  i was shocked at what it portrayed .  when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class ,  i realized a second point :  communication issues .  you see ,  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain's  ( meryl streep )  baby ,  she and her husband michael  ( sam neill )  were grief-stricken but didn't show it .  as seventh day adventists ,  they believed that god willed this to happen ,  and so they couldn't mourn it .  but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness ,  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself .   the point is ,  the wrong message got communicated to the public ,  and it turned people against lindy .  even though this was a pure accident ,  it still happened .  it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media ,  regardless of any media outlet's political views .   as for the performances ,  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  ( no surprise there )  ,  and sam neill is equally great .  you will probably get blown away just by what you see here .  definitely one of fred schepisi's best movies ever .
1	meryl streep was incredible in this film .  she has an amazing knack for accents ,  and she shows incredible skill in this film overall .  i really felt for her when lindy was being persecuted .  she was played realistically ,  too .  she got cranky ,  upset ,  and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt .  i didn't expect much from the film initially ,  but i really got interested in it ,  and the movie is based on a real person and real events .  it turned out to be better than i had anticipated .  sam neill was also outstanding ;  this is the best work i've seen from him ,  and i've really liked him in other movies  ( the piano ,  for example )  .  i gave the film a 7 ,  but if i could rate just the acting ,  i'd give the it a 9 . 5 ,  and a perfect 10 for streep .
1	" a cry in the dark "  is a masterful piece of cinema ,  haunting ,  and incredibly though provoking .  the true story of lindy chamberland ,  who ,  in 1980 ,  witnessed a horrific sight ,  seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent ,  while camping on the austrailian outback .  azaria  ( the baby )  was never seen again ,  and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world .  meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy ,  as she always does .  but the one thing that helps  " a cry in the dark "  never fall flat is the brilliant direction .  a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case ,  tears are brought to the eyes .  the concept is nothing less then terrifying ,  and afterwards you are left haunted ,  but also inspired .
1	watch on the rhine is one of the best anti-nazi propaganda films made during world war two .  paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar .  bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was .  i would recommend this film to those interested in that era ,  and ,  of course ,  the fabulous films of the late ,  great ,  ms .  bette davis .
1	some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them .  as i watched this film ,  made in 1988 ,  in 1999 ,  i thought i was watching the o . j .  simpson debacle  ( although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation )  .   the australian news media ,  if this movie is to be believed ,  devoured the case of a possible infanticide and truth was left as an afterthought .  it was scary to see the scenes of invasive ,  swarming media hordes ,  ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society .   equally appalling is the media's depiction as indifferent and uncomprehending of the technical information in the case .  i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case  ( the accused are seven-day adventists )  .   today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important .   streep is excellent as usual ,  and this is the best i've ever seen sam neill .  the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible .
1	this is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch .  i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people ,  in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby .   meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good .  let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent .   ( she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts .  )   without giving anything away ,  all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .
1	roll is a wonderful little film .  toby malone plays an 18 year old kid  ( very well acted ,  by the way )  who is into soccer .  malone's cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags ,  a drug lord ,  some tough bikers ,  some cops ,  and some prostitutes  .  .  .  and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law ,  what the contents of either gym bag is ,  and even what gender a key biker is .  parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrels .   for me ,  roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll .  those opinions are :  1 .  i really want to visit australia one day .  the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation .   2 .  some of the best filmmakers in the are australian .  the cinematography in roll was especially impressive .  i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes .   3 .  australian women are hot !
1	mat spirogolou's  ( toby malone )  family know he is a talented footballer ,  and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club .  they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him .   but the cousins are like chalk and cheese :  one a naive farm boy ,  the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters .  mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day .   having missed his cousin george  ( damien robertson )  on arrival in the city ,  mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one .   toby malone ,  probably better known for his work in theatre ,  puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager .  there are telltale signs of a low budget ,  but as with so many other low-budget movies there's more fun ,  seemingly more spontaneity ,  and more charm ,  than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster .
1	i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of roll .   roll is about a country boy ,  mat  ( toby malone )  who has dreams of becoming a sports star .  mat travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george  ( damien robertson )  .  well ,  that was the plan anyway .  george is involved with a gangster ,  tiny  ( john batchelor )  and is making a delivery for him .  needless to say ,  mat gets dragged into george's world .    i thought it was great how mat teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches mat how to relax and enjoy life a little .  toby and damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job .   every character in the movie complimented each other very well ,  the two cops were great .  david ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie .  tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters 'pando' from two hands .   one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it showcased the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years ,  perth and fremantle .  it was good to see sights and landmarks that i grew up with ,  especially the old ferris wheel .   this rocks 'n' rolls
1	a country-boy aussie-rules player  ( mat )  goes to the city the night before an all-important afl trial match ,  where he is to be picked up by his cousin .  and then things go wrong .   his no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer tiny  ( who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian )  .  needless to say ,  mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos ,  and it isn't long before thoughts of tomorrow's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night's frantic events unravel .   accomplished western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy mat ,  and successfully plays a part well below his age .  best support comes from john batchelor as tiny ,  and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events .  roll is fast-paced ,  often funny ,  and a very worthwhile use of an hour .
1	i've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be .  toby malone's performance really stood out ,  i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film ,  which itself is a lot of fun ,  very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters ,  quite an achievement considering it's short running time .  there are plenty of good twists throughout as well ,  it will keep you guessing until the end .  other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the sneaky attractive jesse .  it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off ,  you could do a lot worse than checking this out ,  you won't regret it .  good fun .  7/10
1	a film i expected very little from ,  and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be .  roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good' ,  it is funny throughout ,  the characters are endearing and the pace is just right .   toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt ,  said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams .  he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny .  watch out for these two .   highly recommended .
1	this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments .  i loved the character of matt ,  and also tiny .  they seemed the most engaging and funny characters ,  and certainly the most interesting .  matt is very good  ( as is his no good cousin )  ,  and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy .  i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor ,  eric bana .  my personal favourite part was the brothel scene ,  loved that .  overall ,  i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating .  the penalty however ,  i was disappointed in .  it was a side foot curl ,  rather than the appropriate laces blast .   i am of course kidding .   :  )
1	" a wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone ,  not always he that has done something .  " --emperor marcus aurelius   the dvd release of  " watch on the rhine "  could not come at a better moment .  it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett  ( hellman scholar bernard f .  dick's audio commentary affirms his authorship )  .  it presents a subtle performance by bette davis ,  who took a subdued secondary role long after she'd become the workhorse queen at the warner bros .  lot .  equally significantly ,  it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose .   sure ,  you say ,  like we needed that .  we've heard cary grant sermonizing in  " destination tokyo "   ( 1943 )  about japanese boys and their bushido knives .  we've watched jackboots stomp the living hills in  " the sound of music "   ( 1965 )  .  we've toured an england callously occupied by germany in  " it happened here "   ( 1966 )  .  yet ,  truth to tell ,  we still need the message spread .   i have an 81-year-old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly .  he feels that fdr connived the u . s .  into a foreign fight we didn't need ,  and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin .  he's encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan .   the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland ,  europe ,  or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in 1939 .  buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn't confronted the nazis ,  drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france ,  no war would have engulfed the west .  he believes that without the rigors of total war ,  no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem .   some commenters on this site feel that  " watch "  sags under the weight of stale propaganda .  maybe .  however ,  neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film's point :  some people hurt and kill to grab other people's land ,  goods ,  and liberty ;  such people dominated the axis powers and  " enough "  didn't appear in their vocabulary .   paul lukas deserved the oscar he won .  he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors .  they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines ,  for actively facing down torturers and murderers .  bernard dick notes that hellman didn't care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical .  of course ,  as a hungarian he had seen first-hand bela kun's bloody  " dictatorship of the proletariat "  replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy's right-wing tyranny .   in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett ,  henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves .  his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in 1944 during the plot of july 20th against hitler .  in april 1940 ,  however ,  he pragmatically abets the nazi cause ,  although he insults herr blecher  " the butcher "  and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader .   teck ,  a pauper and possible cuckold ,  wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire-shattering great war and the greater world-wide economic depression .  he has no political convictions ,  no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow .  mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt-out case's old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace .   lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man's hostess ,  a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way--but who doesn't adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls .  she and her pallid office-bound son belong to the american version of von ramme's and de brancovis' privileged kind .  however ,  this family hasn't seen ruin and never will .  they're moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it .   this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan .   " watch on the rhine "  has a manicured period look .  its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets .  yet hellman and hammett's film has gut-based power .  audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march .
1	plato's run is an entertaining b movie with gary busey . it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to . gary busey plays plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful cuban crime lord now on the run plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by steve bauer  ( scarface )  and action star jeff speaksman  ( the expert )  .  what i liked about plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and steve bauer is good as plato's sidekick even jeff speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10
1	when i read other comment , i decided to watch this movie .  .  .   first ,  cast specially michael madsen and tamer karadagli ;  good enough .  .  .   film , very intelligence and interesting because  , cast have a lot of international specially european actor and actress like from turkey and russsia .  .  .   second , story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you'll like in my opinion .  .  .   third , final chapter is not special or interesting , it's regular like other action movies .  .  .   finally , i recommend to watch this movie .  .  . and i hope you'll love it enjoy  : d
1	in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon .  i was 23 ,  and had been married for a little over three years ,  and was beginning to come out as a lesbian .  i saw this movie on an old black and white tv ,  with terrible reception ,  alone ,  and uninterrupted ,  in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story .  i was living in a small house in tucson arizona ,  and it was summertime .  .  .  like everyone else here ,  i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth ,  and its residue of fragile magic ,  and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday .  i'll keep checking in .  i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel's 'the other side of venus' .  it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy .  .  .
1	the previous reviewer has said it exactly .  i saw it once ,  was enchanted ,  saw it a second time when it was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first airing .  i still remember some of the scenes .  the setting is the opening of the 20th century ,  the war referred to in the title is world war i .  one of the scenes was set in a women-only section of a public place ,  which was an interesting historical note .  the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all-time great movie moments .  i don't think of this as a  " gay movie ,  "  it's an interesting and tender period love story ,  where the two principals happen to be women .  i would love to see this movie again ;  i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd .
1	as with all the other reviewers ,  this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years .  i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story .  i even wrote to the pbs station for more information .  despite all this ,  all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s .   fastward to 2002 ,  after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was ,  a vhs copy of the movie .  there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie .  the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her .  despite owning a copy ,  i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie .  you can find it at :  http : //www . johntopping . com/harvey%20perr/war%20widow/war_widow . html
1	i saw this movie in 1976 ,  my first year of living in new york .  i went on to live there for the next 26 years , but never saw anything as delicate and beautiful again as this small tv movie .  it was part of a pbs series as i recall ,  and i've never forgotten it .    there are no sex scenes to speak of ,  just delicate ,  moving ,  extraordinarily touching moments full of tension and excitement ,  all set within a conservative ,  boston  ( i think )  ,  world war 1 environment where women played the role of devoted wife awaiting the return of husband from the war ,  and did not seek out a career and financial independence .  frances lee mccain is superb in the role of career photographer and i have spent the next 30 odd years searching for her in equally challenging roles to no avail .   there has to be a video of this movie ?  sure it should be on dvd but surely at least a video ?
1	almost 30 years later i recall this original pbs film as almost unbearably tender .  periodically ,  i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd .  it's september of 2004 ,  and i keep hoping -- deep sigh .   one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime-time evening soap ;  the other ,  frances lee mccain ,  was seen in small roles here and there for a few years .  but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced ,  as i recall it ,  on a short-lived pbs series which showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights .   i watched it every time it was shown on pbs ,  maybe 2 or 3 times .  that was before the era of vcrs ,  so i have no record of it ,  except in my mind's eye .   12/31/2006 addition to above :  happy new year ,  ladies !  this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at ladyslipper . org .  my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer's own personal copy .
1	it's been a while since i've watched this movie ,  and the series ,  but now i'm refreshing my memory !  this was a very funny movie based on the classic series !  johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together .  bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee .  when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm ,  bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal .  they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county ,  unless the dukes can stop him ,  with the help of their beautiful cousin ,  daisy .  my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg ,  and sheriff rosco p .  coltrane was way too serious .  other than that ,  i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard !  !  !
1	what is wrong with you people ,  if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head .  of course the film isn't a masterpiece ,  i don't think it was aiming to be .  it was fun and funny ,  i never watched the show when i was younger ,  i only recently saw one episode ,  and when i watched the movie ,  i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere .  the movie seats were practically shaking ,  and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious .  and jessica simpson is plain hot ,  i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences .  all in all ,  i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd .  people ,  enjoy it for what it is .
1	having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised .  reality check :  the original series wasn't that good .  i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted .  the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks ,  the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment .  it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series .   back to the movie .  if you watch this film in it's own right ,  not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series ,  then it's not bad at all .  the real star is of course the general lee .  the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d . o . h .  is all about .  johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb-and-dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved .  the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy ,  burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m . c .  gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p .  coltrane ,  the way he always should have been .   if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect .  otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind .
1	loved the movie .  i even liked most of the actors in it .  but ,  for me ms .  davis' very poor attempt at an accent ,  and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch .  seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms .  davis they would be laughed off the screen .   i really think she 'phoned this one in' .  now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more .   i guess i just don't 'get' bette davis .  i've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in .  the possible exception is now voyager .   i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful  ( and i hope civil )  detail how i am totally wrong on this .  but ,  i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the stories/writing/supporting casts ,  but ,  i'll always be thinking ,  of different actresses that could have done a better job .
1	i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show .  and i really enjoyed this flick .  i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters .   it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like  " lame plot "  and  " it's much cruder than the show .  "  does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode ?  daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage .  the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot .   and as far as the plot goes .  it was the perfect dukes plot .  in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen .   while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions ,  they do a great job and work very well together .  i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though .  and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe .  in the movie roscoe is a little .  .  .  scary .   and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard ?   folks ,  allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia ,  bikinis and car chases ,  you won't be sorry .  it's just a great dumb movie !
1	i saw this movie when i was a child .  it blew me away .  this was before the days of television ,  so a movie of this magnitude ,  could send a young kid into orbit .  it so impressed me ,  that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days .  the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time .  sabu was a real delight ,  as was rex ingram as the genie .  i found myself singing  " i want to be a sailor "  for months after the film left town .  i would recommend this movie to any and everyone .  i forgot to mention conrad veidt ,  who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet .  also ,  june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture .  the color was outstanding .  give this movie an aaa !
1	next to  " star wars "  and  " the wizard of oz ,  "  this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made .  it's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films  ( maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings ,  and that it's british ,  meaning a smaller market for films )  but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation .   like all great family films ,  one can be a child ,  an adult ,  or even a teenager to enjoy this film  ( i'm currently 18 )  ,  but one must appreciate classic films first .  i absolutely adore this film .  it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa  ( perhaps my favorite classic film score )  that rivals any john williams  " star wars "  score ,  a fast but not flashy pace ,  beautiful sets ,  dialog ,  and use of color  ( both the sets and cinematography won oscars )  ,  and state-of-the-art oscar-winning special effects  ( for the time ,  and some are still stunning )  .  and ,  of course ,  june duprez's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta-jones'  ( she even looks like jones in a way !  )  .   in conclusion ,  this is one of my all-time favorite movie  ( next to  " the adventures of robin hood "  )  and it truly deserves more attention .  it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout ,  and ,  along with  " robin hood ,  "  it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed .   stars :  ****  ( excellent )
1	it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful ,  colorful production ,  and ,  to adults ,  for a literate script ,  fine production values ,  good casting/acting ,  all bound together with a fine rozsa score .  two roughly contemporary films accomplish this-- " thief of baghdad "   ( 1940 )  and  " the adventures of robin hood "   ( 1938 )  .  some of the back story on this production is fascinating .  this production ,  commenced in england in the summer of 1939 ,  moved to hollywood ,  and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts !  the producer ,  alexander korda ,  was subsequently knighted in 1942 .  here is a unique case of the intersection of art ,  commerce ,  and politics !  by all means ,  secure a good cd of this film for your library !
1	this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure .  the genii in the bottle is a classic scene .  romantic in it's finish ,  all things turn out as they should be .  i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true .
1	let's cut a long story short .  i loved every minute of it .  a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style .  there's an evil magician ,  a pretty princess ,  a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after .  modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic .  only quibble :  the special effects are pretty dated  ( loved sabu with the djinn's foot ,  though !  )
1	a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell .  these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece !  some of the most ravishing early technicolor ,  a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu ,  the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well .  miles malleson who plays duprez father ,  the sultan of basra ,  also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose .  don't miss this one !  since posting the above comments ,  i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version-the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned-this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer .  again ,  a must see !
1	a fantastic arabian adventure .  a former king ,  ahmad ,  and his best friend ,  the thief abu  ( played by sabu of black narcissus )  search for ahmad's love interest ,  who has been stolen by the new king ,  jaffar  ( conrad veidt )  .  there's hardly a down moment here .  it's always inventing new adventures for the heroes .  personally ,  i found ahmad and his princess a little boring  ( there's no need to ask why john justin ,  who plays ahmad ,  is listed fourth in the credits )  .  conrad veidt ,  always a fun actor ,  makes a great villain ,  and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves ,  who at one point finds a genie in a bottle .  i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra ,  the father of the princess .  he collects amazing toys from around the world .  jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse .  this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time ,  but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays .  kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together .  and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful .  although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time ,  willis o'brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider .  8/10 .
1	this was usually producer alexander korda's advice on set to many of his underlings ;  the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex ,  zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out ,  pushing it to six .   for john kobal's 1987 book ,   " the top 100 movies "  ,  his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place .  a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner ,  john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture ,  but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark .   the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie's production shifted around england and america ,  eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars .  like citizen kane ,  it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love .   the special effects ,  outstanding for the time ,  are still reasonable ,  and actually hold up if you squint .  but it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions .  among them is an amusing horse ,  constructed out of a kit model ,  which ,  when a key is inserted up it's rear end ,  begins to fly .  there's also a killer toy of the six-armed goddess kali ,   ( perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her )  and a quite horrific-looking giant spider .  also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet .  but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as ,  in a superb moment of cinematic conceit ,  a djinn  ( genie )  nearly a thousand feet tall !  ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature ,  and adds an element of danger to the proceedings .  and look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle !   john justin does well as the arabic king who ,  for some strange reason ,  has an english accent and a stiff upper lip .  sabu ,  the astonishingly muscled 15year-old ,  is near-namesake abu ,  a likeably cocky thief .  after they cross paths with the evil jaffer  ( conrad veidt )  ,  justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog .  when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed's  ( justin's )  perspective ,  we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues .  in truth ,  the second half is someway the better ,  being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature .   three small songs pepper the piece ,  though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient ;  i wouldn't classify this as a musical .  it's all great fun ;  justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads ,  veidt is the boo-hiss villain ,  and abu is the youthful ,  irrepressible robber .  it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies ,  but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in .  quite commendable .
1	the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself ,  almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film .  alexander korda nearly went broke making this film .   according to the citadel film series book about the great british films ,  adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation .  but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle .   budget costs happen in us films too ,  only cecil b .  demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there .  but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film .  part of the way through the shoot ,  korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon .  he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk .  korda also finished the interiors in hollywood ,  all in time for a release on christmas day 1940 .   the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography ,  best art&set direction for a color film ,  and best special effects .  only miklos rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category .  korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place .   the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil .  the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart ,  both belonging to duprez .  this was veidt's career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser .    of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source .  beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star .  literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features .  sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant .  not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that .   the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today .  it's an eternal tale of love ,  romance ,  and adventure in any order you want to put it .
1	although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special .   if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers .  i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film .  they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers .   i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten ,  which is where a good portion of this film dwells ,  because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing .  everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end .  from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting .  it doesn't kill the film ,  but it does weaken it .   still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale ,  or even a great movie .
1	this was a favorite of my childhood - i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time .  now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own ,  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie .  we watched it last friday ,  and he liked it .  during abu's fight with the giant spider ,  my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared .   " is he gonna beat the spider ,  poppa ?  "  just watch ,  you'll see .  he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  ( eight years old )  ,  so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al-raschid might as well be oz under ozma .   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief ,  and not the grown-up king .  in fact ,  if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit ,  the king is the thief's sidekick ,  not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative ,  adventurous young boys .    it's definitely a period piece - i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve ,  my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then .  the love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented ,   " why does ahmad love the princess ?  because the narrative demands it .  "  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  ( repeatedly )  for the clueless ,  love-struck deposed king is equally improbable .  but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses ,  fifty-foot genies and the temple of the all-seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme .  the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous ,  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  ( stolen )  magic carpet ,  seeking  " some fun ,  and adventure at last !  "
1	i have seen this film several times ,  and watched it today  ( on tcm )  solely because of geraldine fitzgerald .  she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her  ( probably in  " wuthering heights "  40 or more years ago )  .  the real star in this movie ,  however ,  is paul lukas ,  and he deserved all the accolades he got .  he makes it clear ,  whether we like it or not ,  that the end justifies the means .  naziism had to be stopped ,  and anything that helped do it was good .  he gave his children a line about being bad ,  and that they should not be bad ,  but as he said earlier when conversing with adults ,  he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation .  lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation ,  and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do .   some people think his victim was a nazi ,  but i don't think so - i think he was only after the money .  his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him .   one interesting point in the film ,  and presumably also in the play ,  is the fact that muller  ( lucas )  is a german .  while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii ,  there was considerable anti-german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry .  it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time  ( maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi-soviet pact !  )  .  after all ,  the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians .  i think ,  however ,  that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later ,  after  " watch on the rhine "  was released .   the title is something of a play on words ,  as the  " watch "  is looking west ,  from germany .  in fact ,  watch am rhein was a german army marching song - used in wwii ,  but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well .  but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own  " wach am rhein "  .   all the other actors did an excellent job here ;  although bodo was too much there are children like him .  i am surprised he did not give his father's secret away .  in real life ,  he may very well have done so .
1	probably the finest fantasy film ever made .  sumptuous colour ,  spectacular sets ,  incredible ,  spot-on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood .  acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands ,  but here the poetic dialog is deftly ,  sensitively spoken  ( the humour is subtle and delightful as well )  .   doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one .  along with  " the four feathers "   ( 1939 )  ,  one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films---and one of the finest motion pictures ever made .   a true ,  compelling classic !
1	outstanding film of 1943 with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace deepened .   the usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 .   encounting treachery around them ,  lukas successfully deals with the situation .  he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he does .   davis again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn-like shedding of tears when they must part .  resolute ,  she knows that her older son ,  must follow him on his path to liberty .   a wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe .
1	words can hardly describe it ,  so i'll be brief .   " the thief of bagdad "  was my favorite movie as a child ,  and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me .  i loved this film from the first moment i saw it ,  when i was a boy of six who had started reading  " the arabian nights .  "  i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled .   rarely has so much beauty ,  magic ,  and wonder been captured on film .  sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros ,  conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar ,  and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie .  georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor .  one of the three credited directors is michael powell ,  a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films ,  including  " a matter of life and death "   ( aka  " stairway to heaven "  )  and  " the red shoes .  "  he is one of the true masters of the camera ,  right up there with david lean ,  akira kurosawa ,  and orson welles .   as with all great works of art ,  the beauty of  " the thief of bagdad "  lies in the detail .  every frame has its own magical charm .  the story never lags ,  and the characters and their actions are always involving .  here is a film that will never grow old .
1	i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess .  as any kid would be ,  i was delighted with the imagination ,  inventiveness and energy of the film .  several years later ,  i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing .  i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years .  in addition to the script ,  the production transcends the fantasy genre .  this is korda ,  the storyteller at his very best .  when you see thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time .  when you see thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece .  it`s as timeless as the story it treats .  an amazing work .   thomas mccarthy
1	this is an oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures ,  fantasy witchery and wizardly .  the malignant vizier jaffar  ( magnificently played by conrad veidt ) with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad ( attractive john justin ) who loses his throne ,  then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu ( sympathetic sabu )  .  they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess ( gorgeous june duprez )  fall in love .  but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar  ,  ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog .  the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring ,  a flying mechanic horse ,  magic bow ,  flying carpet and of course the colossal genie ( overacting performed by rex ingram )  who gives three wishes to sabu  ,  the magic eye ,  the figure of goddess kali with several hands ,  among others .   this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time .  produced by london fim's alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger ,  michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games .  the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting ,  then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado . the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography  ,  setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars  :  production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda  , cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out .  furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa .  this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs
1	despite having 6 different directors ,  this fantasy hangs together remarkably well .   it was filmed in england  ( nowhere near morocco )  in studios and on a few beaches .  at the outbreak of war ,  everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon .   notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song -  " i want to be a bandit ,  can't you understand it "  .  it remains a favourite of many people .
1	this film ,  was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that ,  unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it's quality while i grew up .  this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children ,  it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well .  the only drawback there is ,  is that one can not see past the bad' effects  ( compared to the effects nowadays )  like one could when one was a child .  i remembered nothing of those effects ,  of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film ,  when i was about eleven years old .  who then watches effects ?  one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides .  in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century .  coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film .  there is comedy ,  romance and adventure all in one ,  which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern ,  it succeeds in not being dusty and old .  all of that is mainly due to the great story ,  the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors .  in that department sabu  ( as abu )  and conrad veidt  ( as jaffar )  stand out ,  providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part .  great film and although an 'oldie' ,  definitely a goldie' .  i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday .   8 out of 10
1	abu ,  the thief of bagdad ,  helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer .   as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames ,  sir alexander korda's london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights .  replete with swords & sorcery ,  it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines .  it also is a fine piece of film making ,  featuring good acting and an intelligent script .   conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it ,  playing the evil magician jaffar .  his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days .  here is a villain worth watching .  as the boyish thief ,  sabu is perfectly cast in this ,  his third film .  while not a hero in the typical sense of the word ,  his character is certainly heroic in deed & action .   the rest of the cast do fine work .  john justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way ;  sabu gets a significant part of the action  ( when he's not transformed into a dog )  but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must .  lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra ,  coveted by two very different men .  appearing late in the film ,  massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude .   allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller .  miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra ,  forever dithering on about his mechanical toys  ( malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play & dialogue )  .  aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend .  mary morris ,  later an exceptional stage actress ,  plays the dual roles of jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed silver dancer .   the film was begun in britain ,  but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california ,  which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast .  the art direction ,  in vibrant technicolor ,  is most attractive ,  especially the fairy tale architecture in blues ,  whites & pinks .   *************************  born sabu dastagir in 1924 ,  sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore's stables when he was discovered by korda's company and set before the cameras .  his first four films  ( elephant boy-1937 ,  the drum-1938 ,  the thief of bagdad-1940 ,  jungle book-1942 )  were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed .  after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career ,  but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films ,  black narcissus  ( 1947 )  being the one great exception .  his final movie ,  walt disney's a tiger walks  ( 1964 )  was an improvement ,  but it was too late .  sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 ,  only 39 years of age .
1	the story-line of  " the thief of bagdad "  is complex ,  owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together .  the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points . the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas .  he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar's deeds and hate him .  he is imprisoned by jaffar ,  where he meets abu the young thief .  the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra .  there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by .  ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden .  he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss .  then he is captured .  when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself ,  ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog .  jaffar then asks for the princess's hand ,  and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra .  the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace ,  accompanied by abu as his dog .  the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her .  so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog ,  in hopes the prince can rouse her .  he does awaken her .  she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad ,  but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard .  she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms ,  on his promise to restore ahmad's sight and turn abu back into a thief .  the princess sees a vision of ahmad ;  he is in a boat ;  jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island .  abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle .  abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel ,  then corks him in again .  for freeing him ,  he gets three wishes .  his first is for sausages .  in the meanwhile ,  the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar ;  but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy ,  one of whose six arms stabs him to death .  abu makes a second wish ,  to find ahmad .  the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all-seeing eye .  abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye ,  battling a giant spider ,  then scaling the goddess's statue .  abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees ahmad in a canyon .  he has the genie take him to ahmad .  ahmad uses the eye to see the princess .  she smells a flower and forgets everything at once .  abu wishes they were in bagdad ,  but the genie laughs and leaves ;  jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him ,  omitting mention of ahmad .  ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess ,  but jaffar smashes the 'eye' .  abu finds himself in the  " land of legend "  ,  where the old men who rule want to make him their king .  he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead ,  to hurry to save ahmad and the princess .  the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner ,  using his bow from the flying carpet ,  to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution .  jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse ,  but another shot from the bow finishes him .  ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess ;  but when he tries to make abu his vizier ,  the young thief refuses ,  saying that what he wants is adventure ,  not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be .  this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda .  the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director ,  while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography .  the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell ,  with tim whelan ,  alexander korda ,  william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating .  the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong ,  oliver messel and marcel vertes .  the production ,  apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors ,  i claim is dominated by two other elements ,  the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar .  rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent ,  plus his usual intelligence and power .  june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima ,  and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan .  as ahmad ,  john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some ;  he is memorably good in his winning role .  this film has a spaciousness about it that is found ,  i assert ,  in other korda works also .  its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets ,  costumes and set-design elements .  this is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time ,  worthy to be enjoyed over and over .
1	i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once .  the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious :   " you sons of a thousand fleas "  .   it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3 : 00 am once and it had just started .  tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work .   10/10
1	-the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful ,  but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad .  the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with ,  but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her .  jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog .  this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa ,  restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess .  during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds ,  a giant spider that's really hungry ,  and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen .   -this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses ,  genies ,  flying carpets ,  and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs .  it doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time .  the production designs are just stunning in this movie .  from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter .  even though this movie is over 40 years old ,  the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema .  the music and songs are also well done .  anyone who sees it will no doubt hail ,   " i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas "  as one of the great musical moments in movies .  i'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie .   -what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like  " two towers "  and  " silent hill "  .  way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place .  one of my favorite shots in  " two towers "  is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates ,  the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor ,  and that's what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie .  they're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings .   -it's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of  " aladdin "  got their inspiration .  the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet .  it's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that i'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie .  i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it's amazing .  that's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time .  sure ,  the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break .  not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard .   -if you ever wanted to see a live action version of  " aladdin "  then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea .
1	the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies .  it is exciting without gore ,  it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless .  the casting couldn't have been better .  rex ingram made me believe in genies .  and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar .  he set the bar very high .    .  . i watch this movie at least twice a year .  .  . and never tire of it .  this film is an adventure for all ages .  . no-one too old to enjoy it .  the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time .  .  . i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u . s .  was just about to enter wwii .  conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying  " evilness "  a few years later in  " casablanca .  "  and korda teamed up , i believe ,  with justin and dupree again in  " the four feathers "  .  .  .  . great film-making !
1	this movie had an interesting cast ,  it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job .  im glad we have b grade movies like this one ,  the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it ,  you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot .  i like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station .  arnold vosloo and michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation .  this was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future .
1	an utterly beautiful film ,  one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do ,  in thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time .  by the '90's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again .   idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out ,  but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne .  after escaping with a little thief played by sabu ,  ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures  ( although apparently not enough for sabu !  )  and love not only conquers but annihilates everything .  the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 ,  but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later .  anyway ,  if i'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies ,  flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects !  favourite bits :  the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall's suitably romantic song ;  the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact ,  the stunning colours throughout ;  sabu and rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale .  conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever ,  this and casablanca ,  and then died .  john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers ,  both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted ,  but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions :  only pure love mattered .   there's a couple of mildly violent images in it ,  but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message ,  it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer .  one of my top 10 film favourites ,  i can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time .
1	the thief of bagdad is a treasure .  first and foremost ,  it is a good story .  though my four children's primary exposure to this tale ,  the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights ,  comes from the disney corporation ,  the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end .  the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability .  sabu ,  who plays the young thief ,  abu ,  also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal ,  judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say ,   " he's c-u-t-e !  "    in 1940 ,  the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects .  today ,  of course ,  those effects seem very dated  (  " look ,  it's barbie flying through the air ,  "  declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying )  .  yet they fit into the story well .  the film is ,  after all ,  over 60 years old .  the effects fit with the script .  furthermore ,  what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years .  one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode to see this .  in that ,  it was quite an achievement .   this qualifies as a family film ,  though there are a few stabbings near the end .  the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation .   all in all ,  a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment ,  or for the historical value of the effects .  i recommend it .
1	i grew up with this as my all-time favorite film .  the special effects are incredible for the era ,  and won awards .  i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday .  it is simply a great ,  timeless adventure .  the music is by miklos rosza ,  who is cinema history's best .  sabu is the thief .  conrad veidt is the grand villain .  i have a copy within reach ,  for the next trip down memory lane .  whoa there !  rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle !
1	i first discovered alexander korda's  ( 1940 )  fantasy ,  the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as  " the wonder show of the century !  "  both korda technicolor films ,  the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program .  the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films .  the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful !  the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made .  as the years passed ,  it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in .  true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950's .  both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video .  but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor .  the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice ,  but not as it should be .  now comes the m-g-m dvd  ( 3 dec 2002 )  issue .  the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning !  !  !  it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once ,  i watched it a second time .  the only  " extras "  are a spanish dubbed version ,  sub-titles in both english & spanish ,  and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer .  thank you m-g-m for this exceptional dvd release .  now ,  one can only hope that korda's four feathers and a restored version of korda's jungle book  ( to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation )  will soon follow on dvd .
1	three flash-backs introduce the main characters  ( abu ,  jaffar ,  and the princess )  who will interact with ahmad ;  three are the songs ,  each linked to those same characters .  three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'time' ,  in his declaration of love to the princess ,  answering her three questions at their first of three meetings .  so strong is the impression he causes ,  that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys :  deceit ,  hypnosis ,  and memory erasing .  yet ,  jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman :  the whip ,  the power ,  and the sword .  three is the number of flying entities :  the mechanical-horse ,  the genie ,  and the the genie and the magic carpet .  the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters ;  three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges ,  and three are his considerations about human frailty ,  before he departs .  abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn  ( armed guards ,  giant-spider ,  and giant-octopus )  .  three are the instruments of justice :  the magical eye that shows abu the future ,  the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess ,  and the bow-and-arrow to execute jaffar .  there's magic in the number three ,  and there is magic in this movie .
1	like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot ,  plot and more plot :  it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life ,  then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present ,  where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come .   ( it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first .  )  like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle-eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work .  a freed genie ,  a beautiful princess ,  a flying carpet ,  fantastic mechanical toys ,  sea voyages ,  a crowded marketplace ,  a wicked vizier ,  jewels  .  .  .  i don't know why it all works ,  but it does .  everything is just so beautiful .  the sets are beautiful .  june duprez is beautiful .  rozsa's score is especially beautiful .  as usual ,  it sounds hungarian ;  but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way .
1	" the thief of bagdad "  is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar  ( conrad veidt )  .  he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad ,  and a gorgeous princess from her father .  .  .   he falls victim in the end ,  as all tyrants do  ( in books and legends )  to love and of the common man whom he ignored ,  here embodied by the little thief  ( sabu )  .   the armies of good and evil ,  black and white ,  are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms .  .  .   the script is poetic ,  simply and very beautiful .  .  .  the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds ,  attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror .  .  .   the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes ,  and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues .  .  .   for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before ,  while through its use of color ,  it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before .  .  .   with flying carpet and flying white horse ,  with a giant genie  ( excellently played by rex ingram )  ,  with evil wizards ,  and with the good acting of sabu and veidt ,   " the thief of bagdad "  captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights .  .  .    the 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale !
1	the story of the boy thief of bagdad  ( as it was once spelled )  has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924 ,  who starred douglas fairbanks in the first ,  silent ,  rendering of  " thief of bagdad ,  "  to less imposing ,  more recent attempts .  the best ,  however ,  remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling ,  magical panoply of top quality special effects .  those effects still work their charm .   no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief ,  abu ,  john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch ,  ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier ,  jaffar ,  played by a sinister conrad veidt .  the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram .   ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent ,  he and the boy ,  abu ,  suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates .  ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt .  their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work .   two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl :  lawrence w .  butler and tom howard .   ( howard ,  incidentally ,  did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film .  both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry .  )   duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting .  justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses .  sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good .  for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind .  still ,  i don't think anyone under eight ought to see  " thief of bagdad .  "   this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present .  it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them .    " thief of bagdad "  is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases .  this is one of the best of its kind .   9/10 .
1	i have to agree with mr .  caruso jr lanza , s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it .  see the film you'll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house .  someone says pavarotti i say mario lanza . as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring  .
1	watch on the rhine started as a broadway play by lillian hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on broadway at a time when the soviet union was still bound to nazi germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in august of 1939 .  so much for the fact that hellman was merely echoing the communist party line ,  the line didn't change until a couple of months later .  lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work .   the play watch on the rhine ran from april 1941 to february 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from broadway to repeat their roles frank wilson as the butler ,  eric roberts as the youngest son ,  lucile watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain george coulouris and paul lukas .   lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an oscar ,  a golden globe ,  and the new york film critics for best actor .  probably if the tony awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well .  the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against ,  humphrey bogart for casablanca ,  gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls ,  mickey rooney in the human comedy ,  and walter pidgeon for madame curie .  every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was .  lukas's nomination is usually the kind the academy gives to round out a field .   jack warner knew that which is why mady christians did not repeat her broadway part and the role of lukas's wife was given to bette davis .  davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her ,  but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it .  it's the same reason she did the man who came to dinner ,  a much lighter play than this one .   davis is the daughter of a late american supreme court justice who married a german national back in the weimar days .  after many years of being vagabonds on the continent of europe ,  davis lukas ,  and their three children come to america which has not yet entered the european war .  they're made welcome by lucile watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren .   the fly in this ointment are some other house guests ,  a friend of davis's from bygone days geraldine fitzgerald and her husband who is also from europe ,  a rumanian diplomat and aristocrat george coulouris .  coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects lukas's anti-fascist background .    his suspicions are quite correct ,  it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become .  lukas fought in spain on the republican side and was wounded there .  his health has not been the same since .  his family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes .  those decisions affect all the other members of the cast .   adding quite a bit more to the broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was dashiell hammett who was lillian hellman's significant other .  coulouris playing cards at the german embassy was a hammett creation with such loathsome types as henry daniell ,  kurt katch ,  clyde fillmore ,  erwin kalser and rudolph anders .   coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account runmanian count .  he was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after stalingrad .   lucile watson was up for best supporting actress in 1943 ,  but lost to katina paxinou in for whom the bell tolls .  dashiell hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for best picture to that other anti-fascist classic ,  casablanca .    though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times ,  watch on the rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .
1	the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza .  he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer ,  paired with dorothy kirsten ,  soprano of the metropolitan opera .  indeed ,  i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso  ( check a'vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini )  .  the mgm art and music departments also did a good job .  this movie could be perfect ,  were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth ;  we see that she is trying her best ,  dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable .  lanza deserved a better leading lady ,  and blyth should stick to less demanding productions .  also notice that ms .  kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza ,  giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano .
1	an american woman ,  her european husband and children return to her mother's home in  " watch on the rhine ,  "  a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman ,  and starring paul lukas  ( whom i believe is repeating his stage role here )  ,  bette davis ,  lucile watson ,  george coulouris ,  geraldine fitzgerald ,  and donald woods .  an anti-fascist ,  a worker in the underground movement ,  many times injured ,  and wanted by the nazis ,  kurt muller  ( lukas )  is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law .  but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests  ( coulouris )  is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out .   great performances abound in this film ,  written very much to put forth lillian hellman's liberal point of view .  it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released ,  as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes .  the movie's big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in  " casablanca .  "  humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick ,  but lukas is transcendent as kurt .  the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching ,  just to mention one scene .   though this isn't what one thinks of as a bette davis movie ,  she gives a masterful performance here as kurt's loyal and loving wife ,  sara .  her acting tugs at the heart ,  and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender .   the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions .  lillian hellman is not everyone's cup of tea ,  but unlike  " the little foxes ,  "  she has written some truly sympathetic ,  wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers .  highly recommended .
1	this is a most handsome film .  the color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the metropolitan opera house in brilliant color .  other indoor scenes at various mansions ,  etc are equally brilliant .  as for the music ,  what more can be said other than that lanza's voice was at its' peak as he sang so many of the worlds' best known and beloved arias .  the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice blends with that of lanza in delightful harmony .  of course ,  hollywood took their customary liberties with the life story of caruso .  there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events .  for example ,  the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth .  there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him .  these web sites can be located by using any good search engine .  there are also several books available concerning his life history .  but ,  the fictional story line does nothing to mar this beautiful film .  the voices of lanza ,  kirsten ,  and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie .  enjoy ,  i know that i sure did .
1	mario lanza ,  of course ,  is  " the great caruso "  in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth ,  dorothy kirsten ,  eduard franz and ludwig donath .  this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary ,  world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today .   the film is opulently produced ,  and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza ,  kirsten ,  judmila novotna ,  blanche thebom ,  and other opera stars who appeared in the film .  if you're a purist ,  seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from  " lucia "  will strike you as odd - even if caruso's wife dorothy just had a baby girl .  also it's highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia ;  the role lay too high for him .   in taking dramatic license ,  the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso's life .  what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire ,  yet this is never mentioned in the film .  these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in  " girl of the golden west ,  "  there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga .  the reason for that photo ?  his only shirt was in the laundry .  he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company  ( later rca victor )  .  he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake .   instead ,  the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha ,  which never happened .  he had a hemorrhage during  " l'elisir d'amore "  at the met and could not finish the performance ;  he only sang three more times at the met ,  his last role as eleazar in la juive .  what killed him ?  the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis .  his first role at the met was not radames in aida ,  as indicated in the film ,  but the duke in rigoletto .  so when it says on the screen  " suggested by dorothy caruso's biography of her husband ,  "  that's what it was - suggested .  what is true is that dorothy's father disowned her after her marriage ,  and left her $1 of his massive estate .  they also did have a daughter gloria together  ( who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007 )  .  however ,  caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy .   some people say that lanza's voice is remarkably like caruso's ,  but just listen to caruso sing in the film  " match point "  -- caruso's voice is remarkably unlike lanza's .  in fact ,  from his sound ,  had he wanted to ,  caruso could have sung as a baritone .  he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes ,  further evidence of baritone leanings ;  and the role he was preparing when he died was othello ,  a dramatic tenor role ,  which lanza definitely was not .  lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another .  he made a unique contribution to film history ,  popularizing operatic music .  he sings the music in  " the great caruso "  with a robust energy ;  he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career .  his acting is natural and genuine .  ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself .   really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans ,  which are probably one and the same .
1	yes ,  be my love was mario lanza's skyrocket to fame and still is popular today .  his voice was strong and steady ,  so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso .  lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso .  having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza ,  he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza .  there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story ,  but the story is not entirely true ;  blame it on hollywood !  i used to practise singing his songs years ago ,  and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of emphysema/asthma ten years ago .  reaching the high note of be my love is not easy ;  but beautiful !
1	since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio ,  i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso .    but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro-goldwyn-mayer had mario lanza under contract .  no one else could have done it ,  i doubt whether it will ever be tried again .   and why should it .  i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen .  for his tenor voice was his life ,  his reason for being on the earth .    to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest .  caruso ,  like the man who portrayed him ,  was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline .  he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film .    his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought .  he's shown in a recording studio once late in his life .  actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became .   when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live .  but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men .  it's why both became the legends that they are .   what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza ,  a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera .  the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design .   mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso .  unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with ann blyth ,  dorothy kirsten ,  and jarmila novotna also .   though blyth sang it in the film ,  lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso .   if you're looking for a life of enrico caruso ,  this ain't it .  if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career ,  than you should not miss the great caruso .
1	the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most  " movergoers "  were stay-at-homes watching their new 7 "  motorola televisions .  almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation .  obviously today's $10 movies will dominate .  in 1951 it cost 90c to $1 . 60 at radio city ;  44c to 75c first run at loew's palace in washington dc ,  or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs .  what counts is the number of people responding to the picture ,  not unadjusted box office  " media spin .  "  the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  ( really not a great story anyway )  and threw it in the trash .  instead ,  90% of the movie's focus was on the music .  thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer enrico caruso .  the result was a wonderful movie .  too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating .  too fat to play the student prince ,  edmund purdom took his place --- with lanza's voice dubbed in ,  and with the formerly handsome and not-fat lanza pictured in the advertising .  if you want to see the great caruso ,  it's almost always on ebay for $2 . 00 or less .  don't be put off by the low price ,  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies ,  not the quality of the movie .
1	i like it because of my recent personal experience .  especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite .  the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their  " real "  lives ,  but they did enjoy themselves ,  i . e .  what they were .  the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory .  a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city ,  but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life .  many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those .  before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way ,  which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film .  before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head .  it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities .  this made the conversations between the characters interesting ,  not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas .  you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story .  the end was not quite important after all .  you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie .  movies are supposed to be enjoyable .  this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it .  i am on a journey too .  the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions .
1	jesse and celine  ( ethan hawke and julie delpy )  are two strangers on a european train .  the two come from widely different backgrounds ,  he's american and she's french ,  after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him .  during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other .  but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise .   this wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline .  written and directed by richard  ( dazed and confused )  linklater ,   " before sunrise "  never bores because of its' small cast .  in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two .  smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans .
1	amazing movie that ,  in theory ,  should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding .  instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments .  the lead characters are not perfect ,  and so relating to them as people you could know is easy .  the movie is not trying to pull laughs ,  or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance .    i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel .  a moving ,  thought provoking ,  funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's .  will soften even the hardiest heart .
1	i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good .  i was stunned .  easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life .  stunning .  brilliant ,  sweet ,  funny and full of heart .  the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing .   ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple .    the movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go .  you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them .  even the little moments just melt your heart .    this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever .  a masterpiece .
1	i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago .  having saw it twice ,  i couldn't help but missing before sunrise ,  not because the sequel was not as great ,  but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did ,  every time i finished watching one of them ,  i feel the need and yearning to see the other .  so ,  i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly ,  i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly .  the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other .  it sounds so simple ,  the growing of the chemistry ,  i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development ,  but to me - who doesn't believe in nora ephron - before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it .  when i saw it for the first time ,  about 8 year ago when i was 20 ,  i already liked it .  but ,  i didn't rate it as a  " great film "  ,  it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie ,  linklater was too smart to make it more realistic ,  it was 10 minutes too long ,  the characters was too well fabricated ,  i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations ,  etc .  etc .  .  but now ,  thanks to before sunset ,  i feel that's more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before .  i saw the elements more clearly :  jesse ,  celine ,  vienna ,  their conversations ,  everything .  how each of them are separated element by itself ,  and they have a chance to mix ,  the story is just a frame of time ,  i am no longer feel manipulated .  and the freedom that every scene has ,  as well as its refusal to be overly efficient ,  how blind i was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when i first saw it !  now ,  8 year have passed ,  the more movies i've seen ,  the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending ,  even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters's own slackers included .  the jesse and celine tale avoid that ,  maybe before sunset is a better example in this case ,  but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time ,  not a destination ,  every single scene has its own life .  i don't know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise ,  but to me ,  one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other .  before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes ,  seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine ,  the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it .  meanwhile ,  i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset ,  and celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i've seen in a beginning of a film ,  and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don't know with a sadness in me ,  no matter how beautiful paris is ,  and no matter how happy i am that they meet again .  i'm sorry that i go on this long with my limited english ,  before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts ,  and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .
1	ever since i can remember and i'm only 18 my mother and i have been and continue to watch older movies because well i find them much more rewarding in the long run  ( but hey don't get me wrong i do love the movies we have today just not as much as i love movies of the 40s and 50s )  anyways ,  now i have to say the moment i started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the tv .  of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by lucile watson .  but i loved the way betty davis and her family was portrayed .  the children .  .  . did not act like children in the slightest .  but there is good reason for that ,  having had to hid and run most of your life ,  seeing the awful things children saw those days destroyed their innocence .  so people saying  " oooo i hated how the kids acted .  .  . blah blah blah "  read between the lines and know they saw things children should not see .   paul lukas .  .  . dear paul did an amazing job !  !  !  now i know many people are mad that he go the oscar and bogie didn't but hey they both did amazing jobs so i think it could have gone either way .  but lukas' performance was so amazing that by the end of the movie i was reduced to tears .  i loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone !  !   : -d
1	i'm not even sure what to say about this film .  it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic .  to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa  " like dancing about architecture "  .  it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again .  this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write .  the ending is left open and ambiguous ,  no happy ending here ,  just mystery .  no profound life lessons ,  just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings .  .  .  .  .  .  romantic love .   10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
1	i must admit that at the beginning ,  i was sort of reticent about watching this movie .  i thought it was this stupid ,  little ,  romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him .  i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script ,  since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie .  still ,  i watched it !  and i was amazed .  .  .  " before sunrise "  is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way ,  wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth ,  we are sentenced to death ,  or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity ,  or that ,  we ,  humans ,  can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales .    the ending was wonderfully chosen  ( we do not know if they will meet again in six months ,  at six o'clock ,  in vienna's station )  -in our optimism ,  we sincerely hope so .  the actors acted in a very good manner ,  so ,  that ,  i began to believe that i ,  myself could live a love-story just like this .
1	american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa .  on the train he met a french girl celine .  although they met the first time ,  they talked like good friends .  when the train stopped at vienna ,  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna .  then the romantic story unfolded .   at first they were cautious .  the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store .  they peeked at each other ,  though their eyes did not contact .  after in-depth conversation ,  they relationship became close .  then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend .  their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words .   love is a strange thing .  when you really want it ,  it will not come as you wished .  love needs mutual understanding .  without it ,  love will not last long .  spiritual harmony is the most important for love .   excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie .   one of the best romance movies .  9/10
1	the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people . presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart . a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions . the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation .  the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed .  ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch .  a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love .  by far the most romantic ( at least one of them )  movie of all times .
1	my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together .  .  . which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism .  .  .  and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships !  as a lot has been written about the movie already ,  it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved .   i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs .  .  .  the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with .  .  .   on the plot front  ,  making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish .  .   i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor  ,  the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind .  what the actors bring out is what becomes of them  .  .  right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify .  .  .  to become the character ,  the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story .  .  . here both the actors do just the right job !  kudos .  .  !  !  ! and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful !
1	i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of  " before sunrise "   ( 1995 )  and  " before sunset "   ( 2004 )  ,  and saw both films in a row ,  without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately .  after sleeping it over ,  i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter ,  and i shall explain why .   before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ,  ethan hawke  ( reality bites ,  dead poets society )  ,  only 25 at the time of the film's release ;  and julie delpy  ( the three colors trilogy )  ,  then 26  ( although looking much younger )  .  he is a promiscuous american writer ,  touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend ;  she is a young french student ,  on her way home to paris .  they meet on the budapest-vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together .  the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna ,  exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love .   the film has 1990's written all over it :  back then ,  technology was leaping rapidly ,  the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner ,  and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future .  the characters of jesse  ( hawke )  and celine  ( delpy )  ,  with all their flaws and inconsistencies  ( celine's accent ,  if by mistake or on purpose ,  was half american-half french ,  and it swinged from one spectrum to the other ,  breaking the character's credibility )  ,  were a mirror of the time .  watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement ,  acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well ,  is what really made this movie work for me .  the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while .   all in all ,  sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna ,  a well told classical romantic rendezvous ,  and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future .
1	this is a slow moving story .  no action .  no crazy suspense .  no abrupt surprises .  if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking ,  about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance ,  don't waste your time and money .    on the other hand ,  if you're into dialog ,  masterful story telling ,  thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie .  i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert ,  though ,  because the pace ,  the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood .  it's truly fantastic .  i really mean that .   ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but ,  thankfully ,  the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural ,  warm and tender .  they act and feel each other out from the very beginning ,  making you feel as an intruder .   in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner .  i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence .  still it did not ruin the movie .   the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power .   bottom line :  the movie's flow is slow .  the dialog is fascinating .  the story builds gently ,  systematically and substantive .  the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding .
1	after a chance encounter on the train ,  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna ,  discussing life and love .  the primary reason to see  " before sunrise ,  "  is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines .  as  " celine ,  "  this sexy ,  brainy ,  soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties .  risking overstatement ,  celine is practically the ideal woman ,  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural ,  unpretentious ,  introspective ,  and selflessly loving .  we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak ,  for her sincere ,  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating .  further ,  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .    if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie ,  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar .  ethan hawke as  " jessie "  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob ,  sort of a maynard g .  krebs of the nineties .  attempting to appear detached and nonchalant ,  he sort of drags himself through certain shots .  his pants fit poorly ,  his tee shirt is coming untucked ,  his wavy dark hair  ( his most attractive feature )  needs a good washing ,  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee .  nevertheless ,  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around europe ,  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine .  his oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine ,  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation .  when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence ,  we know he is getting somewhere .    after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes ,  bars ,  and silly diversions ,  they agree that because they may never see one another again ,  they should make the most of it .  jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass ,  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .    given his boundless luck in the romance department ,  it is especially irksome when jessie ,  as the very definition of a naive jerk ,  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp .  he contents himself with a half-baked plan ,  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu ,  to reunite at the same spot in half a year .  when the appointed time comes ,  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another ,  perhaps even married and pregnant .  for whatever reason ,  she probably won't show ,  while jesse ,  who ends up working at target or  ( if he's lucky )  the local library ,  will go back to vienna ,  desperate to see her again ,  only to wind up alone .   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion ,   " before sunrise "  is a beautiful movie .  i highly recommend both it and the sequel ,   " before sunset .  "
1	when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening ,  i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it .  i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended .  i ,  on the other hand ,  felt completely the opposite .  i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else .  people i talked to said there was too much talking !  plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters .  i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused .  they also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy or sad .  this disgusts me .  nobody wants to be challenged anymore ?  ?  ?  and as for the ending  ( and i don't want to be a spoiler )  ,  i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again .  it's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny .  it's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people .  but it certainly spoke to me .  give it a chance !  be patient with it !  richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna .  watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters .  as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass .  it's very intimate .  plus ,  ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life .  they must have improvised during some parts and it works well .  they have a great chemistry in their roles .  their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses .  i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr .  linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made .  it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much .  bravo for romance !  !  !
1	this movie is intelligent .  that is ,  more than most other movies ,  it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it .  the story also relies heavily on dialogue .  it has some parallels to lost in translation ,  although before sunrise is much brighter ,  somehow less abstract ,  and simply a lot better .   the script ,  the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic .  the actors play absolutely brilliantly .  rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together .   the dialogue moves into very personal issues ,  with the risk of becoming a little over the top .  it does ,  however ,  stay on the right side almost all the time ,  although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing .  balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors .  sometimes ,  it yields great results ,  and overall this movie is simply stupendous !  only very ,  very rarely is  " love "  in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic .  every time that is achieved ,  the result is fantastic .  i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect .  she still looks stunning in this film ,  12 years after .   this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss .  one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s !
1	before sunrise has many remarkable things going on ,  almost too many to fit into one review like this ,  but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties ,  maybe even in all of contemporary cinema ,  to be observant not about love ,  per-say ,  so much as it's about a human connection .  how does one fall in love at first sight ?  no one does ,  at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film .  and *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection ,  of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time .  linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie ,  a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna ,  and on the way there start to talking about things ,  at first arbitrary ,  then personal  ( jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather )  .  jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town' ,  in vienna ,  until his plane the next morning .   before sunrise gives jessie and celine ,  in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance ,  and in a sense is about the act of having conversations ,  of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another .  here it's often about relationships and commitments ,  as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential ,  or seemingly so ,  and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities .  we hear confessions of desires for other loves ,  or what weren't really loves ,  of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life ,  of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form ,  or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul  ( i loved the bit about the quakers in the church )  ,  and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism .  jessie may be more responsible for that last part ,  but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself ,  just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives .   meanwhile ,  it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles ,  where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode ,  but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film ,  which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one ,  one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere .  the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter ,  only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other ,  where sweet asides are actually acceptable  (  " i have to tell you a secret "  ,  jessie says ,  and then leans in for a kiss ,  ho-ho )  ,  or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way .  i loved the scene with the poet ,  where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal ,  or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share ,  but really are seeing them do it first-hand .  all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future .  .  .   featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness ,  however self-contained ,  as it may lead into something more .  who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone ,  if only for less than 24 hours ,  and be that much more attached than a married couple ?  this is perhaps linklater's thesis ,  but there's more to it than just that .  it's a very dense film ,  and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly .  one scene especially ,  which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend .  a+
1	this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i've ever seen .  closely followed by none other than  " before sunset "  ,  which technically isn't another movie at all ,  since it's about the same two people and the same romance .   this is  " love "  in the real world .  ok ,  that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie .  reading the other reviews ,  it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog-based movies as well .  and this is what makes  " before sunrise "  so good .  the dialog is perfect .  it's so real ,  so engaging and funny .  it's hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love ,  'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time .   my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop ,  where they pretend to phone their best friends ,  with the other pretending to be said best friend .  it's perfect .  brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life .   i must say that if you have a choice ,  do watch  " before sunrise "  before watching  " before sunset "  .  if like me ,  you watched  " sunset "  first ,  it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show .   once again ,  the greatest romantic movie in my books .  wonderful acting ,  excellent script ,  and beautiful locations .  young love ,  at it's best .
1	richard linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies .  julie delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train ethan hawke .  the dialogue  ( and there is oodles of it )  is sometimes meandering and overly precious ,  but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic ,  intellectual ,  and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing ,  touching and insightful moments .
1	sweet and charming ,  funny and poignant ,  plot less but meaningful ,   " before sunrise "   ( 1995 )  ,  the third movie of richard linklater ,  is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love ,  is in love ,  or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it .  it is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers ,  their parents and even grandparents .  it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects ,  car chases ,  or long and steamy sex scenes .  two young people in their early 20s ,  two college students  ( american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne )  meet on a train .  they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking ,  they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night .  they talk and fall in love .  that's it ,  that's the movie .  it could've been boring and silly but instead ,  it is a lovely ,  believable ,  clever ,  and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing  ( at least ,  for this viewer )  .  high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters ,  superb writing ,  always interesting and witty dialogs ,  two awesome performances ,  and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is .  julie delpy ,  who looks like a botticelli's angel ,  is great in portraying smart ,  independent ,  and incredibly attractive young woman .
1	first let me say that before sunrise ,  like all movies ,  is not a movie for all tastes .  it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact ,  but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people .  for me ,  like most folks here ,  before sunrise struck a deep chord in me ,  i was truly stunned ,  moved ,  inspired by it .  this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing .  it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine .  it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it .   the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other .  it is very intelligent and inspiring ,  not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine's discussions ,  but rather the little nuances ,  the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other .  it captures an honest ,  romantic ,  yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu ;  it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world .  and what happens after that night is open for debate ,  but i never doubt that they won't each other again .   the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie .   see it and it may change your way of life .
1	i watched this movie 10 years ago .  and have watched it on video an average of once a year since .  it's the type of movie that's timeless ,  because the themes are universal ,  yet the stories and conversation are so personal .  it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll ,  despite the fact that there are ,  really ,  just two  ( very involving )  characters .  this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy ,  who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine .  this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv ,  and now ,  the phenomenon is rampant !  i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space ,  and makes you think ,  however jaded you may be ,  that you are one of those characters .  it also made me want to ride the train around europe !  i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie .  maybe that speaks about myself ,  my friends ,  or just the sheer genius of this movie .
1	there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime ,  but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives .  these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore .  we don't always even know their names ,  as we are never presented to each other ,  and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are .  it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such ,  because reuniting might spoil fond memories ,  or we don't know do they .  we are too afraid to check that out .   the movie 'before sunrise' just caught me watching it .  i never had intention to watch it through ,  but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting ,  i gave a look for the rest of the film .  i didn't know what to expect from it ,  but nor did the young couple .  they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate .  i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through .  it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives .
1	if you are a traveller ,  if there is a fire burning into your heart ,  if you'd call  " home "  every place on earth ,  but none of them can give you enough ,  if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there ,  see this movie and you'll find out a little ,  but wonderful ,  piece of life sitting next to you .
1	many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with  " the mortal storm "  or  " casablanca "  .  everyone is entitled to compare films they choose ,  but the similarities of  " the mortal storm "  and  " watch on the rhine "  are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut ,  while the main comparative point brought out with  " casablanca "  is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science ,  because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar .  it does not strike me as totally wrong .  lukas had a good career in film  ( both here and in england - he is the villain in  " the lady vanishes "  )  ,  and this performance was his best one .  bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine  ( for instance ,  he was ignored for sam spade in  " the maltese falcon "  and roy earle in  " high sierra "  two years earlier ,  both of which were first rate performances ,  and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c .  dobbs in  " the treasure of sierra madres "  ,  the writer/murder suspect in  " in a lonely place "  ,  and captain philip francis queeg in  " the caine mutiny "  afterward - he got it for charley in  " the african queen "  )  .  i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs ,  but it did not happen .  but lukas was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career .  few can claim that .   to me the film to look at with  " watch on the rhine "  is based on another play/script by hellman ,   " the searching wind "  .  they both look at america's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s .   " the searching wind "  is really looking at the whole inter-war period ,  while  " watch on the rhine "  ,  set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii ,  deals with a few weeks of time .  therefore it is better constructed as a play ,  and more meaningful for it's impact .    the film has many good performances ,  led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-nazi fighter/courier ,  davis as his loyal wife  ( wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play's activities )  ,  coulouris as the selfish ,  conniving ,  but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck ,  lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald  ( as coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife )  ,  and kurt katch ,  who delivers a devastating critique  ( as the local embassy's gestapo chief )  about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis .  it has dialog with bite in it .  and what it says is quite true .  it also has moments of near poetry .  witness the scene ,  towards the end ,  when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis ,  and says ,   " the new world has left the scene to the old world "  .  hellman could write very well at times .   given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films .
1	i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago ,  but its concept interested me when i heard it :  an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking .  it sparked my interest ,  but i never expected it to be this great .  before sunrise is a masterpiece ,  and it's also one of the most romantic films on record .  to my surprise ,  it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s .  it's impossible to really talk too much about it ,  since there is no real plot ,  so to speak  ( although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about ;  it is sort of like my dinner with andre ,  where there is a conversation ,  but it's not just the conversation that matters )  ,  but let me just say ,  see it .  see it !
1	it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other .  ethan hawke  ( jesse )   " tape "  '01 and julie delpy  ( celine )   " er "  94 tv series  ( nicole )  .  this gal and guy ,  will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years .  jesse and celine have great conversation ,  and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them .  i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film ,  you will feel the same way .
1	" before sunrise "  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever .  dialog and acting are great .  i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts .  of course ,  the romantic vienna ,  introduced in the movie does not exist  ( you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night )  and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night ,  either  ( especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in vienna )  .  but that's not the point .  the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic .  although ,  nothing ever really happens ,  the movie never gets boring .  the ending is genuinely sad without being  " titanic "  or something .  even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film !  i'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer .  the first part is perfect as it is ,  in my opinion .
1	i want céline and jessie go further in their relationship ,  i want to tell them that they were made for each other ,  that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other .  their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached .  this is about love but not stupid things like in  " notting hills "  or those kind of movie .  this is life and i did believe in them ,  i did believe they were falling .  .  .  this was so clever and touching .  i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there .  .  .  i want to go to vienna .  i want to see them as soon as possible again .   i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake ,  a concept ,  but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere ,  somehow and some when ,  something could really happen .   i'm french and didn't know very well july delpy despite kieslowski  " three colors  :  white "  .  .  .  now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting .   i saw  " before sunset "   ( the sequel in paris )  a few days before i saw  " before sunrise "  and their is no matter .  they are both masterpieces .  proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings .  i'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best .   franck in france
1	while traveling by train through europe ,  the american jesse  ( ethan hawke )  and the french celine  ( julie delpy )  meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria .  on the next morning ,  jesse returns to united states of america ,  and celine to paris .     " before sunrise "  is one of my favorite romances ,  indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen .  it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline ,  but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect ,  and the dialogs are stunning .  the direction is amazing ,  transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer .  i have just completed my review number 1 , 000 in imdb ,  and i choose  " before sunrise "  for this significant number because it is a very special film for me .  i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar ,  with such a magnificent screenplay ,  direction and performances .  yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time ,  and i still love it .  my vote is ten .   title  ( brazil )  :   " antes do amanhecer "   (  " before sunrise "  )
1	before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation .  richard linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people .  the film depicts romance in all it's glory ,  but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples ;  and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem ,  the problem of time .  while most relationships wind down with time ,  this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out .  before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance' ,  which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders .  the story follows two people ,  jesse ;  an american and celine ;  a french girl that meet on a train into vienna .  they instantly connect ,  and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train ,  jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna .  .  .   before sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life .  this allows the characters to be free ,  and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script .  this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are ,  and not merely because they're the protagonists .  this kind of realism is hard to capture as ,  at the end of the day ,  we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life ;  but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen .  a truly great script cannot work on it's own ,  and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice ,  and although i'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke ;  on viewing this film ,  there is nothing you can do but give them both respect .  i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves ,  but when a film is this good ;  it hardly matters .   in a film like this ,  it is the writing that's the most important thing ,  and contained within the script are several observations about life ,  most of which i personally could relate to .  this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters ,  but it also manages to expose what true love is ,  along with several other aspects of life .  the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing .  everyone is different ,  and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people .  there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates ;  and that's the case with the musings in this script .  adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna .  the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat ,  energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location .   before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating .  richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema ;  a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental .  before sunrise is what it is .  and what it is ,  is pure cinematic brilliance .
1	this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made .  while  " rebel without a cause "  and  " say anything "  deliver nice portrayals ,  this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences .  this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance .  you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people .  you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine ,  and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it .  this movie is mostly all dialogue -based .  but ,  every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing .  what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is .  how in all that conversation ,  while often having no real bearing on anything critical ,  you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other .  this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone .  and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe .  this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random .  and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place .  it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests .  and no matter how many times i watch this film ,  i don't think i will ever tire of that .
1	this movie is not about entertainment ,  or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time .  this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god .  one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie .  we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie .  there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed .  god's love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal .  there is the love in a marriage .  while the main character grapples with his wife's disease ,  he realizes through god's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine .  he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated .  finally ,  you have the love of child and parent .  the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear .  dear friends ,  love is not love unless it comes from god ,  because god is love and love comes from god .  talk to someone and let them know you love them .  love does no good unless it is given to another .  i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it .  amen !  !
1	forget the campy 'religious' movies that have monopolized the television/film market .  .  .  this movie has a real feel to it .  while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws ,  it also has that message of forgiveness ,  and overall good morals .  however ,  i did not like the lighting in this movie .  .  .  for a movie dealing with such subject matter ,  it was too bright .  i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie ,  which is almost an unforgivable sin ,  but the recognizable cast ,  and their performances counteract this oversight .   definitely worth seeing .  .  .  buy the dvd .
1	this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today .  as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of alzheimer's or who are in the formative stages ,  i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease .  the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle .  casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line .
1	lillian hellman ,  one of america's most famous women playwrights ,  was a woman with a mission .  her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country .  in her memoir ,  she recounts her trip to the then ,  soviet union ,  as she was intrigued with the so called successes achieved by that system .   " watch on the rhine "  must have come as a result of those years .  the left wing in america ,  as all over the world had an issue with the rise of fascism ,  not only in europe ,  but in japan as well .    " watch on the rhine "  was a play produced on broadway eight months before the pearl harbor attack by the japanese .  in it ms .  hellman was heralding america's entrance in world war ii .  the adaptation is credited to ms .  hellman and dashiell hammett ,  her long time companion .  as directed for the screen by herman shumlin ,  the film was well received when it premiered in 1943 .   we are introduced to the muller family ,  when the film opens .  they are crossing the border to the united states from mexico .  they are to continue toward mrs .  muller's home in washington ,  d . c .  ,  where her mother ,  fanny farrelly ,  is a minor celebrity hostess .  the mullers ,  we realize are fleeing europe because of the persecution there against the opponents of the advancing totalitarian regime in germany .  in fact ,  we thought ,  in a way ,  the mullers could have been better justified if they were jewish ,  fleeing from a sure extermination .   we find out that mr .  muller has had a terrible time in his native land ,  as well as in other places because his outspokenness in denouncing fascim .  little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-law's house that is housing one of the worst exponents of that philosophy .   the film offers excellent acting all around .  it is a curiosity piece because of bette davis' supporting role .  paul lukas ,  repeating his broadway role ,  is quite convincing as kurt muller ,  the upright man that wants to make a better world for himself and his family .  mr .  lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller ,  repeating the role that made him a stage luminary on broadway .   the other best performance is by lucile watson ,  who plays fanny farrelly ,  the matriarch of this family .  geraldine fitzgerald is seen as marthe de brancovis ,  a guest of the farrellys ,  married to the contemptible teck de brancovis ,  a nazi sympathizer ,  played by george coulouris .  beulah bondi ,  donald woods ,  and the rest of the supporting cast give good performances guided by mr .  shumlin .   the film should serve as a reminder about the evils of totalitarian rule ,  no matter where .
1	i wasn't expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you'd expect to be living next door .  they are ordinary flesh-and-blood people ,  not like the typical hollywood fare .  they face an all too common problem--debilitating illness .  but the story-line grips the heart with a powerful lesson .  casting ,  script ,  direction ,  and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story .  give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire .
1	this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption .  i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family .  well-acted and well-directed .  if there were any flaws ,  i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again .  what about all people of all cultural backgrounds ?  i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown - like in real life .  nevertheless ,  the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker .  loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
1	probably my all-time favorite movie ,  a story of selflessness ,  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause ,  but it's not preachy or boring .  it just never gets old ,  despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years .  paul lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes ,  and bette davis ,  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles ,  is a delight .  the kids are ,  as grandma says ,  more like  " dressed-up midgets "  than children ,  but that only makes them more fun to watch .  and the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling .  if i had a dozen thumbs ,  they'd all be  " up "  for this movie .
1	a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie .  it's based on a novel of the same title ,  which was equally good ,  though different from the film .  really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters .  recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent ,  spouse ,  or family member--in other words ,  everyone !   though the production isn't quite hollywood quality--no big special effects--still ,  the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it .  and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members ,  and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill .   you don't want to miss this !
1	i just watched this movie for the second time ,  and enjoyed it as much as the first time .  it is a very emotional and beautiful movie ,  with good acting and great family values .  inspiring and touching !
1	when i found the movie in the schedule for christmas ,  its title did not sound familiar to me since i have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film .  yet ,  having read the content ,  i decided to spend my christmas evening on watching the movie .  the effect surprised me totally :  i do not remember when i last saw a film in which every single moment involved me .  a vow to cherish is ,  without any doubt ,  one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise i have received from cinema .  here are some arguments of mine why i consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema .    first ,  the entire content is particularly educational .  it has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions .  is there a need for christ in our times ?  does love still matter ?  what for is there faith ?  what is the logics of burden and suffering in life ?  is there really someone by my side i can always trust ?  the movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us .   second ,  the movie is exceptionally humane .  the main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions .  is it better for kyle david denman )  and teri  ( megan paul )  to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home ?  is it better for john  ( ken howard )  to leave ellen  ( barbara babcock )  ,  his sick wife ,  and start a new happy life with julia  ( donna bullock )  ,  a woman he falls in love with ?  in fact ,  ellen no longer recognizes him .  .  .  yet ,  he decides to vow his wife eternal fidelity .  had john's rebellious brother ,  phil  ( d .  david morin )  ,  better go on his easy life although it does not bring him satisfaction or once start to think seriously of his life .  phil's prayer to god in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity .  these words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where ,  when or how they live .   third ,  the movie is a great portrayal of family ,  not very popular nowadays :  there are problems ,  yet ,  there is always something more powerful that gets these people together .  this  " something "  is love and trust .  i know that it may seem a bit idealistic .  not all families can rely on fidelity and it may not be as simple as that .  nevertheless ,  it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one .   fourth ,  the entire film focuses on people's mutual help .  if we want to live happy lives in our society ,  we must understand one thing :  we have to help one another .  alexander  ( ossie davis )  is an example of such attitude .  at the beginning of the movie ,  we see him talk to john about praying .  later ,  he helps his brother .  alexander is a kinda  " angel "  that is sent to john and his family .  isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another ?   fifth ,  the artistic features are also worth attention .  performances :  barbara babcock gives an authentic performance as ellen and although she has a difficult role ,  she does a perfect job .  consider ,  for instance ,  the moment she appears at school and badly wants to teach again .  ken howard is also memorable as the faithful husband .  picture :  the most memorable for me was the scene of john and ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves  ( autumn )  while the sunshine  ( love )  spreads everywhere .  i interpreted as a sort of symbol :  even if there is sorrow ,  this can always be illuminated by light and joy .  .  .   a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love ,  what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe .  at the end ,  i would like to quote the profound words from the movie i found very touching and hope you will also do   kyle to his uncle phil :  yes ,  he  ( john brighton )  lives according to the bible .  but nobody forces you to do so .  yet ,  according to what rules do you live ?
1	for all of you that don't speak swedish :  the swedish [original] title of this film ;   " rånarna "  translates into something in the line of  " the robbers "  .  this fact is the main problem i have with the film ,  cause it's not really about the robbers at all .  it's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies .  a regular desk job one would think ,  but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands ,  as the story goes ,  even shooting one of the robbers .  .  .  exactly :  we've seen this before .  the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the film .   what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways ,  that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story .   one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed ,  but is absent for the rest of the time ,  which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car-chases spread throughout the film .  a nice touch !  the fact that michael persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background ,  but that's something you have to neglect .   all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you .  7/10
1	even this early in his career ,  capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing .  this is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately .  the first part looks like a cinderella story ,  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune .   nonetheless ,  because of his good cast and fast pace ,  it's easy to get caught up in the clichés .  then the movie does become more original ,  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living .  the ending is very predictable but satisfying .  i also want to compliment the title-writing :  very witty and fun .
1	that certain thing is the story of a gold digger  ( viola dana )  from a tenement house .  her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers ,  but they are a loving family .  although dana's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor ,  she refuses and holds out for a millionaire .  everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy ,  but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire ,  son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain .  the two marry hastily ,  but the girl's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger .  however ,  she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own .   a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana ,  this film is a lot of fun .  dana's role is accessible ,  natural ,  and entertaining .  she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama .   the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too .  the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility .  the title cards are also incredibly clever .   if you like films like my best girl ,  it ,  or the patsy ,  you will enjoy this film .
1	but sadly due to rights issues ,  that almost certainly will never happen .  transcripts of joe bob's commentary on the sub b movies he screened are available on the internet ,  but they don't quite capture his twang inflected delivery ,  which was a real hoot .  nowadays ,  joe bob  ( real name :  john bloom )  is confined to doing the supplemental features of such classics as  " i spit on your grave "   ( featuring what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on film of all time )  ,  and jason x ,  one of the most reviled friday the 13th sequels of all time  ( the series was never the same once it left paramount )  .  all i could think when they canceled it was :   " damn ,  where else am i going to get my fill of flesh ripping ,  blonde jokes ,  and horror trivia every saturday night ?  does this mean i have to get a life now ?  "  sadly ,  it does .  but there'll always be a place in my horror hungry heart for  " monstervision .  "  long live the drive-in !
1	monstervision was a show i grew up with .  from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one ,  the only ,  joe bob briggs .  the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years ,  and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in .   without a doubt ,  the best late night television ever .  if you didn't stay up ,  you were missing out .   i know john bloom and joe bob live on ,  but i want them back where they belong .  .  . monstervision !  question .  .  . did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of  " the swarm "   ?  q :  )   long live monstervision !
1	i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993 .  i was 8 at the time ,  and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it . the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away ,  what a great decade .  anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time ,  as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films .  it was like the 90's version of chiller theater .  if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe bob's show ,  at least monstervision was more interesting and informative .  a lot of joe bob's comments and info on the films were just hilarious .  most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen .  many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci-fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell .  with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors ,  i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up ,  since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show .  i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day ,  i guess will have to wait and see .  until then  " thats great television "  !
1	i'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 .  a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie ,  and it was a who's who of the top canadian bands of the age .  we got there about 4am ,  waited in line most of the morning ,  and when the doors opened at 9am ,  we were among the first inside the gates .  we then waited and waited in the hot sun ,  slowly broiling but we didn't care ,  because the headliners were among our favourites .  at one point ,  early in the afternoon ,  i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier .  i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t-shirt .  this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day .  there's nothing reasonable ,  nor taste-determined ,  nor really anything except their fandom .  snotty of me ,  isn't it ?  so ,  i ,  in my hatred of the band ,  have denied myself the delight that is whale music .   desmond howl had it all .  it's hard to say what he's lost ,  since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains  ( the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking )  .  the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams ,  phantoms ,  and his own past ,  until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in .  .  . and ,  trite as it sounds ,  breaks him out .   canadian cinema suffers from several problems .  generally ,  a lack of money ,  as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help  ( as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian )  leads to lower production values than american or british films ,  and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like ,  well ,  not like an american film .  next ,  canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story ,  and tell it well .  third ,  they seem to think that gratuitous nudity  ( often full-frontal )  makes something artistic .  i'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies ,  especially late at night on the cbc ,  knows exactly what i'm talking about .  it's almost like a  " don't do this "  handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago .   in the 90s and 00s ,  however ,  some films  ( such as bruce mcdonald's work and the brilliant c . r . a . z . y .  )  have broken this mold ,  and managed to maintain what makes them canadian ,  while holding onto watchable production values and great stories .  whale music is such a film ,  on the surface .  deeper than just its canadian-isms ,  it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip ,  through grief and excess ,  who is redeemed by music then by love .  and that redeems even the rheostatics .   :  )
1	i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy !  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business .  .  . who are now still trying to become adults .  .  .  . no more fans , groupies , money etc .  .  . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life .  .  . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight .  .  . it is almost like they have to begin anew .  .  . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70's and 80's are going through now .  .  .  . and that's where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  ( outrageous )  .  .  . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for .  this film is a must have for folks in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands , people who knew the members ,  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in , and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie .  .  .  . sad but in a way positive .  .  .  . because of the whales .  a must see !
1	anyone who loves the rheostatics' music is going to enjoy this film .  i have some minor complaints ,  mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors  ( not maury )  who aren't really convincing in their roles ,  but i don't have time write a detailed review .  i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada :  the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader's digest version of whale music---don't watch it .  it cuts out entire scenes and subplots  ( if you can them that )  from the film .  the cbc ,  which presents most of films untouched ,  took half the guts out of whale music .  i don't know why .  it's horrible what they did to the film .  rent the video or watch it in a theatre ,  but don't watch it on cbc television .
1	i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie .  for some reason it clicked on all my levels ,  tensions in a family ,  loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with .  it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire  ( cyndy preston )  .  i also bought the sound track to this movie  ( very hard to get )  .  loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv
1	i was amazingly impressed by this movie .  it contained fundamental elements of depression ,  grief ,  loneliness ,  despair ,  hope ,  dreams and companionship .  it wasn't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music .  he finds a companion who comes with her own issues .  claire and des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst .    des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star .  yet he has musical genius .  he also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate ,  while things around him literally go to ruins .  his focus is creating his whale music ,  in fact it becomes an obsession for him .   claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay .  she finds hidden talents while being in des company .  she also finds a mutual friend that accepts her .  she learns to trust him over a period of time .   these two find love with one another .  not the mind blowing ,  sex infused kind of passion ,  but a love where friendship and understanding means more .  for two people who have been hurt ,  they find trust together .
1	a friend of mine recommended this movie ,  citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl ,  the movie's main character .  i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more ,  i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal .   this is a pretty unique work ,  the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance ,  not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue  ( whale music is just so much more ,  well ,  relaxed .  )  but instead that they both represent modern love stories .   in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians  ( for example i highly recommend hard core logo )  and this film in particular .  it has an innocent charm ,  des is not always the most likeably guy ,  but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy .
1	my first exposure to  " whale music "  was the rheostatics album of the same name ,  that i bought around 1993 .  i was reading the liner notes and the band said the album ,  which remains in a prominent place in my collection ,  was inspired by canadian author paul quarrington's book .   i picked up the book a few months later and devoured it !  an amazing read !  i have since re-read the book numerous times ,  each time finding some new element to desmond and his desire to complete the whale music .   i found the film in 1996 ,  on video .  i haven't had a lot of good experiences with canadian film ,  but this one worked for me .  the role of claire could have been cast differently ,  but overall i think that paul quarrington's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen .   maury chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius .  the movie deals with family relationships ,  love ,  and finding someone who understands .  i would strongly recommend  " whale music "  to not only music fans ,  but anyone who has ever lost something or someone ,  and tried to find their way back to the world .
1	walking the tightrope between comedy and drama is one of the toughest acts in cinema .  how do you get laughs out of other people's misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long ?   well ,  this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs ,  beautiful scenery ,  and quite a good buzz as well .  i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it ,  and marijuana illegal ,  since 'those other races' used it .  .  . undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly flaunted by populations all over the world .   an extraordinary  " dvd extra "  commentary .  .  . two of them in fact .  .  . run thru the whole movie with both the actors ,  and then again with the writers .  i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie ,  but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take .  what a hoot !  don't miss it !  9/10 stars
1	this is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide-out ,  trying to avoid being caught by parents ,  teachers ,  the police ,  etc .  .  .  the protagonist is a lady in her forties ,  living in her mansion ,  breeding orchids ,  and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her .  when he all of the sudden dies ,  she is confronted with the truth .  the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt .  she doesn't know what to do ,  until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain .  she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead .  .  .  the story is quite original ,  the performances outstanding !  i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one .  still ,  the melodramatic touch is present .  the film is typical british :  the jokes aren't vulgar ,  there is no violence involved .  it shouldn't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching 'saving grace' .  it will be so much more fun !  especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious .  i thought my jawbones would burst .  9/10
1	it may  ( or may not )  be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca  ( 10/10 role for the best actor oscar .   ( i still would have given the oscar to bogie ,  but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination ,  at least .  )  well ,  i'm glad i did check this movie out ,  because i enjoyed it immensely .  i think the movie did preach a little ,  but not only did i not mind ,  i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them .   the acting was outstanding in this movie .  i especially enjoyed paul lukas ,  lucile watson  ( rightfully nominated for an oscar )  ,  bette davis  ( wrongfully not nominated )  ,  george coulouris and ,  oddly ,  eric roberts ,  who plays the middle child .  i really enjoyed his character :  an odd-looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher .  he just cracks me up .  even the characters name  ( bodo )  is funny .    the ending ,  in which lukas's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons ,  worked for me as well .  i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did ,  and i understood why he couldn't quite explain it .  the message this movie makes is a good and noble one ,  the scenery  ( meaning the house )  is beautiful ,  and the acting is the excellent .  watch this movie if you ever get a chance .   9/10
1	this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist ,  and am i glad he did !  the blend of british humor  ( should i say ,  humour ?  )  and the reality of a lost ,  middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot .  add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot  ( those plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received )  ,  and it is a truly hilarious ,  yet touching film .  i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights !  maybe it's just my mendocino county blood ,  but the brits definitely got this one right !  !  10/10
1	this is an hilarious movie .  one of the very best things about it is the quality of the performance by each actor .  from the largest role to the smallest ,  each character is vivid ,  unforgettable and so understandable .  it can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve .
1	a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother ,   " saving grace "  seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other british comedies over the past two years .  .  . underdog is faced with adversity ,  finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him/herself in the process .   widowed and thus broke ,  grace is a master gardener ,  and is enlisted to help her friend/employee matthew grow his pot plant .  he's been doing it all wrong ,  so grace helps him out .  they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot ,  which they can both benefit from .  he enjoys smoking ,  she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage .    highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise ,  dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in  " saturday night fever "  and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb .    blethyn is always watchable ,  and you can't say that about a lot of people .  . well ,  i can't ,  anyway .  ferguson is very good ,  and tcheky karyo ,  who i liked in  " la femme nikita "  ,  is memorable .    not profoundly moving or insightful ,  but immensely entertaining ,  and at a brisk 90 minutes ,  feels like a walk with friends .  8/10 .
1	i love this film .  it's one of those i can watch again and again .  it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded .   the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller .  either would have killed the film completely .   the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor throughout .   it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes .  .  .   ( no that's not a spoiler !  )
1	yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material .  but then it doesn't try to be anything it is not .  a fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners ,  a stellar and very funny performance by peter o'toole ,  a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright .  the band's performance was on the spot ,  each one playing their role in a deft ,  comical manner .  the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely .  from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads .  a good example is the comment about the  " strange baseball-like game "  ,  well my dear american ,  that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket .  also no ,  you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window ;  it was funny how lord foxley said  " oh yes !  "  to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time  " oh no "  also referring to the money .  jeez ,  it seems that every joke must be explained to some people .  .  .  all-in-all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs !  well worth seeing .
1	charming doesn't even begin to describe  " saving grace ;  "  it's absolutely irresistible !  anyone who ventures into this movie will leave with their spirits soaring high  ( haha )  .   grace trevethyn  ( brenda blethyn )  has just lost her husband ,  but her problems are about to get a whole lot worse .  her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts .  faced with losing everything ,  she has to find out a way to get a lot of cash .  .  . fast !  she gets an idea when her gardener ,  matthew  ( craig ferguson )  asks the town-famous horticulturist to give him advice on a plant he is secretly growing .  grace immediately realizes that his plant is marijuana ,  so they decide to use her gardening skills to grow a lot of top-quality weed ,  and then sell it to pay off her outstanding debts .   the most notable quality about  " saving grace "  is its likability .  every character is extremely sympathetic ,  and ,  save for the first 20 or so minutes ,  the film is non-stop good cheer .  everyone wants a happy ending for everyone ,  even if it means turning a blind eye to some rather illegal activities .   the acting is top-notch .  brenda blethyn is one of britain's finest actresses ,  and here is why .  she turns what could have been a caricature into a fully living and breathing individual .  she's a nice lady ,  but she's not stupid .  craig ferguson is equally amiable as matthew .  he's a deadbeat loser ,  but he's so likable that it doesn't matter .  the rest of the ensemble cast fits in this category as well ,  but special mention has to go to tcheky karyo .  the french actor always has a aura of menace about him ,  and that suits him well ,  but he also has great comedy skills .   nigel cole finds the perfect tone for  " saving grace .  "  it's all about the charm .  one of the problems i have with british humor is that all the energy seems to be drained out of the film .  not so here .  the film is thoroughly likable and always amusing .  that's not to say that  " saving grace "  is just a likable movie that will leave you with a grin and a good feeling .  while this movie is not an out and out comedy ,  it does boast two or three scenes that are nothing short of hysterical .   if there's any problem with the film ,  it's that the climax is a little confusing .  the questions are answered though ,  and the ending boasts an unexpected twist .   see  " saving grace ,  "  especially when you're having a bad day .
1	i saw it last night on tv ,  and was quite delighted .    it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart ,  and believe that there is still some goodness in the world  ( all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her- the old policeman is my favourite )  ,  although you know that this story is not quite realistic .   i loved acting  ( they all seemed just as ordinary ,  common people ,  living in small picturesque english coast town )  but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has !  just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their  " tea "  !  !   perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing ,  but it didn't stop me from really ,  really enjoying the whole story !
1	" saving grace "  is never riotously funny ,  but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree .  brenda blethyn is a fine actress ,  and does a good job at portraying widower grace ,  who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts .  the supporting cast also does a fine job .  french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role .  the premise alone is appealing .  the idea of an over-the-hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough .  and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then .  of course ,  there are flat moments ,  like one where two elderly women mistaken grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work .  that was a mindless gag that didn't quite take off .  the film's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull ,  but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation .    my score :  7  ( out of 10 )
1	saving grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place .  grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts .  she could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana .  she's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors .  there's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user .  it's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff .  the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny .  it's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by english slapstick ,  and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable .
1	after her oscar-nominated turn in  " secrets & lies "  ,  brenda blethyn starred in the equally great  " saving grace "  .  and let me tell you ,  this is not the sort of movie that you find every day .   after her husband commits suicide ,  grace trevethyn  ( brenda blethyn )  discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt .  fortunately ,  she finds a way to make ends meet :  marijuana .  that's right ,  grace starts cultivating it .   every aspect of this movie was played to great effect ;  there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it .  and i sure didn't see that end scene coming !  but anyway ,  you gotta see this movie .  you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it .  if nothing else ,  it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's finances .  but of course ,  there's a lot more to it than that !
1	for muslim women in western africa ,  married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard  .  the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour ,  but equally ,  they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal ,  an attitude which of course enables it to continue .  fortunately ,  the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all ,  and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children .  what is notable  ( apart from the uplifting central story )  is how ,  in spite of their informality ,  the courts are actually pragmatically progressive ,  if a case is actually bought .  the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life-style ,  which  ( aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases )  seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america .  and while i concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part ,  this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin-english they speak .  overall ,  this is a terrific little film ,  and much more fun to watch than you might imagine .
1	this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value .  it gets quite hysterically funny at times ,  but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts .   the cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles .  how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played .  she's a true lady .  and ,  my favorite is grace's white pimp suit that she wears .   i highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud ,  who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different .
1	yet another example of what british cinema can achieve :  a simple story ,  told and acted well .  brenda blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened grace ,  ably assisted by a solid supporting cast .  the  " quirky small town "  card gets played to the hilt ,  similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british isles in recent years  ( ballykissangel ,  hamish macbeth and others come to mind )  .  like the forementioned ,  this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery ,  in this case the wet and wild cornish coast .   some viewers might find wholesale acceptance of cannabis use a bit challenging ,  others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe .  but it's an enjoyable spliff ,  to be sure .
1	a delightful gentle comedic gem ,  until the last five minutes ,  which degenerate into run of the mill british tv farce .  the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating .  despite this major plot and style flaw ,  it's worth watching for the character acting and the unique cornwall setting .  many fine little bits to savor ,  like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit card .  .  . made more piquant when we're not - quite - sure the card is not maxed .
1	i saw saving grace right after it came out on video .  since then it's become one of my favorites !  the plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment .  it's chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it .  the characters are what makes the movie so good .  they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor ,  the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind .  superb acting was done by all ,  particularly brenda blythen .  she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments .  if you're looking for a good comedy i'd definately recommend this movie !
1	this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam ,  whether financially or emotionally .  you will definitely laugh ,  which is the best medicine !   :  )  left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies ,  grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour .  even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick-flic .
1	excellent view of a mature woman ,  that is going to lose everything  ( even the pruner has a mortgage )  .  the way she gets involved into this special  " business "  ,  the innocence ,  and the true love that exists between the people of a little town ,  it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh ,  light and funny comedy .  i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore .   i love european films ,  and with movies like this one ,  my opinion grows stronger .  a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed ,  in this same genre ,  is waking ned devine .   saving grace ,  a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself .  you will love it .
1	saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon , when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun .  i mean , the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness !  it was the first movie i watched with this theme ( drugs/marijuana )  that is not really criticizing it , only making jokes about it .  grace trevethyn is a widow , who lives in a small town in u . k .  and has many financial problems because of her dead husband ,  who committed suicide since he was full of debts .  the problem is that grace ,  who imagined to have some money saved for her ,  discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things ,  specially her house that she loves so much .  she never worked before ,  and is in a tragic situation until matthew , her gardener who is very found of smoking pot ,  decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale .
1	great actors ,  an oscar nominee actress ,  stunning scenery ,  good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag  ( and thats quite big )  .  this film was brilliant .  it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were  .   . well ,  side splitting .  i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much ,  and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop' scene .  well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year ,  if not of all time .
1	i just thought it was excellent and i still do .  i'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with .  saving grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america's bride sort of movie .   saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid .  i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband's debts .   in a nutshell - a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing .  you couldn't ask for more .   7/10 .
1	sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in sweden .  a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary .  it was shown in göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto ,   " director in focus "  of the festival .  she gave a master class ,  very much appreciated ,  telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice  :  the first version got lost for good ,  so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end .  a pretty awful problem happened ,  in this case ,  to create the possibility of a very strong movie .
1	it's a bit easy .  that's about it .   the graphics are clean and realistic ,  except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d ,  but that's forgiveable .  the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games .  the sounds are magnificant .  everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic .   the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times ,  but it's the same for every platform game ,  like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64 .   i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 ,  and since then ,  i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times .
1	mario's first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible .  miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today .  this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure/platform games .
1	although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series ,  it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games .  games with this much replay value are few and far between .  plus ,  this game has so much variety .  there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do ,  and many other hidden tasks .  the game isn't very challenging ,  but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all .  once you beat it ,  you'll want to erase your game and start again .  and its just as much fun the second time ,  or third time ,  or two hundredth time .  a must own for any nintendo 64 owner ,  and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64 .
1	super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created .  it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break .  i've beaten the game 4 times ,  but i've never gotten all 120 stars .  .  .  ( i've gotten 111 )  .  .  . but i hope to achieve them eventually .  even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in ,  i loved watching my sisters play it .  now i am 13 and still play this ,  erasing games and starting over again .   the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game .  the gameplay is addictive .  the controls are great .  the levels are tough ,  but not impossible .  the bowser fights are challenging .   i would like to tell you more ,  but why don't you just get it for yourself ?  put the x-box 360 ,  ps3 ,  and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing ,  wonderful game .
1	one of the funnest mario's i've ever played .  the levels are creative ,  there are fluid controls ,  and good graphics for its time .  there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight .  sometimes the levels get frustrating ,  and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still ,  need to get more accomplished to fight a boss ,  it can be annoying .  another complaint is the camera angle ;  though it works fairly well most of the time ,  it can be a pain in certain situations .  if your a big time mario fan ;  this ones for you .  even if your not a huge fan of him ,  i'd still recommend this one .  its a big game ,  and getting what you need can take a while ,  but it's very satisfying .  good for playing in short bursts of time .  it will almost certainly hold your interest ;  it sure does hold mine !
1	when i first got my n64 when i was five or six , i fell in love with it , and my first game was super mario 64 . and i loved it ! the graphics were great for it's time , a good plot , great courses and above all , the best music i heard in a nintendo game .   i don't remember the plot completely , but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser , and mario has to rescue her . the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle . each had about five or six challnges to get the stars . there are secert parts of the castle , where you can get more stars . but of course , you have beat bowser . *i think there are three levels to beat bowser on* lets start with the characters . mario is the main character , and gets helpful advice from toad , so he is basically one of your only alliances . i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end . the main villain is bowser , and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba . the characters are really great .   next , how about the graphics ? people say gameplay is more important then the graphics , and i agree completely . but with he great plot , there are great graphics . especially for it's time . i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to super mario . bright colors , great effects and awesome sound effects . i found the graphics in the water courses very very good . next to the bowser world ones , it has the best graphics in the game .   now , the music . this is my favorite part of the game . growing up , when i played this at a young age , i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep . especially the music from jolly roger bay , which was peaceful and wonderful . there are others that are great too , especially in , once again , the worlds with bowser , are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites .   this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer , and i love it . this game gets 10/10 or ***** ( 5 ) /***** ( 5 )  go play the game !
1	or at least one of the best .  i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64 .  bowser is up to his usual shenanigans  ( yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of )  and mario must stop him again .  this game is very fun to play ,  and contains lots of nostalgia to me .  the only bad thing about it is the graphics ,  which are awful to today's standards ,  but everything else is pretty good  ( especially the little mini-games you can unlock )  it's the second best n64 game  ( the first best is conker's bad fur day )  that i recommend to any mario fan ,  or any fan of platform games .  it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day .   9/10 or :  a
1	yes ,  that's right ,  it is .  i firmly believe that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made .  it was amazing the first time i saw it ,  with its huge environments and colorful characters ,  and its amazing now .  the play control is perfect ,  the graphics are beautiful ,  and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there .  a must have for any n64 owner ,  and a reason to get an n64 for everyone else .
1	rated e   i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times . in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day ,  super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system . i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time . if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it . the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment . the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game . you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer . now you can do it in a 3d environment . super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it .   10/10
1	this game is amazing .  really ,  you should get it if you don't have it .  although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out .  i believe that this game will always be a classic .  it's just as good a super mario world or so .  when i was young ,  my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did .  it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy ,  but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential .  it's fun entertaining and challenging .  everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics ,   ( well it did come out in 1996 .  )  rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi !  !  !  nintendo is the best !
1	mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake .  when mario gets there ,  he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her !  mario must save the day again .  unlike the 2-d games ,  mario can explore anything he wants to .  he can just roam around ,  climb trees trying to look for 1-ups ,  find secrets in levels ,  and more .  you can spend four hours in one level .  no time limits .  there are 16 worlds ,  with a number of stages ,  and there are star doors ,  which you need a certain number of stars to get into .  once you get in these star doors ,  you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage .  to get to certain worlds ,  you need a number of stars to get in .  you enter the world by going through a painting .  there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay ,  i don't see how anyone could dislike this game .  it's great .  this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life .  every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64 .  banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used .  super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games .  10 out of 10 .  if you have an n64 ,  buy this game .  it's hard to find used ,  because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop .  a perfect 10 .
1	i have not read the novel ,  though i understand that this is somewhat different from it ;  the fact that i rather enjoyed this ,  coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre ,  leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book .  having not read a single word of austen's writing ,  i really can't compare this to any of her work .  what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever ,  witty ,  and well-delivered ,  as well as the biggest source of comedy in this .  this made me laugh out loud a lot ,  with perfect british and verbal material .  every acting performance is spot-on ,  and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker .  the characters are well-written ,  credible and consistent .  i did find a couple of them extremely irritating ,  however ,  and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny ,  it tended to get repeated excessively ,  and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared .  the editing and cinematography are marvelous ,  and everything looks utterly gorgeous .  plot and pacing are great ,  you're never bored .  it does end in a *really* obvious manner ,  but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer .  i can't claim that this did not entertain me ,  it did from start to finish ,  and i'd watch it again .  there is brief language in this .  i recommend this to any fan of romance stories .  7/10
1	this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in cameroun's judicial system-- policewomen ,  lawyers and judges .  despite tremendous difficulties-- lack of means ,  the desperate poverty of the people ,  multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious/ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants-- these brave ,  strong women are making a difference .   this is a rare thing-- a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind .  despite the atrocities we see in the movie ,  justice does get served thanks to these passionate ,  hardworking women .   i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states .  the more people who see this film ,  the better .
1	this is an ok adaptation ,  but not as good as the tv version .  the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley ,  particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version .  gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again ,  i preferred kate beckinsale's emma .  there are excellent support performances from toni collette ,  juliet stephenson and sophy thompson .   the script is often played too much for laughs ,  the book is a comedy ,  but there are too many set-piece gags here ,  and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent .   my biggest criticism is the scenery .  it is far too lush .  england has never been like this .  it looks like a chocolate box .  only americans would make it like this .   despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more .
1	" emma woodhouse "  gwyneth paltrow  ( shakespeare in love ,  duets )  has nothing to do with herself but painting ,  going with her friends on her chariot up and down ,  saying hello to people in town ,  and trying to match make everybody she knows .  i guess there were no movies ,  no television in those days ,  and the girls had nothing to do but gossip .  i wish she had read a little more .  i like gwyneth ,  and think that she is a lovely young woman .  she is talented ,  and in  " emma "  one has the privilege to hear gwyneth sing .  i am looking forward to seeing  " duets "  ,  where she is suppose to sing .  she is brave to speak british english with all those native britons ,  including emma thompson's sister ,   " miss bates "  sophie thompson  ( four weddings and a funeral ,  dancing at lughnasa )  .   " mrs .  elton "  juliet stevenson  ( truly ,  madly deeply )  was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991 .  gwyneth is part of the american movie royalty ,  being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow  ( st .  elsewhere )  and tony award winner blythe danner  ( the myth of fingerprints )  .  she will hopefully be around for a real long time .  lucky us !  i liked emma and also recommend it .  it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days .  favorite scenes :  emma singing and playing the piano .  i specially like it when she sings a duet .  favorite quotes :  mr .  knightley "  :  emma ,  you didn't ask me to contribute a riddle .  "  emma :   " your entire personality is a riddle ,  mr .  knightley .  i thought you overqualified .  "  miss bates :   " it left us speechless ,  quite speechless i tell you ,  and we have not stopped talking of it since .  "
1	first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd ,  it is on of my favorite movies of all time .  i have read the book ,  but i really think the movie is much better .  i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr .  knightley was an excellent chose .  he was brilliant !   it's a 10/10 movie !  !  !
1	if you have any clue about jane austen´s production ,  you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels :  marriage ,  marriage and marriage !  in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring ,  but i like austen´s characters ,  because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma .  the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow ,  she´s very good in her leading role .  also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious .
1	emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel .  i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot ,  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot .  there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing .  the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it .  of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny .  gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma .  the film also stars toni collette ( who has okay but has been much better )  ewan mecgreger ( who has also been better but he is still very good here )  alan cumming ( who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here )  and jeremy northam ( who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle ,  even if that was not what it needed )  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching .
1	a slight ,  charming little movie to be sure ,  but a superbly-crafted one .  gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent ,  and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue .  this came out around the time of sense and sensibility ,  and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention .  emma is jane austen's most accessible and least stuffy story ,  told well .
1	" emma "  was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid-nineties ,  and it was recently shown on british television ,  doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with  " pride and prejudice "  two years ago .  we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic  " becoming jane "  ,  and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels .  these include  " northanger abbey "  ,  the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously ,  so the cycle should now be complete .  no doubt ,  however ,  there will be more to come in the near future .   ( there is ,  after all ,  her juvenile  " love and freindship "   ( sic )  ,  the short novella  " lady susan "  ,  and someone ,  somewhere ,  has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments  " the watsons "  and  " sanditon "  .  then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers )  .   the main character is emma woodhouse ,  a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england .   ( not ,  as some reviewers have assumed ,  victorian england- austen died before queen victoria was even born )  .  emma is ,  financially ,  considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price ,  and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband .  instead ,  her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends .  she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer ,  robert martin ,  believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton .  this scheme goes disastrously wrong ,  however ,  as elton has no interest in harriet ,  but has fallen in love with emma herself .  the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards  ( with good reason )  as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself .  this being a jane austen plot ,  emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems ,  and she too finds herself falling in love ,  leading to further complications .   emma always insists that she will not marry without affection ,  and when she does find a partner ,  the handsome mr knightley ,  we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage .  it does not ,  however ,  seem likely to be a very passionate one  ( unlike ,  say ,  that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy )  .  knightley ,  who is sixteen years older than emma  ( she is 21 ,  he 37 )  ,  and related to her by marriage ,  is more like a father-figure than a lover .  much more of a father-figure ,  in fact ,  than her actual father ,  a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather .  when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates ,  it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners .   ( his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry )  .  both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well ,  but this is not really one of the great screen romances .   of the other characters ,  i liked juliet stephenson's vulgar mrs elton and toni collette's harriet .  i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager ,  whereas here she is more like the character collette played in  " muriel's wedding " - a gauche ,  slightly overweight twentysomething ,  fretting about her chances of finding a man .  nevertheless ,  i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen's themes .    " emma "  is one of austen's more light-hearted works ,  without the darker overtones of  " mansfield park "  or even  " pride and prejudice "  ,  and this is reflected on screen .  we see a world of beauty and grace ,  full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners .  apart from the ruffianly gypsies ,  who make a very brief appearance ,  the only  " poor "  people we see are mrs bates and her daughter ,  and ,  as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500 , 000 ,  we can be sure that their poverty is relative ,  not absolute .  in emma's world ,  poverty is defined as not having your own stately home .  this is ,  of course ,  not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life ,  but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist .  sophisticated romantic comedy ,  combined with a keen eye for analysing human character ,  was more in her line .   i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994  " sense and sensibility "  or the recent  " pride and prejudice " - it tends to drag a bit in the middle ,  although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is ,  in the main ,  a highly enjoyable austen adaptation .  7/10
1	lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th century england .  northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other .  good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material  ( which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism )  .  i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up ,  and i thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do .  very good results .
1	wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds ,  emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways .   emma  ( gwyneth paltrow )  is a graceful ,  intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking .  eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her ,  she decides to match the vicar ,  mr .  elton  ( alan cummings )  with her pretty young friend ,  harriet  ( toni collette )  .   the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out ,  with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought .   the film is full of jane austen's witty and wry characterizations .  gwyneth paltrow is at her best ,  portraying this maiden of a restrained ,  polite society with wit and ease .  her growing romance with the unparalleled mr .  knightley  ( jeremy northam )  is the heart of this film .  mr .  knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films .  he is incredibly handsome ,  in a modest ,  relaxed way that is irresistible .  he is certainly well-matched to gwyneth paltrow .  their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant ,  has blossomed as he ,  a family friend ,  matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more .  with a wry look or understated jab at emma ,  northam's knightley is a delight to watch .   other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson ,  greta scacchi ,  ewan mcgregor ,  polly walker ,  and the talkative spinster ,  miss bates ,  who is very funny .   seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations ,  emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment .
1	i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature-length film  ( a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series )  it was really great .  gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr .  knightly with his poise and nobility .  i wasn't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all .  like i said ,  as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well .  i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one !
1	this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon .  the  " sisters "  in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council .  it is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges .  it will leave you ,  as it left me ,  with many questions about exactly how this change occurred .  how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon ?  have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses ?  was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court ,  against the express wishes of the husband ,  a one time event ?  i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions .  they made the movie two years ago ,  not yesterday .  and the movie they made deserves a wide audience .
1	i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels :  well ,  this transposition is simply accurate ,  intelligent ,  delicate ,  careful ,  tactful ,  respectful ,  intense ,  in a word ,  perfect !    " emma "  is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels ,  thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters .  the movie respected this subtle irony ,  not disregarding the comic element  ( miss bates above all )  .  what engaged me in the novel ,  and the movie renders it clearly ,  is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist ,  and the modern look with which women ,  men ,  and their relation are handled ,  and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century ,  who lived almost a secluded life ,  could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did :  that most and still fascinates me .  we can feel this modernity throughout the movie :  just replace costumes ,  and use a more current language but the situations ,  the feelings ,  the ideas would be extremely modern .  i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives ,  or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations ,  and still the difficulty in revealing ,  and giving expression to one's feelings ,  especially love :  every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value .    the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances :  a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role  ( nowadays she would be probably too mature for it )  ,  toni colette is simply great .  and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear !  and then ,  the breathtaking english countryside ,  where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension .  .  .  a really enjoyable and deserving movie .
1	well ,  i guess i'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema  .  .  .  helping me through my master's thesis ,  or rather keeping me from working on it !   but on watching it again several years  ( and many many movies )  later - what a well-crafted little gem this is !  i've never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance ,  and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley - where does one meet such a man ?  ?  ?  <<<sigh>>> sophie thompson's turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest  ( oh ,  napkins ,  sorry !  )  and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either - toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet ,  and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming - and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect  " impossible "  couple !   of course the sets and costumes ,  and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood ,  almost hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - although as far as cinematography and art decoration go ,  it's almost a case of visual overload .  very very pretty ,  but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period .  but the good thing is ,  the movie doesn't take itself too seriously ,  and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing - that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode .   my particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing here ,  and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully .  pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long - cut two shots  ( i can think of exactly which ones !  )  and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie .   gosh ,  i just realize  ( by reading the imdb listings )  that i've seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him - seems he's got a lot more going for him ,  as an actor ,  than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob !  hmm ,  guess i need to pay my video store a visit .  .  .   lovely movie .  my favorite jane austen adaptation so far - though perhaps ang lee's sense and sensibility is ,  strictly speaking ,  the better movie ,  this one is closest to my heart - and i've certainly seen it many more times !  watch it if you can - and don't be too hard on its little imperfections .
1	this is a good adaptation of austen's novel .  good ,  but not brilliant .   the cinematography is inventive ,  crossing at times the border to gimmickry ,  but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes ,  given that the entire story is dialogue-driven .   the acting is competent .  ms paltrow is aloof ,  as her character requires ,  but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions .  in other words ,  she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours .  some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures .  personally ,  i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton - to no fault of his own ,  except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in  " the high life "  that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part .  acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth ,  and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level .
1	emma is a true romance .  if you love the soppy stuff ,  charged with wit and folly ,  you will love this movie !  its true to the novel ,  which is very important ,  with a few twists added for pleasure .  gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades .  she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to .    jeremy northam ,  as the hero .  how shocked are you ?  i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck !  what the right role can do for you !  he looks so good as the sensible ,  regal mr .  k ,  that i am literally looking at him in a new light .  he makes and excellent romantic lead .  the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful !   ewan mcgregor ,  greta sacchi brings in the rest .  a good cast .  a good movie .  if you are a fan of jane austen ,  see this movie ,  along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly ,  buy the books .  it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
1	jane austen would definitely approve of this one !   gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma .  she is funny without being excessively silly ,  yet elegant .  she puts on a very convincing british accent  ( not being british myself ,  maybe i'm not the best judge ,  but she fooled me .  .  . she was also excellent in  " sliding doors "  .  .  . i sometimes forget she's american ~ !  )  .    also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law  ( emma thompson's sister and mother )  as the bates women .  they nearly steal the show .  .  . and ms .  law doesn't even have any lines !   highly recommended .
1	i have no idea how a texan  ( the director ,  douglas mcgrath )  and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms .  paltrow was in the first place !  i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar-winning  " shakespeare in love "  performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse .  she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this .   of course ,  she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette ,  greta scacchi ,  juliette stevenson et al .  .  . jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest ,  even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow  ( in the process ,  allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship )  ;  several years on ,  ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and ,  personally ,  i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays .  but the standout is ,  without a doubt ,  sophie thompson  ( sister of emma thompson ,  daughter of phyllida law )  as miss bates ;  what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates ,  as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn .  the film is worth watching  ( again even )  for her performance alone .   all in all ,  this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system .  well worth a rental  ( because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again--but we'll always have emma )  .
1	romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england ,  in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue ,  the ladies were charming and elegant ,  and the gentlemen dashing .  `emma , ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath ,  stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role .  a self-appointed matchmaker ,  emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another .  coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage ,  she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend ,  harriet  ( toni collette )  ,  but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying .  meanwhile ,  her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr .  knightley  ( jeremy northam )  ,  whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's ,  and lend some needed balance to the proceedings .  and emma ,  so concerned with what is right for others ,  neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all :  her own .  the world goes round and love abounds ,  but emma is about to miss the boat .  luckily for her ,  however ,  the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings .  now ,  if she can but stop long enough to realize it .  but as everyone who has known true love knows ,  matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant ,  depending upon the slightest thing ;  and while romance is at hand for emma ,  she must first recognize it ,  and seize the moment .   	mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful ,  feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world .  there may be an air of frivolity about it ,  but in retrospect ,  this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone :  love .  and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing ,  it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable .  it's a pleasant ,  affecting film ,  with a wonderful cast ,  that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place .  it's light fare ,  but absorbing ;  and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow .   	the winsome paltrow ,  who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love' two years after making this one ,  seems comfortable and right at home in this genre .  she personifies all things british ,  and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether .  she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy .  she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner ,  very reminiscent of audrey hepburn .  yet paltrow is unique .  as an actor ,  she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `hard eight , ' `hush' and `a perfect murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively ,  and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own .  but it's with characters like emma that she really shines .  she is so expressive and open ,  and her personality is so engaging ,  that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch ,  regardless of the part she is playing .  and for emma ,  she is absolutely perfect .   	jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley ,  and like paltrow ,  seems suited to the genre-- in the right role ,  that is ;  his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl , ' in which he played an italian prince ,  was less than satisfying .  here ,  however ,  he is perfect ;  he is handsome ,  and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real .  like colin firth's mr .  darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice , ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr .  knightley .   	also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette ,  as emma's friend harriet smith ;  and alan cumming ,  as the reverend elton .  respectively ,  collette and cumming create characters who are very real people ,  and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film .  and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema ,  and to films of any genre .   	the supporting cast includes greta scacchi  ( mrs .  weston )  ,  denys hawthorne  ( mr .  woodhouse )  ,  sophie thompson  ( miss bates )  ,  kathleen byron  ( mrs .  goddard )  ,  phyllida law  ( mrs .  bates )  ,  polly walker  ( jane fairfax )  and ewan mcgregor  ( frank churchill )  .  an uplifting ,  elegant film ,  `emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness .  and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen ,  it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this ,  if only for a couple of hours ,  as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit .  and that's the magic of the movies .  i rate this one 9/10 .
1	this is one of the best films i have seen in years !  i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan ,  but she is excellent as emma woodhouse .  alan cumming is superb as reverand elton ,  and emma thompson's sister ,  sophie ,  is hysterical as miss bates .  and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr .  knightley ;  what a gentleman !  whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma .  i think that is what separates it from so many others--it's classy .   if you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family ,  or looking for a romance for yourself ,  look no further .  emma is that movie .  with a beautiful setting ,  wonderful costumes ,  and an outstanding cast  ( have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam ?  )  ,  emma is a perfect ten !
1	i was so impressed with doug mcgrath's film version of the jane austen novel  " emma ,  "  and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much ,  that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re-united for  " nicholas nickleby "  i immediately rented it without any other consideration .   i have read the book ,  and for those overly-critical fans of this jane austen adaptation ,  i don't know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen's work ,  especially given the limitations of a two hour movie  ( which some have complained about being too long !  )  .  and as far as gwen paltrow's accent is concerned ,  i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially ,  and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress !   i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery .  that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside .  the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success .  if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker ,  then perhaps you should rent something like  " death wish iii !  "   the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast ,  and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings .  mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story .   this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex ,  violence or even a villainous antagonist .  the story is often amusing ,  endearing ,  and at times ,  quite touching .   i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite .
1	a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association  ( wla )  of kumba ,  in southwest cameroon ,  in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence .  in this muslim culture ,  where men have always been sovereign over women ,  according to sharia law ,  one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children .  after 17 years of failed efforts ,  leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins ,  and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories .   the leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa ,  a state prosecutor ,  and beatrice ntuba ,  a senior judge  ( court president )  .  both play themselves in this film ,  which may contain footage shot spontaneously ,  though i imagine much of it ,  if not all ,  consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera .  four cases are reviewed ,  and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film .   two cases involve repeated wife beating ,  with forcible sex in one case ;  another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl ;  and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child ,  age 8 ,  by an aunt .  one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce .  we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials .  the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children .  the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines ;  the divorce is granted .   the aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law .  also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties ,  including those found guilty ,  are treated .  this is a highly important and well made film .   ( of interest is the fact that one of the directors ,  ms .  longinotto ,  also co-directed the 1998 film ,  divorce ,  iranian style ,  which dealt with related themes in tehran .  )   ( in broken english with english subtitles )  .  my grade :  b+ 8/10
1	by no means my favourite austen novel ,  and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress ,  but i found the film almost totally delightful .  paltrow does a good job ,  and cummings ,  stevenson and the one who plays 'miss bates' are all absolutely terrific .  the period detail is not alienating ;  the feel of the movie is just right ,  in fact .  but the real 'find' is jeremy northam as mr knightley .  there could not be more perfect casting ,  imo .  i hated mr k in the novel ,  but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film .  northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment ,  either !  highly recommended .  anar
1	what a delightful film .  .  .   accompanied by oscar-winning composer rachel portman's lush ,  emotional and dreamy music ,  this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year .   incredible casting .  .  .   gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma .  toni collette was great as harriett smith .   the character who stole the film was miss bates !  !  !  she was mesmerizing to watch ,  one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her .  one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages .  from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr .  woodhouse for sending  " that lovely quarter-hind of pork .  .  .  pork ,  mother !  !  !  "  she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother ,  mrs .  bates  ( played by emma thompson's mother ,  phyllida law )  who looks forlorn and lost .   the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart .  we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf .  it is a classic scene ,  one to be rewound and played over & over .  .  .   the ending is right up there with  " sense & sensibility "  and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend .  .  .   i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself .   i adored it !
1	i love this movie .  my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film .  we had no idea what it was going to be about ,  but it turned out spectacular .  2 thumbs up .  i liked how the film was shot ,  and the actors were very funny .  if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie .  i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won't .  this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies .  do you really think nothing is bouncy ?
1	make the world go away .  get it off my shoulder .  say the things you used to say ,  and make the world go away .   well ,  dave  ( david hewlett )  and andrew  ( andrew miller )  were in a pickle ,  one for embezzlement ,  and the other for kissing a child .  neither was guilty ,  but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down ,  they ended up in ,  well ,  nothing .  the whole world ,  except for their house went away .   it is kind of weird ,  but funny ,  too .  just what would you do if you were all alone in the world ?  the two friends just enjoy each other's company ,  and do what they want .  but ,  that gets old fast ,  it seems .   then they start to improve their live by hating away memories .  the sound effects during this were great .   things really got weird at the end .  this film was the product of a great imagination ,  and written and directed by vincenzo natali ,  with help from the two stars .  it just has to be seen .
1	i totally agree that  " nothing "  is a fantastic film !  i've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages !  and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this !  they really work well together !  this film may not appeal to some people  ( i can't really say why without spoiling it !  )  but each to their own !  i loved it and highly recommend it !   the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever .  it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it !   although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch .
1	whether it's a good movie or not ,  films of this kind has to be made ,  i think .  it remembers me of  " i love huckabees "  ,  a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with isabelle huppert being sodomized by a young american in a mud pond ,  in a merry sadistic-masochist way  (  ?  ?  !  !  !  !  )  .  i hope the director will go on stepping across the border ,  as though i felt the choices vincenzo natali made ,  were not always subtle  ( some of the scenes were unhappily kind of  " tarte-à-la-crème "  ,  like a childish slapstick )  ,  speaking about script and cinematography the color of  " cube "  was black ,   " nothing "  is white ,  more cheerful ,  surprisingly ,  than the former films of natali .
1	the only word that sums up this movie is quirky .  it's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept .  bouncy  ( in more way than one )  and a bit nutty .  i wouldn't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesn't seem quite as memorable as the director's first movie  " cube "  but it's a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning .  the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that's how it was to be written .  done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension .  a little like  " the matrix "  meets  " head "  meets  " human nature "  .   6 . 8 out of ten
1	yes .  .  . i'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why .  in the last few years ,  i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget .  then i stumble upon  " nothing "  .  looked interesting ,  wasn't expecting much though .  i was wrong .  this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch .  dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember ,  but not over complex to the point of missing the joke .  i don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes ,  because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once .  with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies  ( you know ,  like killer military jets and  " fresh "  remakes that are ruining old classics )  ,  this movie will make you happy to say it's ok to laugh at  " nothing "  .
1	this movie was very funny ,  i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days !  the movie is distinctively unique in it's humor and visuals ,  both are terrific and on par with natali's other  ( more serious )  movie gems cube and cypher .  i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he's made is very interesting .   very likable about this movie are the music and  " loser "  characters dave and andrew ,  portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller  ( co-writer of the story )  ,  actors i both like very much .  also cool are the x-box dead or alive fights  ( you even see dave playing halo at a point )  and andrew's amazing guitar solo ,  among many other things .   all in all a great feel-good film about friendship .  you have to see this !
1	i work at a movie store ,  and as such ,  i am always on the look-out for an excellent movie .  i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section ,  and i've been trying to support my country's movie industry .  i was in for a surprise .  the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships .  .  . without working that hard .  it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters ,  as well as some funny exchanges  (  " we can't be dead ,  we have cable !  "  )  .  what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot ,  even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .
1	sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce ,  iranian style' which was as exactly as it stated ,  as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran .  now they've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon ,  africa .  what's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women ,  which is unusual for such a country like this .  anyways ,  they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women ,  but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society ,  with divorce legal and women's rights being recognized .  so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times .  not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment .  one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt .  the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury .  and who said that justice isn't served anymore ?  with these 2 behind the bench .  they often carry out maximum penalties !  ya !  you go girl !
1	this is a good movie ,  but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies .  it's about two guys that wish that the world would go away , and that's exactly what they get .  the acting is great ,  the ending was not predictable , and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days .  people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring .  i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger  ( i actually like b movies )  or the grim adventures of billy and mandy .  one note :  if you notice this ,  this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors .  make it two notes :  wait after the credits  ( trust me on this one )  .  enjoy the movie .
1	i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience .  the imagination on display ,  the visual interpretation of the script ,  the humor is constantly surprising .  the two leads are great and really carry the film .  my advice would be to not even watch a trailer ,  just rent the film and watch without expectations .  i rented from blockbuster ,  so it is readily available in brisbane ,  not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that's always good ,  unless it's just 'that was stupid' .  i loved this film ,  you just don't get to see gem's like this every day .  this should become a cult favorite .  give it a try ,  you may just feel the same way about it as i do .
1	i thought this was an awesome movie .  the theme song is sweet !   :  )  anyway ,  the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning ,  when everything should have been normal .  it was very weird and unrealistic .  the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about .  apart from that ,  the movie was very creative .  i think that all the acting was well done ,  the actors acted out their characters' personalities perfectly .  everything fit together well .  it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack .  that would have been great !  because this is a canadian film ,  and because it is one of my favorites ,  i give this movie a 10 out of 10 !
1	tweaked a little bit ,  'nothing' could be a children's film .  it's a very clever concept ,  touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes ,  and goes against pretty much every hollywood convention you can think of .  .  . what goes against everything more than ,  literally ,   " nothing "  ?  nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives .  all that's left is what they don't hate ,  and a big empty white space .  it's hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film ,  especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot .  it focuses on pretty much one subject ,  but that's prime vincenzo natali territory .  if you've seen 'cube' ,  you know already that he tends to like that type of situation .  the  " nothing "  in this movie is apparently infinite space ,  but natali somehow manages to make it somewhat claustrophobic ,  if only because there's literally nothing else ,  and nowhere else to go .  the actors sell it ,  although you can tell these guys are friends anyway .  two actors from 'cube' return here  ( worth and kazan )  ,  but are entirely different characters .  they change throughout the story ,  and while they're not the strongest actors in the world ,  they're at least believable .   the reason i say this could be a children's film under the right tweaks ,  is because aside from a few f-bombs and a somewhat unnecessary bloody dream sequence ,  the whimsical and often silly feel of this movie could very much be digested easily by kids .  so i find it an odd choice that the writers decided to add some crass language and a small amount of gore ,  especially considering there isn't very much of it .  this could've gotten a pg rating easily had they simply cut a few things out and changed a little dialogue .  there is very little objectionable about this film ,  but just enough to keep parents from wanting their kids to see it .  i only say that's a shame because not because i support censorship ,  but because that may have been the only thing preventing this movie from having wider exposure .   at any rate ,  this is a reasonably entertaining film ,  albeit with a few dragged-out scenes .  but for literally being about nothing ,  and focused entirely on two characters and their interactions with absolutely nothing ,  they do a surprisingly good job for an independent film .
1	a light-hearted comedy ,  nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to :  a world of nothing .  anything you don't like ,  be it a stack of bills ,  a bad memory ,  or even hunger can disappear at your wish .  they approached this movie very well ,  and with an enjoyable starring duo ,  there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing ,  and they weren't even part of the main movie .   first ,  the post-credits scene  ( and yes ,  there is one )  :  good for a chuckle ,  but what were they trying to accomplish with that ?  i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing .  instead ,  we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream .  it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion ,  and wasn't really necessary ,  nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame .   second ,  the trailer :  i saw the trailer on the dvd ,  and like others have already said this ,  it promotes a horror movie that never came .  oh well ,  poor marketing i guess .   if you see this at your movie rental store ,  take a look ,  because nothing is a great movie to watch .  if you have a big screen though ,  you might want to wear shades .
1	well ,   " cube "   ( 1997 )  ,  vincenzo's first movie ,  was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that i've ever seen when talking about movies .  they had just one scenery ,  a bunch of actors and a plot .  so ,  what made it so special were all the effective direction ,  great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth .  his second movie ,   " cypher "   ( 2002 )  ,  was all about its story ,  but it wasn't so good as  " cube "  but here are the characters being tested like rats again .    " nothing "  is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his 'cube days' ,  locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room .  but instead of a thriller sci-fi  ( even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that )  ,   " nothing "  is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we're living .  once again vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing .  2 actors and a blinding white scenario ,  that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that .  while  " cube "  is a claustrophobic experience and  " cypher "  confusing ,   " nothing "  is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate .   this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget .  of course that the movie fails sometimes ,  but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws .  there's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since  " cube "  .
1	having seen cube ,  i've been a fan of vincenzo natali's work .  natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline ,  and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster .  instead ,  he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways ,  so much in fact ,  that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape ,  or in the case of nothing ,  a large empty expanse where there is .  .  .  nothing !  the advert had me hooked instantly .  it seemed so simple !  take two characters who no one likes ,  and send them to a world where there is nothing .  natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist .  in fact ,  the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film .  there's nothing there ,  but also 'something' there .   it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading .  i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so .  therefore upon watching the film ,  i laughed every now and again ,  whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused .   if i may take a minute to give the film some praise ,  where the film excels on is the concept .  it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing ,  and to put two characters there ,  not two brilliant minded characters ,  who will philosophise and work out their surroundings ,  but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are !  another strong point is the film's cinematography ,  though at first this may not seem it !  where each wall ,  north ,  earth ,  south ,  west ,  up and down is just a white plane ,  a perception of depth becomes faulty .  it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis-en-scene .  the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens ,  but for the most part ,  the camera is placed so that two characters ,  or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background ,  allowing a sense of depth to be realised .   however ,  this film does lack in certain areas .  the film is relatively short ,  but even so ,  after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull ,  and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot .  we can also argue that the acting is once again ,  questionable .  these two characters are in a sense ,  unlikeable ,  therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters .  however ,  on a flip side of that ,  the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough ,  but there is something lacking .   even so ,  i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film !  do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film .  it is much more of a comedy than that !  it is indeed worth watching though ,  purely for the concept itself !
1	i chanced upon this movie because i had a free non-new release from blockbuster and needed to grab something quickly ,  as the store was getting ready to close for the evening .  the plain white cover and title intrigued me .  i'm a  ( relatively speaking )   " old "  lady and my son is a young man of 30 .  i adore movies that are sheer entertainment ,  such as the sixth sense ,  interview with a vampire ,  harry potter and beetlejuice .  my son ,  on the other hand ,  is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films ,  such as those directed by bergman or hertzog .  we generally hate each other's movie choices ,  however ,  we both watched and loved the movie nothing !  it was unlike any movie we'd ever seen before .  we're both cynical/critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them -- but in this case we just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to finish .  it is our opinion that if this movie had been promoted and shown in the main stream theaters in the u . s .  it would have done very well indeed .
1	i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film ,  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed .  it made much of the fact that the film was  " by the director of cube "  and made it look like a horror film ,  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  ( imdb's spell checker doesn't seem to think that absurdist is a word ,  but it is )  ,  reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead .   i love the way the story builds up slowly at first ,  then gradually escalates .  i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film .  that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube .  i recommend it .
1	director vincenzo natali first showed his penchant for character-based sci-fi flicks with his 1997 short film  " elevated "  ,  wherein 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters roam the building .  his follow-up feature project  " cube "  ,  released later that year ,  had a very similar premise ,  this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast expansion of interlocking cubic deathtraps .  both were admirable attempts to take the sci-fi genre a step further ,  by deliberately declining to show almost any visual stimulation ,  choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element ,  how the characters act ,  react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions .  after his exploration into the mainstream with 2002's  " cypher "  ,  natali has come back to his bizarre character-film trend to bring us  " nothing "  ,  his latest ,  and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of  " what if ?  "   dave  ( david hewlett )  and andrew  ( andrew miller )  are life-long friends ,  brought together by a mutual detachment from society and a lack of any one else to be with .  dave ,  who has always been hindered by a selfish and somewhat dimwitted nature ,  lives rent-free with andrew at his ill-located and ill-constructed house ,  where he often takes advantage of andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality .  despite all this ,  the two misfits are happy together ,  until one day their deep character flaws ,  coupled with some astronomically bad luck ,  land them in the middle of some pretty serious ,  jail-sentence-worthy trouble .  on top of this ,  they discover that their house has been deemed unfit for existence and is scheduled to be demolished before sunset ,  so in the hazy ,  nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them ,  they wish that the whole world would just disappear .  and it does .   going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow  ( occasionally too slow )  reveal about what's happened to dave and andrew ,  and how they deal with their new reality .  natali's fascination with studying human behavior under duress  ( ala the birds )  is here in spades ,  but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers ,  he's able to break away from the thriller-horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level .  it's almost as if he's made the aphoristic opposite of  " cube "  .   of course ,  the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine .  in keeping with fundamental realism ,  our two anti-heroes' dynamic often becomes antagonistic ,  sometimes with rather nasty results .  like the  " desert island "  game ,  the film looks at how even best friends ,  when left alone together ,  can fall apart ,  but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence .  in a very twisted ,  sci-fi way ,  this is a feel-good flick ,  with good heart and good intentions .   however ,  there are a few qualms to be had with  " nothing "  .  while the two lead actors ,  hewlett and miller ,  do well with their parts ,  their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been ,  considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour .  there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew ,  some background is given ,  but ultimately not enough .  a generous viewer will sit through the less-engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end ,  but cynics will probably give up pretty fast .   acting ,  as mentioned ,  is adequate ,  and considering the amount of 'green-screen' work that would've been needed ,  reasonably convincing .  david hewlett and andrew miller ,  who both wrote co-wrote the screenplay ,  have been long-time friends of vincenzo natali :  hewlett has in fact featured in every film natali has made .  perhaps it was their creative input that steered this film in a more positive direction .  nonetheless ,  the story could have been a lot more involving .  granted ,  it is relatively entertaining considering that  ( no pun intended )  nothing really happens ,  but you get the impression that ,  in more experienced hands ,  a lot more could've been done with this premise .   in all fairness ,   " nothing "  is an impressive piece of work in many ways .  the concept is interesting ,  the direction is inventive ,  the script works on a human level and ,  most of all ,  it shows a progression in natali's creative mentality .  for fans of his work ,  this will be a delight ,  and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little unwanted time .  it's just a shame that the director's fixation on human drama prevented it from being the great ,  fun film it could have been .
1	if you want mindless action ,  hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of seattle ,  then this is the show for you !   the concept of dark angel isn't anything new  ( in fact ,  there's controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book )  ,  but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to finish .   jessica alba is smoking and max' friends  ( original cindy ,  kendra )  are just as hot .    the fight scenes are getting better ,  but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better  ( the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it )  .   in my opinion ,  dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for ,  but if you're looking for hard hitting ,  award-winning drama ,  go watch  " the west wing "  or something .
1	i just saw this at the toronto film festival ,  and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again !  it is a character-driven film ,  and andrew and david are more than up to the task .  any discussion of the plot might be  considered spoilers ,  so i'll just say that the storyline is clever ,  the acting is superb ,  and the effects are amazing .  well-filmed and well-paced too .  one of the best films i have seen in ages ,  and very refreshing in this summer of dreary  movies .  it had the audience laughing the whole time .  see it if you can .   ( i particularly liked the  " candy bar !  candy bar !  "  scene .  )
1	i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk .  well actually ,  it doesn't ,  because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't - original ,  creative ,  quirky and humorous .  it seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as ,  in the simplest terms ,  it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film .   i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention ,  even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes !  essentially ,  it is about nothing ,  as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world .  the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white ,  empty space .  this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors ,  both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles .   i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit .  however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try .  a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion ,  with the combination of good performances ,  a strong script ,  nice sound design and  ( fairly )  impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie .   it's just a shame so few people know about nothing .  .  .  .
1	all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you .  plus jessica is just all kinds of hot !  !  !  !  !  the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell .  that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen .
1	sitting ,  typing nothing is the latest  " what if ?  "  fest offered by vincenzio natali ,  and starring david hewlitt and andrew miller as two losers .  one is having relationship problems ,  got canned from his job  ( because of relationship problems )  and the police are out to get him  ( because of his job and his relationship problems )  .  the other guy is a agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home ,  is met by a bothersome girl guide who calls on her mom to claim she was molested when he doesn't buy cookies from him .  oh yeah ,  the police are after him too ,  after the mom of the girl scout call them in to arrest him .   man ,  what a day .   what if you could make all of this disappear ?  that is the whole premise behind 'nothing' .  the two fools realize ,  the cops ,  the girl scout ,  the cars ,  the lawn ,  the road ,  everything disappear .  there's nothing but white space !  this is an interesting concept i thought .  i also looked at the time of this ,  30 minutes had gone in the movie ,  and i still had an hour left in the movie .  could the 2 actors make this work and keep us entertained for 60 minutes ?  although the actors try ,  60 minutes is a long time and there is clearly dead air in places of this movie .  but the two actors ,  whom are life-long friends with each other and the director ,  have such great repertoire with each other ,  that it was fun to watch for the dialogue and improve goofing around the two do .  there are lots of supernatural elements ,  but it's more of their response to these elements that ultimately make this film worth seeing .
1	nothing is fantastic !  simple as that !  it's a film that shouldn't work ,  yet does .  natali stays in the realm of sci-fi ,  however this film is also a comedy .  cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali  ( at $7 . 5million !  woo-hoo pa !  )  so with nothing he scales down again .  this is low budget ,  independent film-making at it's best .  simple ,  good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain .  nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask ,  no it is not anything like seinfeld !  basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers .  they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways .  andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out .  dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with .  by bizarre mis-fortunes however ,  dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work-place incriminating dave ,  and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout  ( canadian humour people !  )  .  as it turns out andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on .  both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling .  they are desperate and can't escape ,  and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white .  what has happened ?  have dave and andrew died ?  they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet .  no police ,  no demolition team ,  no angry girl scout mother !  what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to  " wish or hate away .  "  as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world .  they are left alone .  the house is surrounded by nothing ,  which is portrayed as pure white .  so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white .  the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water ,  they begin to tire of each other .  they discover they can hate away hunger ,  which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say .  i can't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold .   this film is quirky ,  funny ,  interesting .  the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube ,  david hewlett ,  and andrew millar to lead the film .  they have chemistry and also work very well .  they have to hold 90% of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background ,  yet it works .  certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states .  nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers .   natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature .  i prey to god he doesn't do the proposed necropolis ,  written and directed by add sufferer ,  the ever crap paul anderson .  vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad ,  run !  !  !  run like the wind !  !  i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex proyas did  ( with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed ,  sugar coated ,  helium light :  i robot !  )  .  keep your eyes peeled for this guy .  ****
1	.  .  .  than this  ; - )  what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie ?  this movie starts with a touch of brazil .  .  .  when ,  at a certain point ,  the story moves straight into the twilight zone .  .  .  bringing up nothing new ,  but just nothing .  .  .  and nothing is great fun !  when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable .  .  .  bouncing heads ?  well .  .  .  yes  ; - )    anyway .  .  .  this movie was ,  imho ,  the biggest surprise at this year's fantasyfilmfest .  .  .   just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic ,  weird but very special design ,  which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time .  .  .  timeless somehow .  .  .
1	nothing  ( 3+ outta 5 stars )  another weird premise from the director of the movie  " cube "  .  this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void .  there is literally nothing outside of their small two-story house .  intriguing to be sure ,  but i thought the comedic tone established for this movie from the get-go was extremely ill-conceived .  there needs to be some humour ,  certainly .  .  .  and i have no problem with the humour that was eventually derived from the plight of our two heroes  ( their final  " showdown "  was definitely a hoot )  .  .  .  but i really think the movie would have been a lot better off if it had stayed more rooted in reality in the beginning .  after watching the movie i watched the  " making of "  feature on the dvd and a short trailer at the end is almost totally devoid of the  " sillier "  comedic aspects .  .  .  making it look like a completely different  ( and slightly better )  movie .  the last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together .  .  .  similar in a way to the recent movie  " primer .  "  the actors are fine when they are not overdoing the comedy shtick .  they are really quite believable in their more  " normal "  moments .  i was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the midway point .  .  .  but it won me over by the end .   ( and keep watching past the credits for the final scene .  .  .  just don't ask me to explain it .  )
1	the premise of this movie has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now .  we've all heard or read about it in some kind of con-text .  what would you do if you were all alone in the world ?  what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes ?  in fact ,  the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew ,  two room-mates living in a run-down house in the middle of a freeway system .  andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society .  that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along ,  because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed .  just until .  .  .   straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them .  both of them get involved with crime ,  andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn't dare going out of the house .  dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues don't treat him very well and with the respect he deserves .  the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it .  this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away .  .  .  and of course that is exactly what happens .   the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness .  at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment ,  but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left .   nothing features an incredibly small cast - in fact ,  besides the first couple of shots from the film ,  we only see dave  ( david hewlett )  and andrew  ( andrew miller )  in the entire film .  it is clear that in order to pull this off ,  the cast has to be more than up for the task ,  because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way .  vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well .  director of photography ,  derek rogers ,  also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information ,  especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it ,  but we don't see it right away .   obviously ,  this can't be an event driven film and it's not .  much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void .  and that's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place ,  especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar .   now ,  one could be thinking :   " how does nothing look like ?  "  well ,  it looks like nothing indeed .  the entire world of nothing is white .  .  .  white no matter in what direction you look .  this is the weakness of this film .  .  .  after an hour or less it's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it's more interesting to look at .  thank god ,  there are some .  for example at times when the two lads ,  due to the properties of nothing ,  are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of .  .  .  tofu  ( as andrew claims )  .  it's fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society .   one of the best parts of the film is the set .  .  .  production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film ,  the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at ,  still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this .  all in all ,  the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching .  .  .   however ,  the very best part of the film is the acting .  both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are .  the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said ,  there are just about no props in the film ,  they are really on a bare stage .  with plenty of character development and some decent one-liners ,  clever dialogue  ( at times hilariously stupid )  ,  it all works to that end - and this really moves the movie away from the low-budget area to well-crafted handwork .   let's talk a little about the visual effects ,  because they are definitely worth mentioning .  nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film .  there's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film ,  and although the drews have milked that scene completely it's still fun to watch .  one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the abilities to wish everything away ,  so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear ?    " nothing "  is a bright and well-lit movie ,  it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead  ( this is in fact one of their theories )  ,  but  " nothing "  is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory .  we don't know where they are or what has happened to them .  we don't know if they will ever get out ,  because the movie ends before we see anything like that .  the ending ,  by the way ,  is not as good as it could've been .  it's rather easy to predict what is going to happen ,  still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end ,  it's a reasonably satisfactory one .   take  " hollow man "  ,   " kill bill "  ,   " cube "  ,   " epoch "  and lots of other films and you have  " nothing "  .  it really is an amalgam of different styles ,  still there is no other film  ( at least that i know of )  nothing is really like .  for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube .  he talks about him and andré bijelic having been room-mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out ,   " nothing "  could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story ,  and to that end ,  it's almost like one of the cube prequels .   what can i say ?  i enjoyed  " nothing "  ,  it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well-made with tons of intelligent ideas ,  still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is .  .  .  maybe if we have a  " nothing 2 "  i can answer that question .   " nothing "  is a great film ,  but not as good as i expected it to be .   final rating :  7 . 5 / 10
1	i wasn't sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this .  a smart ,  slightly twisted comedy that makes you think .  i wasn't quite sure how a director can create  " nothing "  ,  but leave it to mr .  natali and the brilliant individuals at c . o . r . e .  to create another low budget set that looks real  ( as real as nothing can be )  .  well worth your time and money ,  if you have the opportunity to see this ,  please go .  you'll be glad you did .
1	just saw this at the 2003 vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal .  takes place in toronto ,  where these two losers live in this run-down house in the middle of a freeway system .  david hewlett  ( pin ,  cube ,  cypher )  and andrew miller  ( cube )  are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away .  the acting ,  dialogue and writing are very good ,  and the whole film looks great for such a low-budget flick .  director/writer vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening ,  and he seemed so intelligent and down-to-earth .  this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets ,  it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame !
1	charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular ,  but this canadian gem makes it hilarious .    like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let's set the scene ,  two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood ,  they can't cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to .  but that is where even more problems begin .   i loved this film ,  it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of  " nothing "  out there .   don't miss this .
1	i haven't written a review on imdb for the longest time ,  however ,  i felt myself compelled to write this !  when looking up this movie i found one particular review which urged people not to see this film .  do not pay any attention to this ignorant person !  nothing is a fantastic film ,  full of laughs and above all .  .  .  imagination !  aren't you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble-gum trash movies ?  sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before .  i don't even care if you dislike  ( even hate )  the movie ,  but no one has a right to discredit the film .  imdb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film like that .  just say you hate it and why you hate it .  .  .  but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't watch it .  we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you .   if my judgment is any good ,  i'd say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it .   treat your mind to a bit of eye-candy !  see nothing !
1	jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage-producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming  " talking "  movies .   this story of love ,  deceit ,  women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment .  the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done .  the story never really got lost in this frantic pace .   some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time-frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time .   jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film ,  never loosing his composure as the ever-working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros .  in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business ,  he was a broadway producer before he started this .  joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest ,  nan ,  she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time ,  so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change .   the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end .  these were magnificent in itself ,  beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced ,  but they just didn't seem to fit in the story .  the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did .  i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater .  in this way the  " sitting on a backyard fence "  was much more appropriate to the story .   the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing .  i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up .  these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well .   all in all a great film with a sour ending .   9/10
1	how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me .  i loved this show before i even saw it .  for 3 reasons ,  1 .  the story intrigued me ,  2 .  jessica alba and 3 .  james cameron !  please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made !   i hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you  " dark angel "  fans hate them too .  they have a thing for canning good shows !  don't you all agree ?
1	089 :  footlight parade  ( 1933 )  - released 9/30/1933 ,  viewed 5/5/07 .   the ice cream cone is invented in new york .   kevin :  after a long and busy break ,  we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros .  this time it's the ultra-fast paced footlight parade ,  starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent .  i am 100% certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent ,  who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute .  joan blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest .  the ruby keeler/dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable .  one thing that baffled me was berkeley's performances themselves ,  which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage ,  let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards .  obviously busby doesn't let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure .  i liked nearly all of this movie until the end ,  with the shamelessly offensive number  " shanghai lil ,  "  which ,  as one can guess ,  is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come .   doug :  six movies in three months .  got to be a new record .  anywaythis completes warner bros . ' musical trilogy of 1933 ,  preceded by '42nd street' and 'gold diggers of 1933 . ' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row .  i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie ,  or if that the role as written was inspired by busby .  i hope it was ;  it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does .  the funny thing about cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense .  he was 5'7 "  ,  square-headed ,  and talked with an odd new york accent .  but the guy was quite versatile ,  going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast-talking producer-types we see here .  and he could dance .  basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor .  the rest of the cast has some familiar faces ;  joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney's loyal and lusting secretary ;  dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple ,  but seem to get less screen time than before ;  billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp .  the movie is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-code era ,  as opposed to those of the 50's and 60's that were more family oriented ,  and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year  ( the  " shanghai lil "  number not withstanding ,  with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese )  .   last film :  dinner at eight  ( 1933 )  .  next film :  i'm no angel  ( 1933 )  .
1	such energy and vitality .  you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best .  of course the choreography is wonderful ,  but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight .  don't miss this one .
1	wow .  .  .  what .  .  .  a whirlwind .  the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine ,  especially during the early talkies phase .  there were movies which are painfully static and dull ,  like  " dracula "  with bella lugosi ,  and there were those that just don't give it a rest ,  sometimes in a good way and other times not .  this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute ,  and that is both a wonder and a pity .  lloyd bacon ,  who also directed  " 42nd street "  ,  must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema ,  for he filled this picture with it .  there mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking .  it's completely crazy !  i was thinking the movie deserved a 5  ( or a 6 ,  tops )  because the pacing was very poor ,  since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think .  the characters seemed to just running to and fro places ,  talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else .  i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache .  i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in  " 42nd street "  ,  ruby keeler ,  and  " 42nd street "  was a movie whose ending was the best part of it .  and you know what ?  it happened the same thing with  " footlight parade "  !  the ending is absolutely incredible !  it has become ,  hands down ,  the most impressive musical i have ever seen .  the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are ,  believe me ,  something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth .  the numbers are flawless !  there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one .  suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work ,  beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache .
1	the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over-rated 42nd street .  this is the definitive 30's musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney .  one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced .  a must see .
1	in 1933 dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes .  gold diggers of 1933 ,  42nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on .  in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley ,  show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players .   all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney .  warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash .  both lack the infectious energy of cagney however ,  who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical .  he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers ,  unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend .   of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is .  the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh ,  hugh herbert ,  guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size .  busby berkeley's dance numbers are surreal ,  suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in 34 .  sadly ,  the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again .  gentility and morality made sure of it .
1	never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely :  dick powell ,   ( scott blair )  who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler ,   ( bea thorn )  .  james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's .  chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows .  this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs .  joan blondell ,   ( nan prescott )  gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty .  dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career .  enjoy .
1	a wonder .  one of the best musicals ever .  the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular ,  but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell .   ( keeler is also lovely ,  even though she may not have been a great actress )  .  there's a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today ,  much less in the usually stilted 30s films ,  even though the plot ,  involving the setting up of movies prologues ,  is quite dated .
1	i loved this film ,  seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen !  the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things ,  and the fast pace was most enjoyable .   i do ,  as a singer and musical director ,  question one section of roby keeler's vocal in  " by a waterfall .  "  the key modulated ,  and she was suddenly singing much lower ,  in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals .   does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer ?  it sounds it to me .  i would love to know .   thanks so much .
1	clever ,  gritty ,  witty ,  fast-paced ,  sexy ,  extravagant ,  sleazy ,  erotic ,  heartfelt and corny ,  footlight parade is a first-class entertainment ,  what the movies are all about .   the realistic ,  satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking .  to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this !  the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today ,  especially considering that  " realism "  has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema .   this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh ,  self-referential ,  critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age .  i'd recommend watching any film from this period ,  that is 1930-1935 ,  for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be .
1	it's hard to say which comes out on top ,  james cagney's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of busby berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close .  i give it a tie ,  with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals .  although the movie clearly belongs to cagney ,  joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line .    and what's the story line ?  it's about chester kent  ( cagney )  who produces musicals ,  and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over .  he starts doing prologues ,  live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts .  he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them ,  moving them around the country .  he's a ball of fire and ideas ,  and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things .  but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas ;  nan prescott  ( blondell )  ,  his wise-cracking secretary ,  loves him but he's too busy too notice ;  an office girl in black-rimmed ,  round glasses  ( ruby keeler )  wants a chance to dance ;  his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all ;  a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him ;  his partners are cheating him .  .  . my gosh ,  what's next ?  this may all sound like a lot to digest ,  but everything happens fast ,  with cagney bouncing ,  strutting ,  striding ,  finger-snapping ,  barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done .    instead of  " let's put on a show ,  gang "  we have  " we need to build three shows in three days ,  so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing .  "  these three super prologues are going to feature 40 chorines ,  spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract ,  with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses .  .  . the whole apollo movie house circuit !  exhaustion threatens ,  feet ache ,  but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes  ( which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour ;  you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic )  stay the course ,  dancing their hearts out ,  giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty .    and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses ,  one after the other on the same night ,  with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save chester's skin or not .    first up is  " honeymoon hotel "  with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness ,  with brides and grooms  ( some might even be married )  ,  bedrooms and beds ,  and doors with  " do not disturb "  signs .    then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of  " by a waterfall "  that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy .  this number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls ,  trees ,  fountains ,  a huge grotto with waterslides ,  a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a depression on .  berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization ,  human patterns ,  legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water ,  with a lot of underwater photography looking up .  the girls are sure game .  they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks .  the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting .  ruby keeler ,  who has a couple of quick shots in the water ,  is the only one who looks a bit cautious .    and finally ,  the smash finale .  .  . 11 minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to  " shanghai lil ,  "  with all sorts of bar girls and their customers ,  unusual in that the races are mixed up .  there's cagney and keeler dancing on the bar ,  dancing on a table ,  cagney fighting .  there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines ,  hupping back and forth ,  rifles tossed and caught .  then .  .  . this is true .  .  . a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle .  this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt ,  a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes .    that's entertainment ,  folks .  it's great !    of course ,  chester's prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester .  the movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile .  ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along .  joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality .  the movie ,  however ,  belongs to cagney ,  who grabs and shakes it ,  and to berkeley ,  a man for whom too much was never too much .
1	james cagney is best known for his tough characters- and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot 'soft' characters in his career .  this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in .   cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing .  and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it .  he plays the role with a lot of confidence .  he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time ,  so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career .  he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in .   the movie is directed by lloyd bacon ,  who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre .  his earliest '30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as  " 42nd street "  .  his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really .  '30's musicals never were really about its singing ,  this was something that more featured in '40's and later made musicals ,  mainly from the mgm studios .   as usual it has a light and simple story ,  set in the musical world ,  that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way .  it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch .  so do the characters and actors that are portraying them .  sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie ,  when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines .   the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done ,  even though i'm not a too big fan of the genre itself .  once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty .  he often played little boys/babies/mice and whatever more early on in his career ,  including the movie musical  " gold diggers of 1933 "  ,  of one year earlier .    a recommendable early genre movie .   8/10
1	i have a feeling that the warners bros depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years .  yes ,  we are in the economic doldrums  ( or have you been living under a rock )  and times look bleak .  but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles .  in the 30's ,  film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .   " footlight parade  ( 1933 )  "  was one such film that audiences flocked to .  while this lloyd bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as  " gold diggers of 1933  ( 1933 )  "  does ,  it's still a wonderful showcase of talent .  we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers ,  but boy ,  are they worth waiting for me .  yes ,  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress ,  and her tapping is so-so ,  but busby's magical  " by a waterfall "  whisks her ,  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls ,  into a dizzying water wonderland .  of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage  ( they defy limits of gravity ,  for one thing )  ,  and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough ,  wisecracking non-musical scenes .  and  " footlight "  also has james cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals  ( really ,  what couldn't this man do ?  )  .  he even gets to take over from the leading man ,  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  ( who is really little ruby in china-girl wig !  )  . he co-stars with joan blondell ,  his adorable ,  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  ( until the final reel ,  that is )  .  apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife .  and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .
1	an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's .  audiences must've been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle .  quite a contrast from his  " public enemy "  2 years earlier .  cagney does add spark & interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline & plot .  but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back .  first with the conservative  " honeymoon hotel "  number , then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  " by a waterfall "  sequence , followed by the closing  " shanghai lil "  sequence ,  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler .  the  " shanghai lil "  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic after the more exciting & incredibly mind boggling  " by a waterfall "  choreography . if i was the director i would've inserted the  " shanghai lil "  number in the middle & close with  " by a waterfall "  , which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak & in my view the best of the 3 numbers .  the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake & james cagney's performance is added decoration to the cake .  an outstanding musical achievement , a 4 star movie ,  the ultimate musical , well worth watching , you won't be disappointed !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
1	this is a wonderful film .  the non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate .  the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated .  i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts .  joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together .  some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies .  put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is .
1	fast-paced ,  funny ,  sexy ,  and spectacular .  cagney is always terrific .  blondel charms you with her wit and energy .  it's obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the innuendo in the script ,  the costumes , and the way they touch each other .  and bikinis before there were bikinis !  this is no holds barred fun for everyone .  i don't understand the john garfield issue though .  does it matter whether or not he's in this film ?  if he is ,  he screen is so short that he's basically a prop .  you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there .  i'm a big cagney fan ,  but had never seen this one before .  i found it on turner classics .  i found it by wonderful accident .  sit back and enjoy the ride !
1	when it came out ,  this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment .  to this day it's more entertaining than most ,  in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty  " girl friday "  played by joan blondell .  also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes .   but this is a pretty strange movie .  i mean in one of those numbers ,  you've got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler ,  doing all kinds of weird stuff .  ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times ,  but at least she's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films .  you'd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie ;  apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney .  as for cagney ,  his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time .  after a while it gets a bit too much .  you expect him to walk out and say ,   " hey !  i've got a great idea for a prologue !  the women are cigarettes ,  and they come out of a pack of smokes !  oh no ,  we did that one last month !  "  it's funny but it gets a bit repetitive .  in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl ,  ruth donnelly ,  some of the established cagney gangster character comes out .  in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching ,  and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very  " street "  even though the characters aren't criminal .   the musical numbers .  .  .  what can you say ?  they stand alone as entertainment ,  the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling .  but none of them really mean anything .  it means  " honeymoon hotel "  ,  nothing really more or less .  and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately ,  since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays .  for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper ,  things like that .  the whole thing could only exist on film ,  so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous .  i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so ,  because this is a very polished production .   it's great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills ,  and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler .  cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well .  the music i would say is only mediocre ,  but mostly pleasing if repetitive .  bacon's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting .  the film's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way .  it's a cut above most  " let's put on a show "  films of the 30s .
1	of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film .  from that point of view it is utter fantasy .  but who cares ?  it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane ,  battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching .  films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes . it is about what cinema does best :  great camera-work ,  great settings and great performances .   the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented ,  keeping the best till last .   i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and .  .  .
1	" footlight parade "  is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros .  produced in the early 1930's to ward off the depression .   " 42nd street "  and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era ,  and they made literally ,  millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while ,  and enjoy themselves .   while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell ,  ruby keeler ,  and dick powell ,  only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney .  almost ten years prior to his most well-known musical ,   " yankee doodle dandy "  .  here he dances in that most original of dance styles ,  with his arms usually lowered at his side ,  and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks .  it's easy to see that he is enjoying himself ,  and that makes us enjoy him all the more .   while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film ,  they are well worth the wait .  i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code ,  so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqué .  but it's all in fun .   it doesn't matter what the plot of the film is ,  just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast .  besides those already mentioned ,  guy kibbee is at his flustered best here .   7 out of 10
1	the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues  ( those staged performances ,  usually musical ,  that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days )  must deal with crooked competition ,  fraudulent partners ,  unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade .   while closely resembling other warner's musical spectaculars ,  notably the golddigger films ,  this movie had a special attraction none of the others had :  jimmy cagney .  he is a wonder ,  loose-jointed and lithe ,  as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie .  cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go ,  powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm .   the rest of the cast gives their best ,  as well .  joan blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed ,  big-hearted blonde secretary ,  infatuated with cagney  ( major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number ?  )  .  dick powell & ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage & off ;  the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing  ;  powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead .   guy kibbee & hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law ,  both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways .  ruth donnelly scores as kibbee's wealthy wife ,  a woman devoted to her handsome protégés .  frank mchugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney's wit .  herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger .  mavens will spot little billy barty ,  jimmy conlin & maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers .   finally ,  there's busby berkeley ,  choreographer nonpareil .  his terpsichorean confections ,  sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's ,  were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy .  the big joke about berkeley's creations ,  of course ,  was that they were meant ,  as part of the plot ,  to be stage productions .  but no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination .  they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera .   berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches ,  either a story  ( often rather bizarre )  told with song & dance ;  or else stunning geometrically designed numbers ,  eye candy ,  featuring plentiful chorus girls ,  overhead camerawork & a romantic tune .  in a spasm of outré extravagance ,  footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks :  `honeymoon hotel' and its pre-production code telling of a couple's wedding night ;  `by a waterfall' - dozens of unclad females ,  splashing ,  floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs  ( peer closely & you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved )  ;  and finally ,  `shanghai lil' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney & berkeley .
1	i thought this had the right blend of character ,  plot ,  futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board .  it will take a while to get going ,  but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at .  i like the attitude too !  certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories .
1	gotta start with ed furlong on this one .  you gotta .  god bless this kid .  $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life .  he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script .  you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting .  maybe that's why his performance was good .  same with madsen .  you keep thinking ,   " i bet this guy is really like this in real life .  "  does madsen even have to act ?  just natural .  vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy .  i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance .  her reactions are spot-on in this film .  i battled if she was hot or not ,  but realized i would just like to see more of her .    not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films .  but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing .  it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank ,  they kill hostages ,  and the good guys win in the end type of film .  the twists keep on coming .  .  . and coming .   the café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there .  not glossed over a bit .  think like bourne ultimatum  " lite "  style on some scenes in the café .   and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne  ( who plays karl )  will make you do a double take .  these guys are twins .   as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town .  made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents .  but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of .  and some of them are smoking hot .  moncia dean ?  need i say more .
1	this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic conditions during the 30's .  remember ,  10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then ,  so this was a minor luxury for many people .  it's testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself .  you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type-cast in similar movies ,  e . g .  james cagney ,  william powell ,  ruby keeler ,  frank mchugh ,  joan blondell and guy kibbee  .  then too ,  branches of the u . s .  military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer ,  busby berkeley ,  at the end .
1	this is the best sci-fi that i have seen in my 29 years of watching sci-fi .  i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite .  the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today .
1	an opium den ,  a dirty little boy  ( actually a midget )  ,  prostitutes galore ,  a violent fracas in a dive ,  a motel for sexual shenanigans ,  scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot ,  a boozer falling down the stairs ,  a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with asians ,  africans ,  and anglos treated equally ,  does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall ?  wrong .  these are all scenes from a 1933 musical .   the first half of  " footlight parade "  is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film .  chester kent  ( cagney )  is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals .  his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day ,  john wayne in  " the big trail .  "  before each showing of the flick ,  a dance number is presented as a prologue .  shorts ,  news reels ,  serials ,  and cartoons would later serve the purpose .  kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business .  kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley .  could it be that cagney's character is patterned after berkeley ?  could be .    in preparation for the prologues ,  kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival .  he uncovers the traitor ,  fires him ,  then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress .  his assistant ,  nan prescott  ( joan blondell - soon to be mrs .  dick powell )  has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress .  a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain  ( dick powell )  who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn  ( ruby keeler )  .  the resulting three prologue musicals ,  which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day ,  are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago ,   " honeymoon hotel ,  "   " by a waterfall ,  "  and  " shanghai lil .  "   of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy james cagney .  like fred astaire and bill  " bojangles "  robinson ,  cagney's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed ,  although hours went into practice to get each step just right .  not as good a singer as astaire ,  cagney's singing ,  like astaire's ,  sounded natural ,  unlike the crooning so popular at the time .  it's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney .   most critics prefer the  " shanghai lil "  segment over the other two .  yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of  " by a waterfall "  is astonishing .  how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated .  the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see .  the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color .    though not nearly as socially conscious as  " gold diggers of 1933 ,  "   " footlight parade "  stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen .
1	it has singing .  it has drama .  it has comedy .  it has a story .  it's one of the greatest movies ever made  .  .  .  period .  if you can't enjoy this movie ,  then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray .  in  " yankee doodle dandy "  james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award ;  but in this movie he is better !  this is james cagney at his quisessential best !  he's fast with the one-liners !  he's fast with his feet !  it's nonstop action .  and the song-and-dance skits are classics ,  especially  " shanghai lil .  "  and the supporting cast is great ;  and the entire movie is upbeat ,  fast moving ,  and exudes confidence .  and even though this movie was made over 70 years ago ,  it's still watchable ,  even today .  and of course ,  this movie features miss ruby keeler  ( who was married to al jolson )  .  she is the perfect partner for james cagney  .  .  .  and dick powell too !  if you like upbeat ,  fast paced movies ,  with lots of singing and dancing ,  this is the movie to watch .
1	the stock market crash of 1929 and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater ,  in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville .  those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front .   in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy ,  out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea .  stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters .  some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on .   footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film .  it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy .  in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot ,  he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films .  he wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had .   of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason .  but it's so creative and fun to watch .    dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade ,  ah the moon is here ,  honeymoon hotel ,  and by a waterfall ,  the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team .  ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade ,  shanghai lil .    joan blondell is cagney's no nonsense girl friday at the theater .  like in blonde crazy ,  she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones .  one of blondell's best screen roles .   look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them .  john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number .  and in a scene at the beginning of the film ,  producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne .  the duke's voice is unmistakable .  but what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade .  i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there .  i've got to believe that clip was deliberate .   footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best .
1	" footlight parade "  is fascinating on so many levels .  there is no way the supposedly staged  " theater prologues "  could have been produced in any theater on earth ,  of course .  think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for  " by a waterfall ,  "  for instance .   ( berkeley directed john garfield in  " they made me a criminal "  six years later and had the dead end kids singing  " by a waterfall "  as they took their showers .  )     " shanghai lil "  is the best production number in the picture .  it's a catalog of '30s warner bros .  sensibilities .  note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes .  you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house .  here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others .  i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a  " card section "  presentation of roosevelt's image .  there's also the nra eagle--the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal .  fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression .  you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm ,  of course .  warner bros .  wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f . d . r .  administration .    dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker ,   " lil .  "  she hardly even watches her feet as she dances ,  which was one of her signature flaws .    the pre-code stuff is fun .  the  " by a waterfall "  number is wonderful in that regard .  the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on .  the spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years .  in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .
1	footlight parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy extravaganzas .  a snappy script and an all-star cast including jimmy cagney ,  the lovely joan blondell ,  dick powell ,  and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest .  directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley ,  this film will have you grinning from ear-to-ear from start to finish .   busby ,  of course ,  is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with  " gold diggers of 1933 "  and  " 42nd street "  to his credit  ( as dance director )  .  footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily-clad chorus girls ,  a berkeley trademark .  the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close-ups of the dancers .  his obsession with shapely legs and  " rear-view "  shots is amply demonstrated here .  the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing .   our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent ,  a producer of  " prologues "  or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown .  he's surrounded by crooked partners ,  a corporate spy ,  and a gold-digging girlfriend .  although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville ,  this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents .  joan blondell is memorable as cagney's wise-cracking ,  lovestruck secretary .  and ruby keeler is adorable ,  as always .   the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers ,   " honeymoon hotel "  ,   " the waterfall "  ,  and  " shanghai lil "  ,  each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today's hollywood where so-called  " special effects "  have replaced creative cinematography .   claudia's bottom line :  clever and erotic ,  with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid .  a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp .
1	a very early oliver stone  ( associate- ) produced film ,  and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman  ( co-founder and president of the world's only real independent film studio troma ,  creator of the toxic avenger and ,  at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival ,  lifetime-achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years )  .  having raised the money for this film on his own ,  lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself .  but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore .  indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd's version of his own script - as one of the world's most original ,  daring ,  experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has .  but as it is we have the gershuni-directed film .  and weather it is due to the strong script ,  or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own ,  sugar cookies is a very intelligent ,  highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives .  the shoestring budget the small studio  ( this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now ,  michael herz ,  formed troma )  had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive ,  indeed does not have a  " low budget "  look at all .  the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone  ( played by enigmatic mary woronow )  and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story .  this leads to a succession of plot-twists ,  mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock's vertigo and at least as inventive .  the atmosphere is a lot grimmer ,  though ,  and some comparisons to nicholas roeg's and donald cammell's performance come to mind .  in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end ,  which ,  along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to kaufman's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what's the fuss ,  makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour .  certainly one of the best films in troma's library ,  and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste .  the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry  ( later seen in george romero's the crazies )  ,  thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself .  highly recommended .
1	this movie is not schlock ,  despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions .  a dark fable for adults .  exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies ,  and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme .  a weird movie with enticing visuals :  shadows and contrast are prominent .  definitely worth a look ,  especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence .  through all the cruelty and wickedness ,  a moral ,  albeit twisted ,  can be gleamed .
1	starting off ,  here's a synopsis :  porno queen alta lee  ( lynn lowry )  is murdered by her pornographer lover max  ( george shannon )  in a game of sexual russian roulette .  alta's other lover ,  icy lesbian casting agent camila stone  ( mary woronov )  ,  provides an alibi for max .  but camila has an agenda of her own ,  and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie  ( lynn again )  in a web of sexual mind games .  when the lookalikes' identities are sufficiently blurred ,  the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter .   though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention ,  i find it to be a sexy ,  suspenseful gem .  cult goddess woronov has one of her best-ever roles ,  and she and sexy-innocent lowry play off each other well .  the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley ,  plus two original songs  (  " all-american boy ,  "   " you say you've never let me down "  )  and the jaynetts'  " sally ,  go 'round the roses "  compose a memorable soundtrack .  theodore gershuny's direction is sharp ,  with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society's upper crust .  with tons of great new york atmosphere ,  ondine  ( woronov's friend and fellow warholite )  giving a great performance in a small role ,  and exotic monique van vooren as max's ex-wife in a comic sub-plot .  this sub-plot ,  though amusing ,  looks like it belongs in another movie altogether .  however ,  i'm not complaining ,  as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out .   trivia :  sugar cookies was originally rated x  ( soft-core )  and released by general film corporation in 1973 .  i am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster--lucky me !  in 1977 ,  the movie was cut for an r and re-released by troma team ,  which now offers it uncut on videotape .  mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time ,  and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera .  she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions ,  kemek  ( 1970 )  and silent night ,  bloody night  ( 1972 )  .
1	i enjoyed longstreet ,  which followed in the steps of raymond burr's successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition .  but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided--i believe wrongly--that longstreet was not able to compete with mr .  burr's ironside .   i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable .  i hope that a box set of longstreet will appear .   writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv .
1	this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience .   the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story .  and who could forget pax ,  the beautiful guide dog in the series !   whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series ,  the settings  ,  in new orleans ,  the acting and the music  ( i note the comment about the music score in other comments  .  .  . i remember that clearly )  all work to make a good television series even better !   well you never know  .  .  . one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd !
1	i love this show ,  it's sure to be a winner .  jessica alba does a great job ,  it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who's not the cutesy type .  the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots .  everything is layed out well ,  and thought over .  to put it together must have taken a while ,  because it wasn't someone in a hurry that just slapped something together .  it's a great show altogether .
1	there is no denying that ealing comedies are good ,  but for me this film stands out as one of the best .   the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy ,  not the uk .  we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes ,  and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law ,  rationing does not exist .  when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system .   they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right .  in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started ,  that's where the moral comes in .  it's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender ,  only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food ,  lot's of it .  thus enabling them to continue their struggle .   this film hit's the right note throughout ,  the acting is superb ,  with stanley holloway ,  margaret rutherford ,  hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out .  it's pitched just right ,  not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat .  well worth a viewing
1	pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who ,  after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes ,  find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy .   this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them .  a solid cast of british stalwarts ,  especially stanley holloway ,  makes this more believable .   there are some very nice moments in the film ,  such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them .   even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again ,  the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens ,  leaving a nice happy feeling .   it's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later .  the producers must have got something right .
1	my cable tv has what's called the arts channel ,  which is a  " catch-as-catch-can "  situation sometimes ,  sometimes films ,  sometimes short clips of films or ballets ,  and i came into this just as the bar scene came on ,  where they tear up their coupons .  excellent ,  exquisite ,  ealing wins again ,  my wartime-glasgow-raised mother would love this ,  should i ever find a copy of it .  some of britain's best artists ,  from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford ,  having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office .  loved the last scene ,  where as soon as they are  " back in england !

1	passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema .  not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy ,  but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age ,  with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life .   stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton ,  who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb ,  discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years .   accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england  ( which has never been officially rescinded )  to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil ,  which means that in the eyes of international law ,  pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law unto itself .   this sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction ,  so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books ,  destroy and ignore their clothing coupons ,  flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc ,  declaring themselves fully independent from britain .   however ,  what then happens is ever spiv ,  black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border' into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods ,  and half of london's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration ,  making their quiet happy little haven ,  a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that .   appealing to whitehall for assistance ,  they are told that due to developments this is  " now a matter of foreign policy ,  which his majesty's government is reluctant to become involved "  which leaves the residents high and dry .  they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road ,  mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico .   eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege ,  with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food ,  but never the less fighting on in true british style .  as one bugundian resident quotes ,   " we're english and we always were english ,  and it's just because we are english ,  we are fighting so hard to be bugundians "    a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them ,  by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades .   will whitehall ,  who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners ,  especially as these ones are english !  !  !  !    great tale ,  and great fun throughout .  not to be missed .
1	my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer ,  today a writer and journalist ,  has put forward the theory that ,  just as british film-makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called  " thatcher's britain "  ,  the ealing comedies were intended as satires on  " attlee's britain "  ,  the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election .  this theory was presumably not intended to apply to ,  say ,   " kind hearts and coronets "   ( which is ,  if anything ,  a satire on the edwardian upper classes )  or to  " the ladykillers "  or  " the lavender hill mob "  ,  both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature .  it can ,  however ,  be applied to most of the other films in the series ,  especially  " passport to pimlico "  .   pimlico is ,  or at least was in the forties ,  a predominantly working-class district of london ,  set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station .  it is not quite correct to say ,  as has often been said ,  that the film is about pimlico  " declaring itself independent "  of britain .  what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy .  this means that ,  technically ,  pimlico is an independent state ,  and has been for nearly five hundred years ,  irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants .  the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly ,  but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply .   because pimlico is not subject to british law ,  the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please ,  unhindered by the rationing laws .  when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets ,  the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black-marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the  " burgundians "  ,  as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves ,  to surrender .   many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system ,  either as an individual as happens in  " the man in the white suit "  or  " the lavender hill mob "  ,  or as part of a larger community as happens in  " whisky galore "  or  " the titfield thunderbolt "  .  the central theme of  " passport "  is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government-imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties .  the film's particular target is the rationing system .  during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism ,  but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime .  it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945 ,  and organisations such as the british housewives' league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing .  i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the  " spivs "   ( black marketeers )  ,  who play a relatively minor part in the action ,  or the housewives' league ,  who do not appear at all .  the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats ,  who are portrayed either as having a  " rules for rules' sake "  mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all .   i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino .   ( indeed ,  i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film )  .  in 1949 ,  however ,  four years after the end of the war ,  the film-makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity ,  so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain .  one of the best-known lines from the film is  " we always were english and we always will be english and it's just because we are english that we're sticking up for our right to be burgundians "  .  there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense ,  tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico ,  all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics .   most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave ,  but in the last scene ,  after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain .  global warming may have altered things slightly ,  but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief ,  whatever statistics might say to the contrary ,  that britain had an abnormally wet climate .  the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important .   there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton ,  the grocer and small-time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico ,  and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor .  in the main ,  however ,  this is ,  appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together ,  an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film .  it lacks the ill-will and rancour of many more recent satirical films ,  but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that .  it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and ,  with the possible exception of  " kind hearts and coronets "  is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies .  10/10
1	every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state .  i do not think this is the point of the film at all .  the film parodies the spivs ( small time criminals who ran the blackmarket )  and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation .   yes of course the film sends up the political/social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society , they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign .   but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before .
1	i commend pictures that try something different .  many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas ,  so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico .   the movie is set just after ww2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners  " barmy "  .  the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called pimlico .  they ,  too ,  are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it .  that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago !  with this document ,  they reason ,  they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live life just as they want ,  since it turns out they really aren't british subjects !  where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you'll need to see for yourselves .  leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem !
1	very funny ,  well-crafted ,  well-acted ,  meticulous attention to detail .  a real window into a specific time and place in history .  could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe .  interesting how passport to pimlico anticipates the berlin airlift .  a definite 10 .
1	spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence .  in an early episode of cartoon  " family guy "  the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there .  way back in 1949 however ,  the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea .   after a child's prank ,  the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure .  at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy .  withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain ,  the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state .   based at a time when rationing was still in operation ,  this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring .  featuring performances by stanley holloway ,  betty warren ,  philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey ,  the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation .  these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines .  feeling remarkably fresh ,  despite being over 50 years old ,  the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained .   ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence .  with films like  " passport to pimlico "  it's not difficult to see why .  amusing from start to finish ,  the story is always fun and always worth watching .
1	this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london who ,  through an unusual set of circumstances ,  discover they are not english ,  but are an annex of the french province of burgundy .   the film features comic actor stanley holloway  ( best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady )  ,  as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period .   the story was apparently based on a news item at the time ,  when the canadian government  " officially "  gave a hotel room to a visiting european member of royalty .  the idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the hutt river province in western australia ,  where a landowner  " seceded "  from the australian government due to a wool quota dispute .   ( it was never acknowledged by the western australian or australian governments )  .   this is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues ,  rather like the tv show  " yes minister "  ;  as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .
1	dark angel is a cross between huxley's brave new world and percy's love in the ruins--portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order ,  both in the worst sense of the word .  once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by  " the pulse ,  "  it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters--max  ( the dark angel/bike messenger )  and logan  ( the rich rebel )  .  it seems uneven ,  perhaps a result of a variety of authors ,  but is held together by the energetic ,  beautiful ,  and charming jessica alba ,  who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive .  i think that fox has done it again .
1	this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london ,  in this case pimlico ,  were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws ,  taxes & post-war restrictions .  merry mayhem is what would happen .   the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago ,  a small historical footnote long since forgotten .  to the new burgundians ,  however ,  this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please ,  free from any interference from whitehall .   stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations .  dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico .  others in the stand-out cast include hermione baddeley ,  paul duplis ,  naughton wayne ,  basil radford & sir michael hordern .   welcome to burgundy !
1	i have to say i totally loved the movie .  it had it's funny moments ,  some heartwarming parts ,  just all around good .  me ,  personally ,  really liked the movie because it's something that finally i can relate to my childhood .  this movie ,  in my opinion ,  is geared more towards the young gay population .  it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up .  all the taunting ,  name-calling ,  and not knowing is something i ,  like most other young feminine boys ,  will always remember ,  and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay .  so ,  i would definitely recommend seeing this movie .  probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
1	i get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon ,  disney and the like .  it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again .  when my daughters couldn't go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick ,  i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while .  i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different ,  i flipped the channels .  my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey's voice .  i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice-over work for a little duck  .  .  .  well ,  i couldn't change the channel !  my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together ,  the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed .  it's not necessarily a proponent for  " gay rights "  but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything .  i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another  .  .  .  .  too fat ,  too skinny ,  too feminine ,  being a bully ,  not being smart enough ,  only having one parent  .  .  .  .  you name it !  kids ,  as a rule ,  can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience .  my girls already accept others as they are and don't pick on others for being different .  my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they're picked on  ( one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often -- it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her !  )  .   so ,  those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it's an advocate for  " gay rights "  or are being forced to  " accept certain views "  ,  you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon .   and if you need it explained to you  .  .  .  .  well ,  you need more help than any television show could ever offer .
1	henry thomas showed a restraint ,  even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could've killed this movie ,  that kept the dignity of a redemption story and as for pure creepiness-sniffing babies ?
1	this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast .  david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussy-whipped southern husband .  the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film .
1	i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable .  it is a quiet ,  little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or  " big "  performances .  it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina .    henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker ,  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods .  toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life .  david srathairn plays truman lester ,  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive .  and david plays the bad guy to perfection .    there is much more to this film than first meets the eye .  filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music ,  it is worth watching .
1	henry thomas was  " great "  .  his character held my attention .  i was so  " into "  the story that i forgot it wasn't real .  i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was .  the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character .  the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring .  i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head ,  in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself .
1	this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen .  i love the backwoods feel of this movie .  the movie is very realistic and believable .  this seems to take place in another era ,  maybe the late 60's or early 70's .  henry thomas works well with the young baby .  very moving story and worth a look .
1	i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary .  what i love most about it is that it is understated and low-key ,  but deeply heartfelt .  henry thomas'  ( he played the child in e . t .  )  performance is masterfully inarticulate  ( he is supposed to be a man of few words )  .  david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain .  and miraculously  ( given that we're talking about a hollywood product here )  a baby serves as a main character ,  but one who doesn't act or have lines ,  but rather just is  ( & is luminous at that )  .  interesting to note that thomas' mysterious relationship w .  e . t .  was the core of that film ;  while his bond w .  the baby serves as the core of  " a good baby .  "   then there is the music--ah ,  what music !  !  gillian welch's tunes are wonderful & the entire score is gorgeous hill country music .   this film is wonderfully atmospheric .  i recommend it highly .
1	a sweet-natured young mountain man with a sad past  ( henry thomas )  comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her .  the town elders generally support him in keeping the child ,  though a local temptress  ( cara seymour )  thinks little of the new family .  a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman  ( david strathairn at his creepiest )  have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way .  this is a charming slice-of-life in the ozarks in the same vein as  " where the lillies bloom "  &  " the dollmaker "  .  all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple-living -- but not simple-minded -- american folk .  a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly-safe family viewing .
1	the first von trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves .  sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa .  europa tells a story of a young german-american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war .  he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train .  because of his job ,  he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany ,  meeting with the killing of traitors ,  and hunt for former nazi party members .  the society is suffering from corruption .  his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train .  by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains .  the atmosphere is astounding .  the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene .  just when you think you've seen a lot !  !  !  !  !  !  !  europe !  !
1	all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing .  the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis .  the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do .  the main actors and actresses i . e .  jessica alba michael weatherly etc .  make you forget you are watching a fictional t . v .  show they seem to make this show come alive .  all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
1	what another reviewer called lack of character development ,  i call understatement .  the movie didn't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory .  yes ,  there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of ,  but this was primarily a one-day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters' lives .  henry thomas's performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action .  good rental .
1	it's cheesy ,  it's creepy ,  it's gross ,  but that's what makes it so much fun .  it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable .  this movie is great to make fun of .  rent it for a good laugh .   the film centers around three women newscasters ,  during a time way before cellphones .  they go to a small town to cover a festival ,  but they can't get a room to stay the night .  and that's when they meet ernest keller .  he's creepy in a psycho kind of way .  and he offers to let them stay at his home .  but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there .   stephen furst's performance is so amazing as  " the unseen "  ,  that he really carries this film .  most of the movie is kind of dull ,  although finding out the truth of ernest's family is kind of interesting .    just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look .  barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy .    i consider the movie an old gem ,  hard to find and worth a look .
1	this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick  (  " carrie "  and others )  and barbara bach .  it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it .  this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time .  it seems that 3 young newswomen  ( karen ,  vicky ,  and jennifer )  travel to the small city of solvang ,  california to cover a festival when a mix-up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller  ( lassick )  and his strange wife virginia .  vickie stays behind ,  feeling ill ,  as the other 2 are off to film their story .  she is soon murdered at the house ,  in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system  ( she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement )  .  soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover .  jennifer is fighting with her  ( ex ?  ) lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home ,  her hosts  ( whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son )  devise a plot to try to murder her as well .  virgina does not totally agree with earnest's plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior .  here the film turns almost comic as junior  ( portrayed hysterically by stephen furst )  is a deformed ,  mentally deficient ,  manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary .  this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done .  the actors/actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick ,  furst ,  and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining !
1	three girls  ( an all-female media-crew ,  including cult-actress barbara bach ,  no less )  visiting a small town to cover a festival ,  end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague .  well-made little shocker ,  suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line  ( that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets )  .  one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing  ( as in :  vintage shock-material )  ,  and this is basically what the film thrives on .  performances & cinematography are pretty much above par  ( compared to many other late 70's/early 80's films in the same vein )  ,  but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax-scene in the basement-setting .  from the moment that  " keller junior "  character was introduced ,  his performance made my jaw drop open and it didn't close until the end of the film .  a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick  ( who was funnily wacko in  " one flew over the cuckoo's nest "  ,  and now utterly demented in  " the unseen "  )  take on one of the leading roles .
1	the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show .  the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable .  the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old ,  but good acting and production make the movie worth watching .  the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects .  i rated it an 8 out of 10 .
1	it's true that danny steinmann's  " the unseen "  is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot ,  no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades ,  but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film .  on the contrary ,  my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting .  the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival ,  but their hotel forgot to register their booking .  in their search for a place to stay ,  the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion .  one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house .   " the unseen "  can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics  " psycho "  and  " the texas chainsaw massacre "  .  the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films ,  like twisted family secrets in the cellar ,  voyeurism ,  crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens .  still ,  i don't consider these to be negative remarks ,  as  " the unseen "  is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade .  although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast ,  director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house  " unseen "  like the title promised .  the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre .  sydney lassick ,  immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in  " one flew over the cuckoo's nest "  is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller .  his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed .  also stephen furst ,  who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen ,  gives away a tremendous performance as  " junior "  .  he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving .   " the unseen "  is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff .
1	gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast ,  a television reporter who travels with her crew  ( karen lamm and lois young )  to solvang ,  california ,  to cover a danish festival .  the problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full .  so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly ernest keller  ( a phenomenal sydney lassick )  .  wouldn't you know it ,  ernest and meek partner virginia  ( lelia goldoni )  are hiding a big secret in their cellar :  pitiable ,  deformed ,  diaper-clad  " junior "   ( stephen furst ,  in a remarkable performance )  who ultimately terrorizes the girls .   a deliciously unhinged lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie .  it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax ,  delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour .  the hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of  " psycho "  here - are great settings .  most of all ,  the perverse plot involves incest and patricide ,  allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality .  and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls .  the final shot is especially sad .    " the unseen "  is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery .   8/10
1	get this film if at all possible .  you will find a really good performance by barbara bach ,  beautiful cinematography of a stately  ( and incredibly clean )  but creepy old house ,  and an unexpected virtuoso performance by   " the unseen "  .  i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach ,  whom i'd just viewed in  " the spy who loved me .  "  i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little .  so :  we start with a nice fresh premise .  tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town ,  solvang ,  that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival .  she brings along a camerawoman ,  who happens to be her sister ,  and another associate .   ( the late karen lamm plays bach's sister ,  and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to ,  it is just too funny watching bach  ( mrs .  ringo starr )  and lamm  ( mrs .  dennis wilson )  going down the street having a sisterly quarrel .  )  )  anyway  bach's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang ,  as he's not done arguing with her .  there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career .  the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station ,  only to find their reservations were given away to someone else .   ( maybe to bach's boyfriend ,  because think of it  where's he gonna stay ?  )  .  the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go .  mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum ,  they catch the interest of proprietor mr .  keller  ( the late sidney lassick )  ,  who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home ,  insisting his wife will be happy to receive them .  oh no !  next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife ,  warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along .  trouble in paradise !  the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes ,  but one of the girls doesn't feel good .  bach and lamm leave her behind ,  wondering to themselves about mrs .  keller  ( played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni )  who looks like she just lost her best pal .  speaking of which  under-the-weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub ,  not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole .  she hears him ,  thinks he's come to deliver linen ,  and calls out her thanks .  lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look .  after he's left ,  poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast  ( in a really decent ,  frightening round of action )  by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  the unseen !  lamm comes home next  ( bach is out finishing an argument with her beau )  and can't find anyone in the house .  she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen ,  and ,  on hands and knees to collect it ,  her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting the unseen again !  well ,  at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen ,  we do a flashback into mr .  keller's past and get the full story of what his sick ,  sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much .  bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are .  meanwhile ,  lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home .  he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us .   i cannot say enough for stephen furst ,  whom i'd never seen before ;  it's obvious that he did his homework for this role ,  studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged ;  bach and goldoni ,  each in their diverse way ,  just give the movie luster .  not only that ,  but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution .  no stupid cheap tricks ,  eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners .  .  .  a real treat for your collection .
1	los angeles tv news reporter jennifer  ( the beautiful barbara bach of  " the spy who loved me "  fame )  and her two assistants karen  ( the appealingly spunky karen lamm )  and vicki  ( the pretty lois young ,  who not only gets killed first ,  but also bares her yummy bod in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene )  go to solvang ,  california to cover an annual danish festival .  since all the local hotels are booked solid ,  the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a swanky ,  but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky ernest keller  ( deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late ,  great sydney lassick )  and his meek sister virginia  ( a solid lelia goldoni )  .  unfortunately ,  keller has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret residing in his dank basement :  a portly ,  pathetic ,  diapered ,  incest-spawned man-child mongoloid named junior  ( an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by stephen furst ;  flounder in  " animal house "  )  ,  who naturally gets loose and wreaks some murderous havoc .  capably directed by danny steinmann ,  with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast ,  a compellingly perverse plot ,  excellent make-up by craig reardon ,  a nicely creepy atmosphere ,  a wonderfully wild climax ,  a slow ,  but steady pace ,  likable well-drawn characters ,  and a surprisingly heart-breaking final freeze frame  ( the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch )  ,  this unjustly overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out .
1	upon the first viewing ,  i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales .  after many more ,  i think it's one of the best .  some of the songs are pretty bad ,  especially the love song ,  but two things stand out that make the movie ,  even the singing ,  worthwhile .  one is the art direction .  like the other cannon movie tales ,  this is a beautifully decorated period piece ;  every piece of cloth and jewel  ( both of which have major parts in this movie's plot )  look fresh and new ,  and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants .  even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess ,  wonderfully done .  the other thing is the comic timing .  a lot of the movie is cheesy ,  but the emperor's vanity  ( and his making fun of himself in the end )  ,  the suspicious guard ,  the guard chasing nicholas ,  and the stupid prince ,  were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose .  and the sequence during the song weave-o makes up for the songs that weren't so good .
1	i think this show is definitely the greatest show .  jessica alba does such a great job in it .  michael weatherly also does an awesome job ,  as well as the rest of the cast .  the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing .  it's like watching a 1-hour movie .  it's definitely worth watching .
1	simply put ,  this is the best movie to come out of michigan since .  .  .  well ,  ever !  evil dead eat your heart out ,  hatred of a minute was some of the oddest ,  and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time .  i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip ,  or a good case of the willies !
1	" hatred of a minute "  is a hauntingly beautiful film .  a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer ,  eric seaver .  strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a  " must see "  for any film student or horror fan .  the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies .  some shout outs to the film's producer ,  bruce campbell as well as to the film  " the evil dead "  add some humor for anyone that knows the genre .
1	michael kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as eric seaver ,  a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous ,  abusive ,  alcoholic stepfather barry  ( a genuinely frightening portrayal by gunnar hansen )  .  eric has a compassionate fiancé  ( sweetly played by the lovely tracee newberry )  and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue .  haunted by his bleak past ,  egged on by the bald ,  beaming jack the demon  ( a truly creepy michael robert brandon )  ,  and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother ,  eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree .  capably directed by kallio  ( who also wrote the tight ,  astute script )  ,  with uniformly fine acting by a sound no-name cast  ( jeff steiger is especially good as eric's wannabe helpful guardian angel michael )  ,  rather rough ,  but overall polished cinematography by george lieber ,  believable true-to-life characters ,  jolting outbursts of raw ,  shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence ,  a moody ,  spooky score by dan kolton ,  an uncompromisingly downbeat ending ,  grungy detroit ,  michigan locations ,  a grimly serious tone ,  and a taut ,  gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout ,  this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing .  a real sleeper .
1	i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews .  the movie is not great ,  but it has a lot of great elements .  the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great .  the story is slow and weak ,  but entertaining .  the acting is bad ,  but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel .  the music is pretty good and the gore is good .  it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell .  i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable ,  it was still enjoyable .  the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy .  the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up .  there was no sex scenes .  i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair .  i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do .  the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film ,  the devil is quite creepy .
1	" hatred of a minute "  is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years .  not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means ,  but it's definitely worth a watch .     " hatred "  chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver  ( played by director kallio )  ,  a formerly abused child now grown up ,  and starting to listen to his evil side .     " hatred "  is very nice visually .  the shots are creative ,  and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at .  this film actually has an element of production value to it ,  unlike other recent michigan releases like  " dark tomorrow "  and  " biker zombies .  "  subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's $350 , 000 budget .    however ,   " hatred "  stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do ,  and that's in the story and character department .  essentially ,  things just kind-of happen .  eric seaver doesn't evolve at all .  basically ,  he's always been crazy ,  it's just that people are starting to notice .  the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development .  also ,  the ending is very abrupt .    however- since this is a horror film ,  since when do we care about plot ?  we just want to see people die ,  and  " hatred "  certainly delivers .  as the body count mounted ,  people in the theater started cheering  " kill her !  kill em' all !  "  when people scream back at the screen ,  it's always fun .    that's the place where  " hatred "  succeeds .  it's fun .  and in the end ,  that's all that really matters .
1	this is a decent little flick made in michigan ,  about a guy that is haunted by his past ,  with his abusive stepfather  ( gunnar hansen )  and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted .  in fact ,  he's absolutely bonkers ,  but tries not to be too obvious .  he's got an entourage too ,  his own little demon & angel that follow him around .  the demon never says a word but really ,  doesn't have to ,  and he's max schreck-creepy .  let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this ,  as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better ,  like  " freeing "  people that he decides need it ,  mostly beautiful young women .  this is a decent portrayal of madness ,  and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on ,  but overall ,  i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest .  it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on .  a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks .
1	so what constitutes a real independent film ?  in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge ,  i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy .   which is why we should be glad that films like  " hatred of a minute "  exist .  across the board ,  this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template  ( indie horror film )  .  love it or hate it ,   " hatred "  isn't afraid of being what it is ,  and in watching this film ,  you get the real sense that kallio  ( the director )  didn't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place ,  he's in this to tell stories .  good ones .  you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store ,  but don't be fooled ,  this story is also about love ,  about good people pushed over the edge ,  and that oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel .   if you expect smut ,  or an evil dead ripoff ,  stay away from this film .  but if you dig the finer points of the horror/suspense genres ,  check this film out .   yes .  bruce campbell did produce this movie ,  and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not  " evil dead "  .  bruce has never tried to bank on his  " ash "  image ,  and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with  " hatred "  so that it could do so either .   my advice ,  though ,  to all dead-ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr .  campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr .  kallio and mr .  campbell are trying to show you .   the acting is well done ,  although nothing about this film is oscar caliber  ( perhaps intentionally )  ,  it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film .  so often ,  actors in films such as these don't even seem to try ,  with  " hatred "  ,  it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously ,  never resorting to typical horror-film campiness .   technically ,   " hatred "  is about as competent as indie film gets .  the editing is fast paced ,  the cinematography is good given the budget ,  and  " hatred "  keeps a quick pace ,  without any bog-down points or bad anti-climaxes .   all in all ,  hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi-million dollar fake indies ,  but personally ,  i don't see a problem with that .  it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium .  people who reached into thier broke ass pockets ,  pulled out thier nickles and dimes ,  threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie .   check this one out .
1	despite the occasionally stilted acting and  " seen-it-all-before "  story ,  this is a fairly compelling movie .   it has suspense ,  the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy ,  some of the visual effects are superb and best of all ,  no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film ,  as too many  ( wannabe )  horror films have in them now  honestly ,  this isn't the greatest film ever made ,  but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development  i was glad i watched it
1	michigan ,  edgar allen poe ,  a toaster ,  and a frying pan  .   .   .  if you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre ,  and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted ,  this is the movie for you .  an amazingly well developed first film ,   " hatred of a minute "  has all the draw of mainstream hits like  " silence of the lambs "  and of cult classics like  " army of darkness .  "  the editing and effects are well done ,  better than many films in the genre .  kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe's writings .  at a time when big budget ,  big name films lack much in the way of substance ,  the independent film has resurrected this dying trait .  if you love michigan ,  a good story ,  or a decent thriller go check out  " hatred of a minute .  "
1	i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words  " clueless and appalling nonsense .  "  i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment .  one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love ,  have a child and live together happily ever after .  but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart warmed .  is it so impossible ?  there are far more implausible events described in other movies .  the acting is good ,  the script is funny .  the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality .
1	this is an absolute great show .  jessica alba ,  besides being the most beautiful women in the world ,  is a great actress .  she does a great job of portraying max ,  and i could never see anyone else doing that role .  she is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous .
1	this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 .  it was a revelation to us .  we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children .  obviously we were wrong .  love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it .  but we both chose that love anyway .   and no ,  it never changed our sexual orientation .  that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos .   when we were young we both had affairs ,  but never with the opposite sex .  as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs .   this story is not far fetched .  however ,  the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me .  my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years .  we are still gay .  end of story .
1	this is a film for entertainment ;  i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film .  i personally find this film funny ,  audacious ,  and memorable .  it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess .  this film was done very well i might add ,  in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality .  this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not ,  it is however about love ,  in all it's strange forms .  this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood ,  or in california .  pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men .  women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career .  bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community .   then the fantasy begins !  !  let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have ?  well this movie ,  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  " the next big thing "  .  perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better .   i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now .  i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny ,  tender movie- to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun .  some people need to lighten up !  !  !  and this is the film you should do it with !
1	this movie is as unique as it is overlooked .  .  .  .  .  . a different story is just that ,  it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain ,  one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind .  i first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time .  i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life .  it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family .  this film should be available on dvd/vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster & perry king can be acknowledged ,  but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned .
1	in order to stop her homosexual friend albert  ( perry king )  from being deported back to belgium ,  stella  ( meg foster )  decides to marry him .  the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian .  the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party ,  they fall into bed and then into love .  later in the film after falling in love ,  stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing .  what she finds will leave the viewer stunned .  this is a great film ,  very original .  perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here .  very controversial upon its release in 1978 ,  the  " r "  rated film is now  " pg "  in this much more liberal time .   recently released on dvd ,  the disc contains a  " making of "  segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not  " real "  are mistaken .  everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved !
1	i appreciated the photography ,  the textures ,  the colours and often ,  unlike one comment ,  the lighting .  what was lacking for me was a coherent storyline . i found it often disjointed ,  badly edited and at times difficult to follow .  my version was 110 minutes ,  imdb shows one at 125m .  possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help .  i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed .  miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine ,  i just wanted a little more dialogue .  if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one ,  try 'hideous kinky'with kate winslet .
1	this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire ,  well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone ,  and learn about the people who lived there .   i enjoyed the story ,  characters ,  acting and scenes .  a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly ,  otherwise a wonderful piece .   the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it .  the scenes with her and alex descas  ( nadir )  are charming and lovely .   i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating .
1	harem suare is the best film i saw in the year 2000 .  bravo ferzan ozpetek .  sensually shot and stunningly portrayed ,  harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance ,  which is such a taboo in hollywood .  women of all shapes ,  sizes ,  and color ,  populate the film .  cut off from the outside world ,  the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue ,  rivalry and jealousies within their ranks .
1	when i think about this movie ,  all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world .  texture ,  smell ,  color ,  that's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of .  see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace ,  or the sweltering turkish bath ,  and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice ,  coarse cloth ,  smooth skin ,  scented oils ,  flickering flames ,  satin rustle .  don't just watch and listen ,  be absorbed ,  let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you .
1	dolph lundgren is back !  detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years ,  and that is following the delayed hidden agenda .  this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips ,  agent red and stormcatcher .  however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda ,  which was better in almost every respect .  what this film does have in it's favour from dolph's previous outing ,  is a sense of cheesy fun .  the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role ,  and it's good to see dolph doing his own stunts again .   the films story is ludicrous and prime b-movie material .  an ex-military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching ,  whilst taking a detention class ,  he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal .  the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches .  if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy .  thankfully the filmmakers don't take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability ,  this film has a so bad it's enjoyable kind of vibe .   where the film is let down is miss-using a fairly decent budget .  the budget of around 10 million has not been well spent .  it's all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination .  the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse .  there are some good moments .  you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning ,  with plenty of destruction .  the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen .    as for the cast .  hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages .  there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film .  this however has problems .  the actors are on the most part bad .  the bad guys are terrible ,  but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness .  the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters .  they all hate authority ,  each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons ,  but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability .  this movie is all about dolph though .  while this film is nowhere near his best ,  it is nowhere near his worst .  it also marks a turning point in his career .  he is now back in good shape ,  and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action .  dolph looks enthusiastic here ,  he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man  ( running from explosions in slow-mo ,  one liners ,  and handling large weapons )  again in a movie like his older ones ,  albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one .  it is good to see dolph looking energised .  his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary ,  and using doubles a lot  ( he still does all the fights himself though )  but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it .   overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode .  there's not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm .  **
1	this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion ,  with cool characters ,  lots of action ,  and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren ,  however alex karzis is awful as the villain !  .  the story is very good ,  and i found the kids to be likable for the most part ,  plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this !  .  the action scenes are excellent ,  and it's almost like die hard except it's set in a school !  ,  plus kata dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick !  .  the finale is very exciting ,  and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well !  ,  however i just wished it had another villain ,  because alex karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too ott ,  and laughable for my tastes .  this should be higher then 4 . 1 in my opinion ,  as i thought it was a great action film ,  and while the kids ,  were very stupid at times ,  they got quite resourceful as the movie went along !  ,  plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well !  .  the ending is very amusing , and corey sevier's character was my favorite student !  ,  plus dolph has still got it !  .  this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion ,  with cool characters ,  lots of action ,  and an amazing performance from lundgren !  ,  but alex karzis is awful as the villain ,  still i highly recommend this one !  .  the direction is very good !  .  sidney j .  furie does a very good job here with great camera work ,  good angles ,  and keeping the film at a very fast pace !  .  there is a bit of blood and violence .  we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds , knife in the side of the head ,  bloody arrow hits ,  an impaling ,  and other minor stuff .  the acting is fantastic !  .  dolph lundgren is amazing as always ,  and is amazing here ,  he is extremely likable ,  kicks that ass as usual ,  had great chemistry with the kids ,  had an awesome character ,  is very charismatic ,  and he may not have shown a great emotional rage ,  he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch !  ,  he is one of my favorite actors !   ( lundgren rules !  !  !  !  !  )  .  alex karzis is god awful as the villain ,  he is laughably ott ,  was boring ,  and not menacing at all ,  he also annoyed the crap out of me .  kata dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do ,  she was the real villain in my opinion !  .  corey sevier is funny as mick ,  he was my favorite student ,  and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half ,  i liked him a lot !  ,  he had good chemistry with dolph too .  dov tiefenbach ( willy )  , chris collins ( hogie )  , mpho koaho ( jay tee )  , danielle hampton ( alicia )  , nicole dicker ( charlee )  all do great as the students .  jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancée .  rest of the cast do fine .  overall i highly recommend this one !  .  ***1/2 out of 5
1	i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the season3 although season2 was not as good as season1 which is excellent indeed !  !  ! i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon .  ( failed !   : _ ( i am a chinese student and it's inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and $ )  . i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow !
1	this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick ,  it isn't going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie .  our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day .  sure the script isn't going to win any oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action .  dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes ,  and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well .  all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick ,  but youv'e seen it a million times before .
1	i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw .  it was a cool fun movie . dolph looked superbly cool on the bike . he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . he is now in a pretty good shape . the story was ok and the other actors were also passable . i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie .   but it also had its share of problems .  the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way .  another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing .  i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom .  the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers .  there should've been more bad guys .  last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy  ,  but that was due to the small budget .  overall the movie was a good movie . i enjoyed it . i would recommend others to watch it .  p . s .  now u r a dead beat cop .   ( some one-liners were also cool )
1	there has been a political documentary ,  of recent vintage ,  called why we fight ,  which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation .  it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq .  yet ,  a far more famous series of films ,  with the same name ,  was made during world war two ,  by hollywood director frank capra .  although considered documentaries ,  and having won oscars in that category ,  this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop ,  more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will ,  scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes .  that said ,  that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries  ( such as the bbc's lauded the world at war )  lacked ,  nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable .  they are skillfully made ,  and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store ,  i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase .  i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series .   rarely has something free been so worth invaluable .  while there are no extras on the dvds ,  and the sound quality of the prints varies ,  these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago ,  when racism was overt  ( as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era )  ,  and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts .  the seven films ,  produced between 1942 and 1945 ,  are prelude to war ,  the nazis strike ,  divide and conquer ,  the battle of britain ,  the battle of russia ,  the battle of china ,  and war comes to america .   overall ,  the film series is well worth watching ,  not only for the obvious reasons ,  but for the subtle things it reveals ,  such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars ,  rather than the modern singular ,  or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria .  yet ,  it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars .  the lesson of world war one  ( avoid foreign entanglements )  was not applicable to world war two ,  whose own lesson  ( act early against dictatorships )  has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since :  korea ,  vietnam ,  nor iraq .  the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times .  it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today ,  but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position ,  nor will you be the last .
1	the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe .    clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the  " allied bias "  turning out to be historical fact .  the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east .  the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds .    the disparity between hitler's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag ,  declaring  " peace in our time "  to this day has durable propaganda qualities .  here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options ,  freedom or slavery .  in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively .
1	adolf hitler's maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the u . s .  war department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the armed forces during world war ii .  hitler's plan was methodical and well conceived ,  starting with the conquest of eastern europe ,  expanding to the european heartland ,  then moving on to the 'world island' consisting of europe ,  asia and africa .  his final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the americas and the world .   in 1935 ,  hitler ordered national conscription ,  as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell .  grade school children sang his praises ,  and young german boys received training and indoctrination in military camps .  marching unopposed into austria in 1938 ,  hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland .  in 1939 ,  hitler took all of czechoslovakia .  later in the year ,  the world was stunned to learn that germany signed a non-aggression pact with it's mortal enemy russia ,  a ploy to delay hitler's military involvement on too many fronts .  immediately after ,  germany invaded poland ,  bringing hitler's conquest right to russia's doorstep .  he would deal with her later .   it was during this period that britain still declined to oppose hitler's thrust across europe .  prime minister neville chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with germany ,  his infamous declaration stating 'peace in our time' .  it didn't turn out that way .   the most fascinating information to be learned in this installment ,  at least to me ,  was provided by a small snippet of footage from a german pro hitler rally in the mid '30's .  it was led by a german american taking his cue directly from the homeland .  the venue - madison square garden !
1	this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war .  the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise .   every school child ,  nay ,  every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos .  history has been repeating itself over and over again !  the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking ;  the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups ,  are still working to these evil group's advantage .   by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - france ,  america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths .  americans ,  french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties .   these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs .  they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them ,  fighting hitler .  this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .
1	i can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film .  it was truly a lot of fun .  the special effects were wonderful .  i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters ,  but not this time .  i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn't enjoy the film .  i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen ,  but again this was not the case .  to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time .  blair witch and the mummy .  both films that i thought were terrible .  blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time .  the mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck .  people liked it for it's special effects .  films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development ,  they are more like funhouse rides .  well with that analogy the mummy was a b ticket to the haunting's e-ticket .
1	what can i say that hasn't been said about  " the haunting "  ?  it has everything that would make a great picture .  wonderful sets ,  moody music ,  and sound design to die for were all in place .  the screenplay ,  though ,  sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird ,  surrealistic way .  the entire team must have forgotten to read it through ,  maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was .  each member of the cast gives a worthy performance ,  although with little conviction to the material at hand .  lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her .  but that's about it .  all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours ,  but you will definitely want more .  a lot more .
1	what can i say about it ? it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget ( 80 million dollars )  . not scary at all , it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace . a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more . catherine zeta-jones is beautiful as always , lili taylor is also a good actress . the architecture of the hill house is amazing , all these monuments , statues , furniture .  .  . delicious ! however i don't like the ending because it was so luscious . check this one out and form your own opinion on it . i give this picture 7 out of 10 .
1	i rented this movie this past weekend ,  cranked up the surround sound system ,  and got some great sound from special affects .  this movie is a great movie rental ,  the special affects where enough to scare my fiance ,  but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated .  i didn't go to the movies and see this ,  but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie .  i would recommend it !
1	dark angel is a futuristic sci-fi series ,  set in post-apocalyptic seattle ,  centering on max  ( jessica alba )  ,  a genetically enhanced young woman ,  on the run from her creators .   the dark angel universe is absorbing ,   ( not as much as say buffy ,  but absorbing nonetheless )  with an interesting and believable set of characters .  certainly ,  it is not for everyone ,  but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there .  dark angel is criminally overlooked ,  and under-rated ,  and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series .  which was a great shame ,  as this had the potential to become a great series ,  although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci-fi comedy red dwarf .  as it is dark angel remains unfinished ,  so seek it out ,  and if you want more ,  lobby fox to make another series .
1	some films just simply should not be remade .  this is one of them .  in and of itself it is not a bad film .  but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title .  liam neeson was excellent as he always is ,  and most of the cast holds up ,  with the exception of owen wilson ,  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke .  but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects .  again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film .  but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .
1	i don't know why the critics trashed this movie .  i hardly ever agree with them anyway .   the movie could have been a little scarier - i don't usually go to horror movies !  i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime .  i needn't have bothered !   ;  )   ( the cinema was full of kids too ,  heh !   ;  )   .  .  .  liam was great as always .  i also liked catharine zeta jones  ( theo )  and lili taylor  ( eleanor-nell )   the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way .  the special and sound effects were awesome .  i also loved the music score ,  particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children ,  how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power ,  peace and freedom .
1	i know it is fashionable now to hate this movie .  i have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films .  this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it .  yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts .  actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great .  i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time .  the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense .  the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring .  perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure .  the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963 .  it was even more scary .  see both and also the innocents and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin .
1	the haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house ,  good effects work and sound work ,  a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house .  there are scenes that make you jump ,  and the sinister aspects of what went on at hill house in the past ,  i found interesting .  there are genuinely creepy moments in the film and i liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets ,  curtains and the house itself .  jerry goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you .  what i wish could've happened is for something a little more intense .  jan de bont had a pg-13 rating to contend with and i think that he held back a little too much .  poltergeist scared me silly when i saw it many years ago ,  and it still holds up .  the haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror .  the ending was for me ,  a little anticlimactic .  overall ,  i enjoyed it .  the acting is good and there are moments that make you jump .  i just wish it scared me more .
1	it seems to be a perfect day for swimming .  a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach .  unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising .  the woman  ( barbara stanwyck )  takes the car and searches for help .   john sturges' short movie  ( 69 minutes )  is powerful because of unanswered questions .  stanwyck finds a guy who could help ,  but there is a price she has to pay for this .  there is a double question the movie poses .  how far would you go to help the man that you love ,  and on the other hand - observing stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - does she really love her husband ?  like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself .
1	what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night .   " jeopardy "  was fantastic .  it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat .   barbara stanwyck plays helen ,  who with husband doug  ( barry sullivan )  and son  ( lee aaker )  drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation .  husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope .   while there she runs into a psychotic killer  ( ralph meeker - one of my favourites )  and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband .   the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - i was not expecting such a great film .  but i suppose i should have realized - is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful ?
1	jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts - one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget/box office ones .  it's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets ,  and the only star is barbara stanwyck .  but what a star ,  of course .    stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert .  the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor ,  who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help .  some psychological battling there .    it's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it taut ,  and that stanwyck is great should go without mention  ( but i'll still praise her every time )  .
1	the only time i have seen this movie was when i was 10 years old .  i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it .  it just absolutely rattled me .  i was on vacation with my aunts in ft .  worth ,  texas and i will never forget it .  now ,  48 years later ,  my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult .  it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it .  i very much enjoyed it ,  but it gave me quite a scare !  jaqui
1	" i like cheap perfume better ;  it doesn't last as long .  .  .  "  - ralph meeker's convict character  ( lawson )  tells this to barbara stanwyck's helen character ,  after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in tijuana .  .  .  !  this line cracked me up ,  and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive ,  because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run !  i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen's attraction to lawson .  even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away ,  she did seem attracted to his fiery nature ,  and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn't likely wash away with the tide !
1	i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go .  when miss stanwyck starts her narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming .  the deserted area ,  the lock on the deserted gas station door ,  everything sets you up to wait for it .  .  . here it comes .  at first you think it will be about the little boy ,  but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in .  i found this movie to be really stressful ,  even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement .  now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating ,  maybe a white knuckles award ?
1	this show is so full of action ,  and everything needed to make an awsome show .  .  but best of all .  .  .  it actually has a plot  ( unlike some of those new reality shows .  .  .  )  .  it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base .  .  i totally suggest bying the dvds ,  i've already preordered them .  .  .  i suggest you do to .  .  .
1	jeopardy is a tense ,  satisying thriller ,  a cut above a b but not really a major production .  it qualifies as almost an experimental film ,  as the studio that produced it ,  metro ,  was desperately looking for new kinds of films ,  stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television .  the director ,  john sturges ,  was an up-and-comer whose best years lay ahead .  he had just recently begun directing a level films ,  and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman .  stars barbara stanwyck ,  barry sullivan and ralph meeker ,  were at very different phases of their careers .  stanwyck's glory years were behind her ,  and yet she could still carry a film ,  as she proves here .  barry sullivan ,  as her husband ,  was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him .  he was a fine ,  low-key actor ,  poised ,  but in an upper middle rather than upper class way ,  which made him excellent in professional roles .  as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save sullivan's life  ( he is trapped under a pier ,  and the tide is rising )  ,  ralph meeker is more energetic than usual .  this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and clift .  he was in his way as good an actor as either of them ,  but he lacked charisma .  his bargaining with stanwyck ,  which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband  ( by implication only ,  as this is 1953 )  ,  makes for an intriguing premise which ,  had this been a different kind of film ,  could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about stanwyck's character .  meeker is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan ;  and in her scenes with him stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son .  but as this is a formula picture ,  not a strindberg play ,  the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a fling , --leaving aside the question of her husband's predicament , --remains unexplored .  in this sense the incoming tide doesn't quite have the effect one might have wished ,  though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting ,  fine location photography ,  nearly all of it outdoors ,  and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr .  sturges .
1	leonard maltin must've been watching some other movie .   ( though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource ,  please disregard his comments on this one .  )  he states  " starts off well then fizzles "  when it's really the reverse -  " starts off tepid then catches fire "  .  the plot is about as simple as it gets .  happy mom ,  happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach ,  dad incapacitated in accident ,  mom runs off to get help ,  meets up with dangerous escaped convict .  mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life .   good white-knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker ,  appearing suddenly  ( the director ,  john sturges ,  films it in a clever way that will make you gasp )  around halfway through as the cunning ,  desperate criminal .  meeker is an unusually flippant ,  reckless actor  ( at least here and in the classic  " kiss me deadly "  )  and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and speeds off with the top down .  his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying  " pretty neat ,  huh ?  "  when he's especially pleased with his misdeeds .  there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage ,  barbara stanwyck ,   " don't go away "  .  she fires back  " where would i go ?  "   ( they're in the middle of nowhere )  and he realizes sitcom-ishly  " yeah ,  that's right "  .  the friction between them is a hoot .   there are flaws ,  somewhat ridiculous ones .  there's one scene where the police ,  who have been chasing after meeker for some time ,  stop stanwyck's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would ,  and pretends to be asleep as she's being questioned .  a .  he looks conspicuously un-masculine in this pose and b .  i think it's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion .   still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion .
1	here's an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc .  the first movie - and believe me the lesser of the two - is mgm's  " to please a lady "   ( 1950 )  in which she is paired with clark gable .  it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence .  here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins .  of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close .  a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck - two icons of the golden age - make it watchable !   but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature - a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called jeopardy .  produced by mgm in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one iota !  here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes .  a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what ?  yes , the tide is coming in .  with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance .  after driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict  ( ralph meeker )  who - in return for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes  (  " i'll do anything to save my husband "  )  .  does she or doesn't she ?  ?  .    meeker runs away with the picture !  he turns in quite a brilliant performance !  once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him !  an actor in the smouldering brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films .  although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury ,  disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding mann/stewart western  " naked spur "   ( 1953 )  and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in stanley kubrick's powerful ww1 drama  " paths of glory "   ( 1957 )  his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey spillane's  " kiss me deadly "  in 1955 .  his performance in  " jeopardy "  should have done wonders for him but he had only a so-so career in films .  he died in 1988 .   because of this release  " jeopardy "  can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir .  a memorable ,  taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances ,  tight direction by john sturges ,  the crisp monochrome cinematography of victor milner and an atmospheric score by dimitri tiomkin .  extras ,  however are no great shakes except for a radio version of  " jeopardy "  and trailers for both movies .   this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary .  hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around !   jeopardy - an mgm winner !
1	does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film ?  i love it !  one of my top 10 films of all time .  it just makes me feel good .  i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over !  !  !  bebe benson  ( michelle johnston )  is the babe of the film ,  imho !  i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film .  the two are like apples and oranges .  the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work .  i believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are .  this is a very good film ,  it is very satisfying .  that's all you need to know !
1	as a disclaimer ,  i've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years ,  and i only just saw the musical this week .  this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical  ( however ,  it tainted me when i watched the musical  :  )   )    i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role ,  along with kasey .  i think her 'let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie ,  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical .  the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical ,  as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger  ( easier to do in the movie of course )  .  the decors ,  lighting ,  dancing ,  and singing are also much superior in the movie ,  which should be expected ,  and was indeed delivered .    the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie ,  the new ones are quite good ones ,  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion ,  especially compared to a musical which has few decors .  the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking ,  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters ,  but their dancing is impeccable ,  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
1	when i really began to be interested in movies ,  at the age of eleven ,  i had a big list of 'must see' films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend ;  some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts .  i remember one of the films on that list was  " a chorus line "  and could never get it ;  so now to see it is a dream come true .   of course ,  i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there .  i mean ,  take  " a chorus line "  ,  a stage play turned into film .  i know it's something we see a lot nowadays ,  but back then it was a little different ,  apparently ;  and this film has something special .   most of the musicals made movies today ,  take the chance the camera gives them for free ,  to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places ;   " a chorus line "  was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie .  following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach  ( michael douglas )  ,  richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job .   everything happens on the same day :  the tension of not knowing ,  the stress of having to learn the numbers ,  the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage ,  where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences .  there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic ,  but they list shortens as the hours go by .   like a movie i saw recently ,   " a prairie home companion "  ,  the broadcast of a radio show ,  atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity .  on or behind the stage ,  things are going on ,  and time doesn't seem to stop .  again ,  i don't if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this ,  but it sure doesn't look like it ;  and anyway it's a great directing and editing  ( john bloom )  work .  but in that little stage ,  what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting ,  ronnie taylor's cinematography finds the way ,  making close-ups to certain characters ,  zooming in and out ,  showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york .   in one crucial moment ,  douglas tells the ones that are left :   " before we start eliminating :  you're all terrific and i'd like to hire you all ;  but i can't "  .  this made me think about reality shows today ,  where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving  ( even when they are not good )  .  it's hard ,  you must imagine ;  at least here ,  where all of them really are terrific .   to tell some of the stories ,  the characters use songs and ,  in one second ,  the stage takes a new life and it literally is 'a dream come true' .  the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws ,  showing these dancers' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett .  the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman ;  which is very touching at times .  so if it's not with a song it will be with a word ;  but in  " a chorus line "  ,  it's impossible not to be moved .   during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition ,  cassie ,  a special dancer played by alyson reed ,  takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it .  the words  " let me dance for you "  never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics .
1	i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway .  i love the broadway musical and i love the movie .  i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show .  i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies ,  so i developed a philosophy really early .  assume that the movie is going to be based on the book  (  or musical in this case )  but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same ,  it will be different so watch it for what it is .   i danced for 12 years before i had to make a choice .  i was a good dancer (  picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc )  but i wasn't super talented . i was however super talented as a show rider .  i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer  (  who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state )  that i had to make a choice when i turned 14 .  that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four-five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week .  .  and dedicate to one or the other .  so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies .  i just chose to watch this movie for what it is ,  it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction .  it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it .  i love the movie .  i love the broadway musical .
1	as many reviewers here have noted ,  the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story .  i have never seen the stage version of the story ,  and therefore i have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers .  perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film ,  but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer michael douglas' show .  the film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try-out group .  this way our attention is focused on the dancers' movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try-outs .  douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part .  apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one ,  and the backstage cliché-ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added .  i have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film .  the repeated intrusions cassie made during try-outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and/or luck .  however ,  this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past ,  and it's curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again .  the revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the  " i can do that "  number ,  but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories .  frankly ,  their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this .  *** of 4 stars .
1	this movie will always be a broadway and movie classic ,  as long as there are still people who sing ,  dance ,  and act .
1	this is a great film !  !  the first time i saw it i thought it was absorbing from start to finish and i still do now .  i may not have seen the play ,  but even if i had it wouldn't stop me thinking that the film is just as good .
1	i love this movie .  i mean the story may not be the best ,  but the dancing most certainly makes up for it .  you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them .  i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway .  .  .
1	anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly ,  i would refer them to roger ebert's review of this movie .  he is one of the most respected critics in the industry ,  and he gave it 3 1/2 stars .   this is a great movie .  it may not be perfect ,  or spectacular ,  but i enjoyed it .  a chorus line is not so much a story ,  as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls .  i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie .  that is an incorrect view .  it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls .  what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through .  and that i think is really the point of the whole show .  it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers ,  but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general .  this is a study of life as a broadway star .  anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through .    this is a great musical .  it has its slow points ,  and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines ,  but all in all ,  i thoroughly enjoyed it .  take a closer look at the movie ,  and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about .
1	hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i .  i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing  .  dancing and singing .  the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
1	i don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures .  basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england  ( but without the sentimentality of  " blackboard jungle "  )  .  the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate .  the estate looked like an old prison .  stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective ,  reassigned to the juvenile division -  " urgent ,  urgent - larceny - five iced lollies "  !  !  !  !  he finds he is the butt of many jokes .  david mccallum showed that he was one of britain's top young talents of the fifties .   ( he had a very different role in another stanley baker film  " hell drivers "  )  .  his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening .  ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie .  i wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it .   detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the  " firefly "  .  just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough ,  he is assigned to the juvenile division - he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work .  amid all the heckling he gets his first call out - the 6 year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops !  !  !   taking the twins home he meets their brother ,  the charismatic johnny ,  and their embittered sister cathie .  he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals .  as he gets more involved with the family ,  he realises there is a strong link between the fires ,  johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry .  the local priest  ( peter cushing in an unusual role ,  away from the hammer horrors )  explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero .  he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires .  the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear - the teacher  ( thinking only of her own safety )  runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman !  !  !  !   i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war .   highly recommended .
1	i've long wanted to see this film ,  being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum .  i agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time ,  but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role .  thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week .  i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war ,  especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s .  some of the boys are a bit scary .  i certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street ,  much less a dark one .  there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well ,  or as they call him ,  a firefly .
1	this film was shot on location in gerard gardens in liverpool ,  and was the uk's answer to films such as 'blackboard jungle' .  the film stands the test of time quite well ,  with all the moral stories still  ( or even more )  relevant today .  the film feature some fine performance from some notable british actors such as david mccallum ,  stanley baker ,  peter cushing and anne heywood .  baker plays a liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties ,  with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age ,  they will end up being responsible adults .   notable cameos in the film include freddie starr  ( fred fowell )  and melvyn hayes  ( gloria )  .  tsai chin and michael chow play brother and sister  ( they are real life brother and sister )  who are caught up in an arsonists web .  tsai chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest nicole kidman film 'the interpretor' .   violent playground features a gun siege in a school ,  so is unlikely to be shown on tv following similar events in scotland / russia .   i lived in gerard gardens where the film was shot  ( though was not born at the time )  ,  and have fond memories of the area .  i have recently completed a documentary on gerard gardens which includes extracts from 'violent playground' ,  and a small uk film 'coast to coast' which stars lenny henry and pete postlewaite .  the tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive .   there were some complaints from the residents when the film was released ,  as the film portrayed the area in a bad light .  time has helped heal those wounds .   a little gem of a film ,  i would recommend you seek this out
1	this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society ,  rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life .  in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool's junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents ,  who have been dealt with under this scheme ,  have not committed a second crime .  however ,  this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem .   stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer .  this hard-boiled character is a role typical of baker .  having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer .  however ,  as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events ,  back to his original investigation .   his first case leads him to the home of two young children ,  mary and patrick murphy  ( played by real-life brother and sister duo )  ,  who have committed a petty theft .  here he meets cathie  ( satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood )  their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with .  it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency .   the elder brother of the murphy family ,  johnny ,  is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums .  mccallum does an eye-catching turn as the americanized mixed-up kid ,  who owes more to the likes of marlon brando ,  than any previous british star .  one is reminded of brando's character johnny from 'the wild one' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film's 'johnny' leads his gang .   thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as 'the blue lamp' is not so apparent .  instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront .   the plot ,  whilst at times predictable ,  does deliver some memorable scenes .  the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music ,  leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant .  the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children ,  including mary and patrick ,  are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny .  obviously in the light of the real-life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying .  understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences .
1	like a lot of series pilots ,  dark angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet .  not that this is unusual in any way ,  but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more .  in today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation ,  the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused ,  with all guns blazing .   the ninety-minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together ,  and both episodes have a problem with focus .  in the first half ,  we are introduced to max and filled in on what drives her .  we also get a few interesting routines with max using her abilities to win bets ,  interacting with a pi ,  or sorting out co-workers' domestic problems .  the problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes ,  on television or otherwise .   it's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus .  throughout the two halves ,  max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time .  in the second half ,  the repercussions catch up with him ,  and max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess .  this sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series ,  and it works ,  but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning .  it's like most of the pieces are there ,  but a couple that make a complete image have been left out .  perhaps they get filled in with later episodes ,  but that's beside the point .  the fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty-eight less minutes .   the last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing .  original cindy in particular is an annoyance ,  and i doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes .  while the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap ,  it isn't of such quality that i'd commend it .  jessica alba is not the worst actor in the world ,  but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least .   the good news is that the premise and the production values are all top-notch .  in fact ,  this series was considered quite expensive to produce ,  and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season .  especially when there was ample time for both shows - they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality tv .  the fact is that we need more shows like dark angel ,  where imagination rather than overhype ,  are used to draw the attention .   in all ,  i gave the dark angel pilot a seven out of ten .  it never rises above the level of throwaway television ,  and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time .  but the potential is there ,  and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned .
1	one of the comedies of the 1970's .  also has the best signature tune of any comedy show .  the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred .  the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing .  a man and two women .  richard o' sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox .  its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success .   the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm .  the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements .
1	man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word .  the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp  ( played by the great richard o' sullivan )  who finds himself after a wild party ,  ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy .  ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate .  the obvious ends up happening as he moves in .   man about the house was a pre-cursor to cooke and mortimer's spin off show george and mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to jo ,  chrissy and robin .  these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred  ( the late and much missed yootha joyce )  in particular getting some of the best lines of the series .  a semi-regular character was larry  ( doug fisher )  a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something  ( and never to return it )  .   the american's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original .  thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script .  what a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard .   this programme is available on network dvd
1	as is nearly always the case ,  when britain comes up with an entertaining and/or successful sit-com or quiz show ,  the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own ,  grossly inferior ,  version .  man about the house is ,  of course ,  no exception to that rule .  the yanks' version  (  three's company  )  was unwatchable ,  braindead pap that seem to run forever .  a prime example of quantity over  (  non-existent  )  quality .  the original ,  on the other hand ,  is a fondly-remembered gem that had the savvy  (  like fawlty towers  )  to pull the plug at precisely the right time  (  unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity' that three's company came up with  )  .  jo was cute ,  there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers ,  richard o'sullivan made it all look so easy ,  the scripts ,  whilst not exactly oscar wilde-standard ,  were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop-dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell .  'nuff said .
1	i think dark angel is great !  first season was excellent ,  and had a good plot .  with max ( jessica alba )  as an escaped x-5 ,  manticore creation ,  trying to adapt to a normal life ,  but still  " saving the world "  .  and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice .   the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first .  the plot kinda disappeared ,  and the series lost a little of it's charm ,  mostly because of all the weird  " creatures "  appearing .  don't get me wrong the second season is good ,  but with a little bit to much of the  " manticores "  .  however ,  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2 ,  in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of .   so i really wish they could start making new episodes .  and with james cameron behind this it can't go wrong .  so as a conclusion i would say it's a great series ,  however i'm still hoping for a third season !
1	while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s - ab fab ,  men behaving badly ,  one foot in the grave ,  etc .  - the 70s were the real golden age .   in the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore ,  including the sexual revolution ,  feminism ,  and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for  " sensitivity "  that would ,  twenty years later ,  become political correctness .  attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not-so-subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty python's flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house .   ( by the late 70s this  " grappling "  resulted in more meditative and bitter-sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece butterflies .  )   man about the house is a perfect example of the good britcoms of the time - slightly genteel ,  cheeky ,  fresh ,  ingenuous ,  sometimes outrageous ,  with some well made observations on contemporary life .  compare it to a cynical 90s show such as ab fab ,  and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country .   man about the house is one of the great britcoms of the 70s ,  right up there with good neighbors  ( the good life )  ,  and about the house's spin off george and mildred .  its quality is attested to by the fact that - as with good neighbors - its creators ,  writers ,  and many of its cast have had continued success in british television .
1	some years ago ,  satellite channel u . k .  gold promoted repeats of 'men behaving badly' with the hype :   " here it is ,  the original flat-sharing sitcom !  "  .  this was in fact untrue .  'man about the house' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76 .   it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke ,  creators of the popular sitcom 'father dear father' .  when it ended ,  they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times .    in the first episode ,  chrissy  (  paula wilcox  )  and jo  (  sally thomsett  )  are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath .  he is robin tripp  (  richard o'sullivan  )  ,  a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode .  while his clothes dry out ,  he puts on a ladies' dressing gown and prepares them a meal .  they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay .  but there must be no naughty business .  so robin has to pretend to be gay .  .  .   on b . b . c . -2's 'i love 1973' ,  shown in 2000 ,  julie burchill claimed that 'house' showed her a way of life she envied .  she was not alone .  one of the most iconic  (  for me ,  anyway  )  images of '70's british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol ,  and a 'blind' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past .    a man living with two girls was a risqué subject for the time ,  but mrs . mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar ,  it was innocent ,  good-natured fun .  mortimer and cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it .   richard o'sullivan was still playing 'bingham' in i . t . v . 's 'doctor in charge' when this got started .  in fact the second run of 'in charge' overlapped with the first of 'house' .  he was born to play the sex-mad robin .  paula wilcox's 'chrissy' was more streetwise than 'beryl' ,  her character she played in 'the lovers' ,  while sally thomsett's 'jo' was a lovable dizzy blonde .  as time wore on ,  he became almost like an older brother to them .   for many viewers ,  brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers .  george had lost interest in sex ,  but mildred had not .  they went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'george & mildred' .  the late doug fisher was good value as as robin's wideboy friend larry .  he worked so well he was made into a regular .   within a year of its debut ,  there was the inevitable movie spin-off .  i am not a big fan of the 'man about the house' movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen .  most of its characters had never appeared in the series .   the format was sold to america ,  where it became the long-running 'three's company' starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers .  it was far more suggestive than the british original ,  with somers often seen in sexy clothing .   after six seasons ,  'house' ended with chrissy marrying robin's older brother norman  (  norman eshley  )  .  fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved ,  but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show - 'robin's nest' .
1	this is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents .  however ,  if you aren't yet a fan of the genre ,  i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one .  that's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots .  but ,  despite this ,  it's still a good film and kept my interest .   a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him .  the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief .  despite this ,  she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life .  however ,  the rent is due and there's no money ,  so the lady is forced to look for work .  she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal .  unfortunately ,  the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date .  well ,  like cinderella ,  she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her !  what to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her ?  !  well ,  see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved .  i didn't like how they handled the husband ,  as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd .  however ,  once he was out of the way ,  i do admire how the film also didn't give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends .   all in all ,  a very good film worth seeing ,  but certainly not great .
1	in watching this early demille work ,  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille .  his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable .  his pacing is very good ,  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so .  it is a pity that he wasn't as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films .   this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely .  she was remarkable ,  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions .   the ending is wonderful .
1	this film has a clear storyline ,  which is quite unusual to the musical genre .   " cats "  ,   " phantom of the opera "  ,  and other andrew lloyd webber's musicals can be considered metaphorical ,  as they use literary works as their framework .   " biarkan bintang menari "   ( bbm ) 's storyline touches the very core of human relationships ,  especially that of indonesian people .  despite the fact the film was based on a  " supposedly "  fairytale ,  it's actually a fantasy of the 'child' in indonesian adults .  the dance sequences are not perfect ,  yet the songs represent how indonesians express themselves .  i reckon the choreographer should explore indonesian way of dancing ,  by not dismaying the fact that indonesia's dance development tends to be more westernized .  the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and/or music .  yet ,  i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of indonesian film genre which i hope to improve in the future .
1	and i am a nicole kidman fanatic .  i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book ,  which ,  for all i know ,  she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie .    all four of the principals are excellent ,  but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing .   while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie ,  this one asks too much of the viewer .    it could have been very funny  ( which it is in parts )  or quite frightening  ( which it is in one scene )  but the director didn't seem to know which way to go .
1	i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film .  for one ,  i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre ,  but given this ,  the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all .  this is british comedy at its finest - dark ,  quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are .  i must stop short ,  however ,  of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone ;  i went to see it with several people ,  some english ,  some european and some american and while some of us loved it  ( mainly from the first two groups )  ,  some hated it and found it worthless .  if you think you're into this kind of thing then go .  if not ,  don't .  10/10 .
1	i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film ,  apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet .  that and it had nicole kidman in it .  i absolutely loved the film though ,  and came out thinking 'wow' .   refreshingly down to earth ,  the film moves along nicely ,  with a few suprises at each corner .  the relationships in the film are believeable ,  with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully .  the humour is subtle ,  with some great 'office'-like scenes at the bank ,  and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood .   overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation .  it's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships .  brit-filmmaking at its best .  .  .    ( 9/10 )
1	as usual ,  hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie .  but ,  this one is a classic - from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman !  !  well done .  even facial expressions were great !  language was perfect  ( even in russian language )  and nicole did a splendid job !  !  hey guys - you get what you pay for :  )
1	excellent movie ,  albeit slightly predictable .  i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie .  some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has ,  but birthday girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest .  even without words kidmans acting shines through .
1	i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago ,  after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 .  nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is .  i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly  ( also and amazing show )  .  i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good ,  but there are still some amazing episodes  ( see designate this ,  bag 'em ,  the berrisford agenda ,  harbor lights ,  freak nation etc .  )  and alec is great .  i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3 ,  and i have to say ,  i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked !  i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie  ( although at the moment it seems highly unlikely )  .  as proof of my obsessiveness ,  max's barcode number is 332960073452 ,  and in the two weeks i've had it ,  i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice .  it's just too good .
1	i caught this on the dish last night .  i liked the movie .  i traveled to russia 3 different times  ( adopting our 2 kids )  .  i can't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing  " bad "  turn  " good "  and  " good "  turn  " semi-bad "  .  i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie .  like  " i can't belive this is happening to me "  whether it's good or bad it the same look  ( and it works )  .  great ending .  7/10 .  rent it or catch it on the dish like i did .
1	good ,  funny ,  straightforward story ,  excellent nicole kidman  ( i almost always like the movies she's in )  .  this was a good  " vehicle "  for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both .  a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories ,  great closing lines .  chaplin ,  very good here ,  was also good in another good ,  but unpopular romantic comedy  (  " truth about cats & dogs "  )  .  maybe they're too implausible .  ebert didn't even post a review for this .  the great  " screwball "  comedies obviously were totally implausible  (  " bringing up baby "  ,  etc .  )  .  if you've seen one implausible comedy ,  you've seen them all ?  or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s .  weird .  birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times .  nicole kidman may be the  " killer app "  for home video .
1	this is a great little film ,  that's very unique ,  and creative ,  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances !  .  all the characters are great ,  and the story while bizarre ,  is fascinating and very interesting ,  plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this !  .  it's very hard to describe this movie ,  because it really is quite bizarre ,  it's a comedy/romance ,  one minute then it turns into a thriller the next ,  however it was still very entertaining all the same ,  plus nicole's russian accent was fantastic ,  and extremely convincing .  chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together ,  and i loved vincent cassel's performance !  ,  plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise !  .  the ending was very cute ,  and it's unpredictable throughout !  ,  plus this movie is quite underrated as well !  .  you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed ,  and i thought all the characters were really likable ,  plus the finale is especially good . this is nicole's movie though ,  and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance !  .  this is a great little film ,  that's very unique ,  and creative ,  with some great plot twists and wonderful performances !  ,  i highly recommend this one !  .  the direction is very good !  .  jez butterworth does a very good job here ,  with great camera work ,  solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace !  .  the acting is wonderful !  .  nicole kidman ,  is stunningly gorgeous !  ,  and is amazing as always ,  she is incredibly sexy ,  very likable ,  had one of the coolest accents ,  added a lot of presence ,  had very good chemistry with ben chaplin ,  and had a very mysterious character !  ,  she was amazing .   ( kidman rules !  !  !  !  )  .  ben chaplin is great here ,  he is extremely likable ,  had a cool character ,  had very good chemistry with kidman ,  the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman ,  even though what she did was wrong ,  and i loved how he got revenge in the end !  .  vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain ,  yes he was ott ,  but he was very intense and quite creepy at times ,  this role was perfect for him .  mathieu kassovitz is ok here ,  but didn't have much to do .  rest of the cast are fine .  overall i highly recommend this one !  .  ***1/2 out of 5
1	i've had a lot of experience with women in russia ,  and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like ,  unfortunately .  they are very cunning ,  ruthless ,  and greedy ,  as well as highly unfair .  from the robotic sex ,  the hustling for gifts ,  to the lies and betrayal ,  i've experienced it all in russia .   i know what i'm talking about .  and here are my qualifications :  here are the photojournals of my three trips to russia in search of a bride .  it includes thousands of pics of many hot russian girls i met ,  black comedy ,  scams i was privy to ,  and the story of my mugging and appearance on russian national tv .   http : //www . happierabroad . com/photojournals . htm  it's like reality tv .  you will love it .  i spent a ton of time putting it together .  so check it out .  the russian woman that nicole kidman plays is a lot like the julia and katya in my photojournals .   my 3 bride seeking trips in russia happen to be very exciting and would sell ,  so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in russia ?  however ,  there is one factual impossibility in this film ,  and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport .  it doesn't work that way at all ,  so i don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this .  there isn't a single russian bride introduction website that works this way ,  and i challenge anyone to find one that does .  the fact is ,  you can only order the russian lady's contact info  ( email ,  address ,  phone number ,  etc .  )  from the website .  from there ,  you correspond and then visit her ,  and if you want to bring her to your country ,  you start the immigration process at your ins office ,  and wait months after that .  that's how it works in real life .  you can't just order her to arrive at your airport .  us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen .   wumaster   - i got everything i wanted by going abroad !  you can too !  http : //www . happierabroad . com
1	nicole kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great .  i really liked ben chaplin in the thin red line and he is very good here too .  this is not great cinema but i was most entertained .  given most films these days this is high praise indeed .
1	every time i see nicole i like her more .  i love a movie like this .  a woman you just won't give up on ,  but she keeps breaking your heart .  first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage ,  the kim novak - laurence harvey version .  the beefs about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty ,  it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak russian ,  i'm sure .  funny how people miss the point .  the no-goodnik russian guys were well cast too .  finally ,  i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin ,  as somebody else noted ,  he plays a sap with great dignity ,  and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole .  to think ,  guys get paid for that ,  mind-blowing .
1	modern ,  original ,  romantic story .   very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin .   miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent .  ben chaplin is also good as the shy ,  dull clerk .  for the men  ( and some women )   :  miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic .  i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is .  it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her .  some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense .  although i hoped for a happy ending ,  the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me .    conclusion  :  good movie .    les pays-bas  :  huit points .
1	a small funny film .  it is totally incredible ,  unbelievable ,  impossible .  but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized ,  even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms .  of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet .  you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never ,  ever ,  ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally .  most of their  " businesses "  there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you .  but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive ,  he is absurdly silly .  but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning .  one think is sure too .  security in english airports is not exactly what it should be ,  but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically .  then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage ,  a real plague on modern airports ,  and don't expect to get fair compensation .  or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous .  i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener .  funny ,  isn't it ?  dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine ,  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
1	when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could ,  only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it .  i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control ,  with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment--imho .  thus for instance ,  dogville ,  even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home ,  or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else's attention ,  or other pet causes of kidman's .    here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job .  i don't how or who was able to restrain her ,  but apparently it worked .  the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman .  and consequently ,  what makes a man's most desperate hopes marginally attainable .    of course ,  the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy ,  but his transformation is adequately believable .  it isn't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego .  instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances .   also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human ,  apart from their criminal mission .  her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture .  and while they are his adversaries ,  they are never really his enemy .  in effect ,  they teach him to be compete .   i really marveled at kidman's ability to physically appear russian .  it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian ,  but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it .  maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing .    i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film .  despite my gratuitous digs at ms .  kidman ,  the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime .
1	this is a comedy based on national stereotypes ,  no doubt .  if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are ,  if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions ,  you can have fun with this film .  nicole kidman is at her best ,  sexy ,  moving and funny .  ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole ,  and the rest of the cast does good work as well .  the final is moving ,  and logical - movie logics ,  of course .  worth watching ,  if you accept the rules of the game .
1	the critics didn't like this film .  it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain .  which was a great shame ,  because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first .   nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian .  ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from 'the graduate' ,  and 'birthday girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic  ( despite being a totally different story !  )  .   sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable ,  moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster .   see it with an open mind !
1	from what critics and audiences indicated ,  birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker .  still ,  because i love nicole kidman ,  i decided to rent it last night .  it proved to be quite worthy of watching .  sure ,  it isn't your basic american comedy ,  and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie ,  but that's why i liked it .  it was a change from all the other movies around ,  a breath of fresh air .  sure ,  there were some plot holes ,  but overall it worked .  first off ,  kidman was fabulous again in a very different ,  not very glamorous ,  but still quite sexy role .  she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood .  not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective ,  but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman ,  you would never question her authenticity .  harrison ford should have taken note in  " k-19 .  "  overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz .
1	this film is definitely an odd love story .  though this film may not be much to shout about ,  nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten ,  though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans & hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area .  what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series " heartbeat "  soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick . nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment .  a good one to watch ,  and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character .
1	are you a giraffe ?  .  .  .  ask john to nadia ,  and she ,  sure of responding well ,  responds him :  yes .  in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other ,  and at the same time ,  the questions and doubts in  " birthday girl "  .  a film that i heard a lot of times ,  but i don't dare to see .  .  .  until two hours of write this .    " birthday girl "  is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count ,  at the same time ,  that nicole kidman is one of the best actress  ( besides she is pretty and intelligent )  that i have ever seen .   " birthday girl "  is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet .  the woman that he finds comes from russia .  she seems to be that delicate woman ,  normal ,  not more .  one day ,  in her birthday comes suddenly ,  his cousin and his friend .  the man ,  begin to discover certain things .  since here ,  he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been .   much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot .  much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel .  but  " birthday girl "  is just the opposite .  this movie is full of good surprises ,  good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined .  this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind .   " birthday girl "  have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes ,  but at the same time ,  certain touching nature ,  and makes it so deeper .    " birthday girl "  is sometimes sad ,  sometimes funny ,  sometimes violent ,  but at the end ,  is totally satisfactory .  and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece .   *sorry for the mistakes .  .  . well ,  if there any .
1	the trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice .  and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across ,  the first half of the movie being a light ,  romance comedy and the second have a more serious ,  romantic drama ,  the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be .  this movie was more of a date movie ,  but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be .  kidman ,  being one of my favorites ,  of course i'm biased ,  but this movie proved to be a light ,  sensitive ,  if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better .  three out of four stars .  9/5/02 .
1	this is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching .  the story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between nicole kidman and ben chaplin grabs your attention .  the acting is first class and the characters are represented well .  sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy .  ben chiller's portrayal of the law abiding and shy englishman with porn s . m .  magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs !  as does the look in nicole kidman's eyes when she is offering john his first taste of intimacy in a long time .  .  .  other times the actors and especially nicole kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant .
1	for a film that got little publicity ,  and few people have heard about ,  this was pretty good .  it's another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky  (  " snatch ,  "   " sexy beast ,  "  etc .  )  .  it's not wild like  " snatch "  but it's interesting and it has some rough characters .   it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer .  basically ,  it's about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian  " mail order bride "  who winds up ,  with the aid of two russian male friends ,  providing a couple of big surprises .   ben chapin and nicole kidman co-star ,  and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman's russian cohorts .  this is a different kind of film and well-acted .  kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face .
1	john  ( ben chaplin )  is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from london .  though the internet ,  he contacts a russian agency of brides .  he selects sophia  ( nicole kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy ,  but certainly has a good taste ,  doesn't he ?  )  and when they met each other ,  he realizes that she does not speak english .  the communication between each other is basically limited by sex  ( again ,  imagine ,  what a terrible situation for the guy ,  just have some kinky sex with nicole kidman !  )  .  on her birthday ,  two russian friends of her visit them .  then ,  lots of surprises will happen .  i liked this movie :  first ,  it is almost impossible to be 'labeled' .  is it a black comedy ,  an action ,  a thriller movie ?  i believe all the choices are correct .  nicole kidman is gorgeous as usual ,  and i am very curious about her russian :  is she speaking russian in a correct accent indeed ,  or just faking ?  anyway ,  i found it an enjoyable movie .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " a isca perfeita "   (  " the perfect bait "  )
1	jessica alba's max and valerie rae miller's original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial .  wonderfully politically incorrect .  quality varies greatly from episode to episode ,  but generally the standard is high and when it is not ,  jessica is always worth looking at .  valerie's urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory .
1	this movie really woke me up ,  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber .   this guy john  ( ben chaplin )  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town ,  until the stunningly gorgeous ,  wild ,  girl-to-die-for nadia  ( nicole kidman )  ,  ordered by email from russia ,  enters his life to become his beloved wife ,  by johns plan .  however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language .  although calm and emotionless on the outside ,  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service ,  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process .   what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure ,  giving the viewer a subliminal message  " you would have probably acted likewise "  .   kidman ,  cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing ,   " almost "  only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues ,  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right .  nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles ,  at least from the cultural background .   the pace of the film is fast and captivating ,  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear ,  you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot ,  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out .   my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy .  to sum it up ,  it has an unusual plot ,  great acting ,  and ideas below the surface .  like the idea of the  " rude awakening "  from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine ,  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings  (  " welcome to the machine !  "  )  .  i bet that in the end ,  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all .   thank you ,  writers ,  for the great story ,  and everyone else for this great movie !  please make a sequel !  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever ,  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 . 9999 percent of the potential viewers ,  i am sure of it .
1	i really have to disagree with guy-yardley-rees who  ( should he have watched the entire film )  would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery  ( some of the best ever shot in skye )  and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole .   this is not a big budget film .  rather it is a film that has a strong community feel .   i can't say how much 'standard' films bore me - pushing out the same polished stuff again and again .  seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all .  it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film .   ok ,  so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster .  that's because the actors are seemingly real people .  i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and at times unusually beautiful .   seachd really bears a second viewing ,  since there are many threads that become clearer second time around - that really do feed into the ending .   overall ,  the combination of music and  ( at times )  stunning visuals ,  plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film .  more of these please !
1	lars von triers europa is an extremely good film .  how's that ?  von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story ,  at least he did have with europa .  to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen .  even with all the tricks ,  in my opinion ,  this film is the most complete ,  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list .  i also think it is perhaps the scariest ,  the most gothic and complete film around .  all right there are other good ones too ,  but this one is my favorite .  the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever .
1	i would highly recommend this movie !  and i certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad !  it was with excited anticipation ,  that i have just pre-ordered it online ,  i enjoyed it so much !  it is not out until february/march 2008 ,  but it will be well worth the wait !  but first go and see it in the cinema if you can .  there is nothing quite like the cinema-experience of a cinema-made movie !  insist that your local cinema puts it on !  i went to see 'seachd ,  the inaccessible pinacle' tonight ,  down here in london ,  and was really impressed .  it is a marvel :  a truly beautiful film set in the scottish highlands :  you will laugh ,  you will cry ,  you will be moved in may different ways ,  you will be intrigued ,  and as the story within the stories is revealed ,  you will be amazed at that revelation .   this movie is in scottish gaelic with english subtitles ,  but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the gaelic :  i am just starting ,  and my son does not ,  nor did many people there tonight ,  and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means !  superlatives do not suffice !  the photography is superb - there is no cgi here ,  and the movie is all the better for that- here you have true photography !  the script is so skilfully and subtly written .  the many-layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers .  the music is at times rousing ,  at times haunting ,  but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance .  and the acting ?   .  .  .  it is to behold  .  .  .  and the actors ?  .  .  .  they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film ,  particularly the two main actors ,  'padruig-the-young' and 'padruig-the-elder'  ( a true bard ,  if ever there was !  )  ,  who both carried a very heavy load !  and the direction ?  well watch out richard !  and the producer ,  responsible for raising funding ,  hiring key personnel ,  and arranging for distributors ?  a task well done !  i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad !  and the gaelic community ?  uill ,  without you it could not have happened !  we were told that this movie was made on a low budget ,  but you would not know it ,  and i think it might well be because ,  for what they might have lacked in money ,  they more than made up for with the richness of the heart ,  and the warmth and co-operation of the local scottish gaelic community .   a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making ,  and the sponsoring ,  of 'seachd' - mòran taing !

1	this movie is best described or compare to  " big fish "   ( the movie by tim burton )  .  but it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale .  and of course here it's not the father ,  but his grandfather who tells the stories .   the movie's narrative also moves back and forth  ( so the story outline here at imdb ,  might tell you more than you would like to read ,  before watching the movie )  .  it's funny and engaging enough ,  even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too .  it also surprises you here and there ,  with things you wouldn't expect .  a nice little movie then ,  that deserves your attention ,  especially if you like movies like that !   : o )
1	an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather .  together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders .  although tragic episodes ,  such as the highland clearances ,  feature in the stories ,  there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them .  it's all filmed in skye ,  so there is a double dose of beauty .  the mountain scenery is breathtaking ,  and it's a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken .  i'm english ,  so i had to read the subtitles ,  but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful .  the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words ,  you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history .  the gaelic community ,  especially on skye ,  worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film .  anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic ,  folk history ,  folk music ,  oral culture ,  scotland ,  british history ,  multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .
1	the scots excel at storytelling .  the traditional sort .  many years after the event ,  i can still see in my mind's eye an elderly lady ,  my friend's mother ,  retelling the battle of culloden .  she makes the characters come alive .  her passion is that of an eye-witness .  one to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives .   of course ,  it happened many years before she was born ,  but you wouldn't guess from the way she tells it .  the same story is told in bars the length and breadth of scotland .  as i discussed it with a friend one night in mallaig ,  a local cut in to give his version .  the discussion continued to closing time .   stories passed down like this become part of our being .  who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were children ?  they become our invisible world .  and ,  as we grow older ,  they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir .  fact and fiction blend with aspiration ,  role models .  warning stories .  archetypes .  magic and mystery .    " my name is aonghas ,  like my grandfather and his grandfather before him .  "  our protagonist introduces himself to us .  and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations .  it produces stories within stories .  stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of scotland ,  its rugged mountains shrouded in mists .  the stuff of legend .  yet seach'd is rooted in reality .  this is what gives it its special charm .  it has a rough beauty and authenticity ,  tempered with some of the finest gaelic singing you will ever hear .   aonghas  ( angus )  visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death .  he burns with frustration .  part of him yearns to be in the twenty-first century ,  to hang out in glasgow .  but he is raised on the western shores among a gaelic-speaking community .   yet there is a deeper conflict within him .  he yearns to know the truth .  the truth behind his grandfather's ancient stories .  where does fiction end ?  and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents .   he is pulled to make a last fateful journey ,  to the summit of one of scotland's most inaccessible mountains .  can the truth be told ?  or is it all in stories ?   in this story about stories ,  we revisit bloody battles ,  poisoned lovers ,  the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth .  in doing so ,  we each connect with angus ,  as he lives the story of his own life .   seachd :  the inaccessible pinnacle is probably the most honest ,  unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made .  like angus ,  i got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories .  but ,  also like angus ,  i forgave this once i saw the 'bigger picture . ' forget the box-office pastiche of braveheart and its like .  you might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of the wicker man .  to see a film that is true to scotland ,  this one is probably unique .  if you maybe meditate on it deeply enough ,  you might even re-evaluate the power of storytelling ,  and the age-old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced .
1	teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast .  she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada .  finally someone has the sense to create a show for her .  the supporting case seems quite good too .  i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing .  though ,  i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 .   ( i might be wrong )  but as far as i am aware ,  the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 .  it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well .  too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas .  now i know corner gas is on ctv ,  but the two shows would be great companion pieces .
1	i'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show .  i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own ,  there's lucy ,  bewitched ,  i dream of jeanie  ( the one with barbara feldman )  ,  and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others ,  the women are all supporting roles not the lead .  so for me ,  the jane show is in pretty good company .  one thing i just thought of though .  i've watched several things made in canada ,  and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow !  it's all made at the height of summer ,  lol !  granted it's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think ,  they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that's part of the lifestyle there also .  i mean sctv ,  just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots .  i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor ,  and i like the bald guy and his craziness ,  i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd  ( i think )  another office comedy with a female lead .  not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone ,  thats saying something .  if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch .  7 of 10 .
1	excellent show .  instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it's the same old thing ,  just different  " stars "  ,  this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations .  we have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back ,  of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w .  shame on global for pulling the plug on this one .  i thought this one would be a winner .  let's be realistic about things ,  few canadian shows make it .  everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away .  i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise .  don't get me wrong ,  i enjoy a lot of shows on tv ,  but ,  come on people ,  let's keep the variety .  this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships ,  with unique characters that you don't see on any sitcoms today or in the past .  too bad that global had to say no to this one ,  foolish mistake .
1	spacecamp is my favorite movie .  it is a great story and also inspires others .   the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie .  it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie .   the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up .  i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school ;  i also know a close friend of the late pilot .   i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach .   i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up .  i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers ,  " invisible "  ,  going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result ,  so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities .  i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later ,  strangely enough ,  on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour .
1	definitely needed a little work in season 2 .  such as the virus between max and logan ,  and ames white along with his ancient ,  super cult .  during season two ,  however ,  the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max .  very good drama in season two .  but of course like all tv shows ,  if there's something a little wrong with it ,  the broadcasting company takes it off the air .  i was seriously hoping for a third and final season .  season 2 leaves you hanging ,  unless you read the books by max allan collins ,  then you will know what happens .   dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again .  since jessica alba's carrier sky rocketed after the show .  if that would be the case ,  then there should be a movie to complete it .  just like the show firefly ,  which of course fox canceled as well .
1	spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day .  seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator .  i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe2 who said that i was young and that is true .  holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow  " hide daddy "  .  the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time .  we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms .  i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible .  my daughter julia is 23rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer .  she already said that she doesn't like bullies .  having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys .  julia has been growing up fast .  the time of jfk and qe2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023 .  julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon .  if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority .  president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time .  thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors .  kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg .  wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses .  if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer .  check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also .
1	hurrah !  a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp .  the film starts slowly ,  the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup .  but when the going gets tough - the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds .   the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the  " i'm right and you're all wrong "  instructor .  i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote .
1	i would like to comment the series as a great effort .  the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well ,  especially in season 1 .  season 2 however became more of a freak show ,  and lost da's original charm .  season one story line was more interesting ,  a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x-series .  i was looking forward to new seasons ,  in fact i still am .  i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback .  even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled ,  da can make it big if worked on properly ,  and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge .
1	this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever !   i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish ,  but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit  " like super cool "  with a  " like totally bitchin "  belt and stick on rhinestones on her face .   but anyways ,  the movie is actually one of the few  " family "  movies that holds your interest .  i know that the begining drags ,  particuarly if you know what is going to happen ,  but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film .   i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie ,  in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself ,  but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind .
1	spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love ,  and mom and dad can have fun watching as well .  growing up in the 80's i enjoyed this movie ,  it's plot and all the actors .  i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own ,  they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did .  the plot is fun ,  a group of kids ,  embark on a journey they never expected ,  when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot .  they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in .  once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life .
1	i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too .  some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality .  this film was meant to be a 'fantasy' .  .  .  . a 'what if' fun film .  it was never meant to be 'real' or serious .  it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion .  .  . i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too !  later ,  i shared it with my daughter and she ,  too ,  loved it .  spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun .  all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film .  so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp  ( one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california )  - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown' .  .  . i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality .  oh well .  if you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one ,  i highly recommend it !  enjoy !
1	this is one of those feel good ,  saturday afternoon movies .  it's right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator .  just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up .  and it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson .  not to mention joquin phoenix .   i personally really like movies like this from time to time .  nothing too deep or too scary .  just a nice story line .  and i would have never known mr .  phoenix had i not recently read the credits .  he was just a baby really when he made this movie .   kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too .  she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie .  i agree it's not an oscar caliber movie .  but very much worth watching .  especially if you have kids in the  ,  let's say ,  8 to 11 year old range .  or ones that are interested in the space program .
1	space camp is a pretty decent film .  the plot is predictable ,  but the actors do a good job ,  and the special effects are decent for the time .   this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster ,  and that really put a hamper on how popular it was .   the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular .  .  .  on the big screen ,  that is .  .  .  on a tv .  .  .  it just looks average .  i remember this scene in the theater .  it made you feel like you were really up there .   this would be a good film to see on imax ,  but i'm sure that will never happen .
1	to my surprise i quite enjoyed 'spacecamp' ,  i remember seeing it about 13 years ago ,  and recently i hired it again .  i was quite impressed .  obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp .  however ,  this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it .  but thats what i liked about it- they don't make films like this anymore ,  so it was a refreshing change .  it was interesting to see kelly preston ,  leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles ,  with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot .  absolutely loved the robot named jinx ,  it was very cute ,  but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters .  the film was almost inspirational in its own way ,  and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama  ( i think )  .
1	this is a family film ,  which to some people is an automatic turn off .  it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs ,  gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book .  this film is none of those .  it is cliché ,  it is formula ,  but it is also fun .  it doesn't ask you to think ,  it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality .  it simply does what a good film ought to do ,  which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure .  the cast is good ,  while not excellent .  as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was ,  as usual ,  excellent .  and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable .    it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster ,  which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening ,  but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein .  so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy .
1	the perfect space fantasy film .  a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down ,  but do they ,  sure they do . this would not be a family film if they all died .  then it will all be sad .  you don't want that kate capsaw ,  the leading lady gives a golden globe performance ,  but sadly ,  she nor lea thompson won one .  that sucks so bad . i can't say it enough ,  this film is so great ,  lea thompson- o lord ,  a perfect girl for this film .  this film is the best for sure .    sorry ,  but better than star wars .  star wars is so over- rated and space camp was so under- rated .  it should of been the other way around  excellent 10/10- 0r maybe 11/10 .  iam not good at math
1	a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot .  and the oxygen in ship was running short .  they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks ,  etc ,  etc .   first of all ,  this movie's plot is not possible in real life .  but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in .   it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years .   ( i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000 ,  it was filmed in 1986 )  there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood .   the view was great from outer space .  it does not look unreal .  it is about 2 hours long ,  it runs so fast that you won't even notice .  you know that it is not real ,  but you just get sucked into it until the end .   overall ,  it is a good family movie .
1	unfortunately ,  spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion .  which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should ,  bring it out .  i'm glad they did .  i first watched spacecamp at a drive-in movie .  which really enhanced the viewing a lot .   while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt .  i had never heard of the others in the movie .  so ,  it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting ,  and acting real good !  of course ,  kate capshaw was excellent too .   i especially liked the scenes ,  where those kids were being shown how to act ,  as a team .  the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for .  the actual launch of a spacecraft ,  is of course ,  old news to us .  however ,  this one was different .   all in all ,  this is one of my most treasured films .  escapist maybe ,  but it was fantastic for a space nut like me .  after probably renting it for 30 - 40 times .  i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it .  now ,  if it only comes out on dvd .  i will probably have it forever .  this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me .
1	i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch .    they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team .   another scene is like during their failure at the simulation ,  kevin gets joaquin to clam down .   i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff .   otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff .   the dvd i have watched feels edited for television .
1	i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth ,  this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory ,  right ?   very i liked watching this film when i was the child .  i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really ,  certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense .  who at healthy senses ,  sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit .  i very like reading for the subject ,  american and soviet space programs .  i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows ?
1	watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories  .  i'm 34 now ,  have not seen it since i was 12-14 .  i had almost forgotten about this movie ,  but when i watched it again recently ,  some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye !  that little robot  " jinx "  ( friends for ever !  )  .  it was just like revisiting my childhood .  it was an absolutely amazing experience for me .  i will always cherish this movie for that reason .  i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience ,  not for this particular movie ,  but any movie you have not seen in a long while .  very nostalgic .  .  .   -thanks for reading
1	wow !    this film is the best living testament ,  i think ,  of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc ,  compared to anything shown by the major media outlets .   those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside .  this film shows you what happened on the inside .    it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman ,  waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight .  the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers .  you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene ,  into the lobby of tower one .    in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane ,  and tower two's subsequent fall ,  you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby .  it is a sight you will not soon forget .   heart-rending ,  tear-jerking ,  and very compelling from the first minute to the last ,   " 9/11 "  deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made .   we must never forget .
1	when this first came out 6 months after the tragedy ,  i didn't want to see it .  i didn't want to open old wounds .  i regretted it .  now i have seen the movie .  thank god i did .  it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd .  i salute you .  it offered me closure .  i can now move on with my life .
1	these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive .  this is definitely a movie about survival ,  but not without it's touching moments .   the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of new york city .
1	if i didn't know any better ,  it almost seems like it was staged ,  but it wasn't .  it was set up perfectly ,  and how they got all of that footage is amazing !  the unfortunate events of september 11 ,  2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic .  just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11 .
1	spoilers 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc . 2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it . before 9/11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario .  on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change . as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane , this is the only footage of the first impact . he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building . as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident . in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible , in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds , these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground , this is the most grueling moment in the documentary . then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life , you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building . then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black , he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york .  because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody's memory . i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of , so this makes it even more realistic to watch .  10/10
1	amazing documentary .  saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years .  i was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a best documentary oscar for 2002 ,  the year it was released .  no other documentary even comes close .   it was on tv recently for the 5th anniversary ,  but i missed the added  " where are they now "  segment at the end ,  except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit .   i've seen criticism on documentary film-making from a few on this list .  i can't see how this could have been done any different .  they had less than 6 months to assemble this and get it on the air .  the dvd contains more material and background .   i'm also surprised that according to imdb . com ,  the brother have had no projects in the four years since .  what have they been doing ?
1	it took us a couple of episodes to  " get into "  dark angel as a story and a series ,  since we were transitioning from the sopranos ,  a very different mentality framework .  but ,  once we got with the gist of the series ,  we were very quickly hooked .  it's a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category :  dark angelwas much more than your average tv series .  it kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes ,  but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to  " mutants "  reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face  ( and make )  everyday .  that the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being rubbed in our faces  ( hence not ruining the  " fun "  for those who don't like to be lectured during entertainment )  ,  but every event and human/societal interaction remains relevant to the present .  we all make judgments ,  face our own prejudices ,  but ,  in the end ,  the question of who you are lies in :  do you sit back and shut your mind to it ,  or do you get up and do something about it ?  for those who have no choice but to fight ,  for survival or justice ,  this series empowers them .  for those who've never had to face the question ,  this series  " sneaks in "  that message under the guise of pure action entertainment .  it is much more well-made and well-written than most tv series ;  i'm highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear .
1	made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet ,  and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york's finest shone on it's darkest day .  i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old ,  and at that age it still touched me .  knowing how serious 9/11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9/11 .  we were finding out who the heroes were ,  how there everyday lives were composed ,  and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves .  these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them .  watch if you can , this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen .
1	dark angel rocks !  the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off !  me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode !  takes like 4 days but it is worth it !  it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me !
1	the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did ,  they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened .  they were in building #2 ,  when you could see papers drifting down ,  people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height .   i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running ,  their camera was still running ,  when the white dust covered them ,  they found a shop doorway and got inside ,  but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us .   ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9/11 so i'll never forget what this country went through .  i believe if i remember right ,  it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters ,  while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral .
1	difficult film to comment on ,  how do you say it's bad ?  well it isn't ,  but then it's equally difficult to say it is good .  what it is ,  is compelling viewing ,  it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there .  it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life ,  you know you want to turn away but you have to watch .   the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well ,  even in the most tragic of circumstances ,  there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults .  the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on .   you can't change history ,  and you should not want ,  this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour .
1	i've read most of the comments here .  i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history .  there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and   i agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary .  about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about tony .  but i don't think narration is unnecessary .  like i lot of theorists i think that our own lives are narrations .  we are living and making our own autobiography .  so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration .  we don't sum up facts like :  birth ,  childhood ,  high school etc .  we create a story about our live .   because we are familiar with stories ,  we want to put history in a story as well .  because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves .  we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story .  so that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary .  the story is weak ,  so be it ,  but we understand whats going on .  if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother .   and the second point ,  making a blockbuster movie about it .  true ,  it's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9/11 .  though ,  there have been a few about the subject ,  but none of them like this documentary .  but what if there will be a movie in about 5 years ?  i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9/11 .  but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history .  how many movies about the world war 2 have we seen ?  if i had not seen these movies my view of the ww would me totally different .  i remember seeing schindlers list ,  and i cried for an hour during class .  movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties .    so my point :  telling stories is not always bad ,  it makes us identify with the story ,  and makes us never forget what happened .
1	the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers .  in my view it would have been better to leave this out .  i think the directors tried too hard ,  perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop .  the comment of one of a policemen -  " this aint f***ing disneyworld "  is apt .   nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events .  the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times ,  no other footage from the day matches what they shot .
1	let me get the bad out of the way first ,  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day .  really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes .  i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september 11th .  it is a second home to me and i can't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city .  this is the real deal ,  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them .  i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day .  it is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory ,  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .
1	i live in missouri ,  so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me ,  this brought it home .  that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did ,  just to document the horror that unfolded on that day .  this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings .
1	gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters .  what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11 .   having worked with james hanlon's ladder company before ,  jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak ,  while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened .  an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules ,  and he pointed the camera up ,  seconds before the plane crashed into tower one .   jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers .  the first thing he saw was two people on fire ,  something he refused to film .  he stayed on site for the next several hours ,  filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there .   the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent ,  grizzly ,  and gory .  but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse ,  and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored .  the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis .    unlike a feature film of similar title ,  most of the money from dvd sales go to 9/11-related charities .  very well made ,  emotional ,  moving ,  and completely devoid of political propaganda ,  is the best documentary of the sort to date .
1	i have to say that the events of 9/11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary .  it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation .  i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers .  i was sick of hearing about it .  when this was aired on tv a year and a day later ,  i was bawling my eyes out .  it was the first time i had cried since the attack .  i highly recommend this documentary .  i am watching it now on tv ,  5 years later ,  and i am still crying over the tragedies .  the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing .  it was an accident ,  and look where it got them .  these two brothers make me want to have been there to help .
1	i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9/11 .  he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding .  i liked the way it was told as a  " documentary .  "  if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning 9/11 ,  this would be the one !  normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known .  this movie had nobody known .  also ,  you see a movie concerning 9/11 ,  you hear about a fire-fighter or two losing their lives saving people .  i didn't feel this had any of that !  i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection !  very well done indeed !  my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9/11 !
1	incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th .  intense ,  personal ,  and completely riveting ,  9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident ,  which kind of gives it an even greater appeal .  up until that morning ,  filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team ,  concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman .  out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup ,  jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center ,  and from there a simple documentary was no more .   viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero ,  as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster .  without hesitation ,  naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them .  the raw fear of an unknown ,  impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside .  nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed .  by the time we get to see the second tower collapse ,  as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris ,  we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured .   obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event ,  though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event ;  in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage ,  even if it cost them their own safety .   after viewing 9/11 ,  and seeing that it came out in 2002 ,  i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition ,  the big budgeted world trade center .  many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble ,  and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought ,  9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete .  not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day ,  but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again .
1	i miss dark angel !  .  .   i understand not ever one likes it ,  but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled ,  especially for another space show mock up .  .  .   i'm reading the books now .  they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings ,  but i still think we should get a tv movie or something .   the freak nation lives !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !
1	to sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible .  every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images ,  through to the last shot of the clean up at ground zero ,  but every frame is real .  the story was thought up by two french brothers living in new york .  jules  ( 28 )  and gideon  ( 31 )  naudet  ( pronounced  " nau-day "  )  want to make a documentary on new york city firefighters ,  beginning with a  " newbie "  from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter .  seeking the help of their close friend ,  actor james hanlon  ( 36 )  ,  an actor and firefighter at station 1 ,  engine 7 ,  the naudets sift through the  " probies "  at the academy and find one ,  tony benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on .   tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family .  firefighters have a superstition about  " probies .  "  it is that they are either  " white clouds "  or  " black clouds ,  "  meaning that with the latter ,  all kinds of fires follow the  " probie .  "  the former means that very little fire activity follows ,  but one day ,  there will be the mother of all fires .  tony is a  " white cloud .  "  after some initial growing pains ,  tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet .  then the unthinkable occurs .  .  .  .   september 11 ,  2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street .  because jules has had little camera experience ,  gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief ,  t .  k .  pfeiffer .  arriving at about 8 : 42 ,  the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate .  then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene ,  and as jules pans upwards ,  we see the first strike of the day .  american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade .  pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center .  once there ,  jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower .  pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him .  once inside ,  the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives .    gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area .  once there ,  he captures the impact of the second plane ,  united airlines flight 175 ,  with 2 world trade .  he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers .  watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable ,  gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan .  inside tower one ,  jules records the last view the world ,  or loved ones will have of their sons ,  fathers ,  uncles ,  grandfathers ,  husbands ,  boyfriends ,  friends as one by one ,  each firefighter ,  carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped .  jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother ,  kevin ,  as he leaves to do his selfless duty .  also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones ,  sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke .  but jules is respectful ,  never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment .  .  . the money shot .  his work is professional through his baptism of fire .  he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building .  then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken :  father michael judd ,  the chaplain for the fire department .  then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two ,  tower one begins its structural collapse .    what results is a breathtakingly ,  poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day .  not knowing if either is alive ,  each fearing the worst .  as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse ,  they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back .  and in one moment of overwhelming emotion ,  jules and gideon are reunited .  as jules cries on his brother's shoulder ,  gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject .  there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos ,  who left the station with a former chief ,  is believed to have been lost .  .  . but returns to the fold ,  this  " probie "  has proven himself .   shown with only three interruptions ,  9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking .  it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds .  the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject .  in lesser hands ,  the tendency would be toward the sensational ,  but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion .  narrated by hanlon ,  we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 .  robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre ,  restrained way .  he never seeks the camera for his own glory ,  rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see .  i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special .  chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings ,  they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished .  this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is .  it isn't about dribbling a basketball ,  or selling an album of hate lyrics .  .  . 9/11 is about humanity at its best .  heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .
1	this was the most visually stunning ,  moving ,  amazing and incredible story i've ever experienced .  quite frankly ,  even those adjectives just cannot describe it .  i can't just choose one scene that stood out for me .  i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims ;  the reaction of people trapped in the elevator ,  who were unaware of what was going on ,  as they finally emerge to the horrific scene ;  the shock and disbelief of the onlookers ;  and finally the silence .    on that day ,  and even now ,  i am reminded of star wars  ( 1977 )  .  obi-wan says ,  `i felt a great disturbance in the force ,  as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced . ' it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description .  there was truly a disturbance in the force .   this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance .  the feelings are so incredibly visual .  the anger ,  the frustration ,  the shock ,  the fear ,  the exhaustion ,  and the realization of its very magnitude .  it's all there .  not a thing is missed .   this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy .  not just because it documents 9/11 but because it is simply everything it should be .    if you plan to watch ,  be sure to grab a box of tissues .  you'll need them .  i know that i did .
1	to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed ,  i disagree .  this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day .   imdb asks us to rate this movie .  i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made .  the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable .  we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened .  they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety .  to judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing ,  amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer .  i just know that in 30 years ,  a class full of children will not know one without the other .   i submit a wholehearted 10 .  this is why the art of filming was created !  to capture the natural emotion that real life offers .  you can keep your kung-fu junk .  romance is cute .  action will never reach this level .  this movie ,  9/11 ,  will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself .  it didn't have a sneak-peek .  it didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare .  it had class ,  composure ,  substance ,  and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world .  it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera .  please consider this movie ,  as it itself proclaims ,  a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free ,  beautiful name of america .   how can you give anything less to a movie that shows ,  not embellishes ,  the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times .  i love  " the godfather "  but  " 9/11 "  is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world .  it is art without question or questions .   jf
1	i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs .  i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day ,  i was going to school at hunter college .  i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again ,  but like many i was curious to see what this was all about .  tears came to my eyes watching this documentary .  all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable .  i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times .  how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible .  if you have not seen this documentary ,  do yourself a favor and check it out .  it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes ,  but it's an incredible document of this countries darkest hour .
1	great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time .  .  that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item .  .  what shocked me was not only the attacks ,  but the " high fat diet "  and physical appearance of some of these firefighters .  i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that , in the physical shape they were in ,  some of these firefighters would not of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear .  having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job .  the french have a history of making great documentary's and that is what this is ,  a great documentary .  .  .  .  .
1	very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on 11th september 2001 . the main theme of it is the heroism of american fire-fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could . the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing-many people seen on screen have lost their lives ! recommended .
1	**warning !  mild spoilers ahead ! **   ( yes ,  i realize it's tough to spoil an historical documentary ,  but i do reveal some of the backstory and methods .  )   this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage ,  but also due to the story behind it .  because the naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9/11 ,  but rather that of a rookie firefighter ,  the men's emotions and the viewer's connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective .    in a filmmaking sense ,   " 9/11 "  is textbook .  if the events were an actual script ,  they would be superb ,  as the characters are established ,  then thrown a curve to which they must react .  this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together .    the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station ;  specifically ,  how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans .  that part alone is quite good ,  and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course ,  it probably would have been solid .  the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc firefighter .    then of course ,  all hell breaks loose .  the chaos following the wtc attacks is vividly seen ,  as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations .  seeing not only the attacks ,  but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion .    the aftermath ,  in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found ,  is human drama at its peak .  life and death hang in the balance .  unlike many movies ,  the viewer not only doesn't know who will live and die ,  but genuinely cares about them .    the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro  ( whom i like )  blurbs were uninformative ,  unnecessary ,  and didn't advance the story at all .  they were probably added just to attract more television viewers .   bottom line :  the best documentary i've ever seen .  nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama .  9 . 5 out of 10 .
1	9/11 is a classic example of cinema verite ,  a sort of realist documentary ,  in this case of new york firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history .  it's all tiny ,  unobtrusive ,  hand-held video cameras ,  often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming  ( and by the director ,  naudet's hand frequently wiping the screen )  .   in this film ,  you get to know most of the firemen - tony benatatos ,  the rookie  ( or 'probie' ,  in ny fireman vernacular )  ,  the fire chief joseph pfeiffer  ( who finds he's lost his brother later on )  and a few others .  there are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film ,  just to emphasise the personal ,  reflexive nature of the events .  the build-up is quite dramatic and well-done ,  particularly the passing-out ceremony at the fire department ,  with a few useful swish-pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork  ( just like rob reiner's a few good men )  .  tony looks proud .   the viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen ,  which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of wtc1 while pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - this is classic cinema verite .  there is also the eery ,  haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside .  it is then that an increasingly forlorn fire chief pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and this is before wtc2 collapses .  you have to give credit to naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment .   the sound of the neighbouring wtc2 collapsing is so awfully sad ,  poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen .  from the lobby ,  it looks ,  feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened .  you hear an enormous rumbling ,  trembling maelstrom - like that of a giant ,  monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded - the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in wtc1 are oblivious to this event .  where is the communication ?   this film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided - cues like 'this really was a day like no other' or naudet's frequently banal pronouncements like 'you could see fear in everybody's eyes' and 'i knew tony was freaking out' !  the film is really just one long video diary .  there are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone .  imagine this film blended with cctv footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day .  the effect would be greater .  you could even combine this story with that of mayor giuliani and ,  perhaps ,  the famous cornishman rick riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero .   i don't see much of a propaganda element in this film ,  as some reviewers suggest .  this film is no triumph of the will ,  by riefenstahl .  some time later the firemen drape the american flag over a nearby ,  surviving building overlooking what has become ground zero .  so what ?   there are also some moments of dubious camerawork ;  for example ,  who is holding the camera when the two naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station ?  is it staged ?   there is an excellent finish ,  very much in the traditon of the excellent french director alain resnais  ( hiroshima mon amour )  ,  with two strips of light reflected in the water ,  shimmying .
1	it's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes .  and none more so that september 11 ,  2001 ,  a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism .   no ,  this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11 .  rather ,  the filmmakers ,  brothers gédéon and jules naudet ,  set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter .  they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training ,  and had handpicked their  " proby "   ( probation firefighter )  to join them in an ny firehouse ,  home to ladder 1 and engine 7 .  but their production was to develop and contain at that time ,  believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center .   i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming ,  and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad ,  who informed me of the above .  few minutes later ,  he told me there was another ,  and that the wtc was under attack .  by the time i arrived home ,  the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke ,  and to my horror ,  they collapsed ,  under an hour .   the filmmakers had two cameras running that day ,  one who had followed a team out on a routine call ,  and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it .  we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters ,  paramedics ,  and police had to make sense of what happened ,  and to quickly develop a plan of action .  the other camera ,  held by the other brother ,  was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling ,  and along the journey ,  captured the many expressions of new yorkers ,  as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten .   peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 ,  which miraculously ,  did not suffer any casualty .  but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil ,  as they struggle to come to terms with the event .  through the events that unfold ,  we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs ,  to save lives .   we began with what the documentary was supposed to be ,  before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus ,  right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures .  it's not a film that is fabricated ,  and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary  ( and heavens ,  not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters )  .  it's as close as you can get to that day ,  witnessing the event up close ,  from safety .   code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7 .
1	" 9/11 ,  "  hosted by robert deniro ,  presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york ,  on september 11 ,  2001 .   never too grisly and gory ,  yet powerful and moving .   " 9/11 "  is a real treat .  anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything .   5/5 stars --
1	my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her .  she's from china and only heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary .  i felt awful watching this documentary ,  it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes .   but i'm extremely grateful that i watched this documentary ,  because on the day of september 11th ,  i'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard ,  all of us could only think certain questions :   " why ?  "  ,   " how ?  "  ,   " what's going on ?  "  ,   " oh ,  my god !  "  .  almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others .  but i don't think we thought about what they were really going though .  this wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about 9/11 ,  the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything ,  outside and in ,  on tape .   on sep .  11th ,  i thought to myself  " it's ok ,  the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived "  .  to be honest ,  i thought it was an accident ,  i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class .  someone came into the locker room shouting  " some building just got bombed in new york !  "  ,  we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv .  not only 15 seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident .  a few minutes later ,  we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down .  so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking  " what are the firemen and policemen going to do ?  "  .  but it's procedure to them i thought ,  they'll know what to do .   the first tower collapsed ,  we knew it ,  so many lives are now gone ,  the second tower crashed ,  things would never be the same .  those firemen in this documentary showed courage ,  confusion ,  and strength ,  the real raw human emotions .  they didn't know what to do ,  they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers .  they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows .  and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv .  i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help .  i know they feel like they were just doing their job ,  but they did more ,  they were hero's .  every day after sep .  11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors ,  but they kept on hoping and praying .  may god bless their kind and brave hearts .   as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks .  she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day .  she asked  " why ?  "  .  i didn't know what to say ,  it breaks my heart that people can be that evil .   " it sounds clique' ,  but it was a normal day for everyone "  one of the firemen said in the documentary .  no one expected this to happen .  not like that ,  those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked ,  they were just doing their job ,  happen to be there ,  or even just was there for a second passing by .  they were not just murdered ,  they were slaughtered ,  and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart .  then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating ,  why do people do this ?  they celebrated death and the lose of :  mothers ,  fathers ,  sisters ,  brothers ,  friends ,  grandparents ,  aunts ,  uncles ,  cousins ,  etc .  why ?    so ,  thanks to those people for making this documentary .  you truly think about the firemen ,  policemen ,  and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world .  thank you to all those people ,  you are our heroes .   10/10
1	i was one of many that expected to see a glorified ,  yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that  ( as famously quoted )  should live in infamy ,  rather than glory .  how wrong i was .  these guys were there ,  right in the middle of it ,  and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking .  and yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on september 11 ,  2001 .   two french filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a ny firefighter ,  particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks .  at the beginning we see much of this footage ,  just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism .  this was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others ,  and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge .   while investigating a suspect gas line  ( i think ,  my memory's a little hazy on that )  ,  we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead .  the camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers .  what must the cameraman have been thinking at this time ?  recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on ,  and possibly realizing the same thing ,  the fdny allow the camera to follow them into the building .   what follows is a true view from the front-lines .  we see the commitment of the fdny ,  their reactions  ( the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling )  as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside ,  while a second camera captures the events from the outside .   if it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering ,  the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true .  quite simply ,  the footage deserves to be preserved for all time .  but what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer .  we see firefighters charging in without hesitation ,  people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another  ( they are brothers )  as they cannot reach one another in the confusion .  there are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film ,  something hollywood could never duplicate  ( even though it's trying )  .   9/11 isn't a film about politics .  nor is it a film about religion ,  nationality or even jihad for that matter .  9/11 is a film about people ,  and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of .  9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films i've ever seen ,  and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me .  you can't duplicate this .
1	i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary .  i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much .  i was wrong .  this is not propaganda ,  in fact it is hardly political at all .   it depicts the events of 9/11 through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed .  it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all !  this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming  " a man "  .  we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them .   a great piece of work .  absolutely stunning material .  highly recommended .   regards ,
1	it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr .  the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome !  the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls .
1	yowsa !  if you really want some action ,  check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller !  veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism .  .  .  but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy-swimsuit scenes ,  jiggly beach jogs ,  hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like !  want action ?  you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor .  want babes ?  you'll get an eyeful every two minutes .  want more ?  go out and buy this video !  yowsa ,  yowsa ,  yowsa !  that's some mighty spicy meatballs !  !  !
1	a thin story with many fine shots .  eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d . r . e . a . m .  team .  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  the guy accompanying them .  traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business-couple intending to poison the world with antrax .  original in this movie is the bra-bomb ,  put on a captured member of the d . r . e . a . m . -team .  of course she is rescued by a co-member ,  three seconds before explosion .  although clearly lent from james bond's 'goldfinger' and 'you only live twice' ,  such a climax always works well .  all in all a nice watch ,  james bond replaced here by three charlie's angels .
1	of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime .  rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy .  he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing .  so rodolfo sonego did .  if you check out his biography ,  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy .  alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories .  my uncle visited australia and my town ,  in 1968 to check out locations for  " a girl in australia "  and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war .  you can see his humor in all his movies .  i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently .  great
1	i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title ,  until one day i was scrolling through john candy's film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named  " once upon a crime .  .  .  "  .  something rang a bell and i clicked on it ,  and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories .   i've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a  " great "  comedy .  it is ,  however ,  rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills .   the movie has a large cast of characters ,  amongst them an american couple who find a woman's dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival .  from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers .   kind of a mix between  " it's a mad mad mad mad world "  and a lighter hitchcock feature ,  this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as john candy - to star in it .  the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast ,  and the ending has a funny little twist that isn't totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected .
1	super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast ,  an outstanding script ,  and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's .  at the time ,  rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens .  but whatever the value of those shadowy downers ,  they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era .  few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy .   jim blandings  ( cary grant )  works as an ad-man on madison ave .  where in his little daughter's words-- he sells things to people that they don't need ,  at prices they can't afford .  he's making good money ,  but like thousands of others ,  he's tired of living in a cramped urban  " cave "  .  so ,  with wife myrnah loy ,  they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside .  needless to say ,  in the arms of nature ,  they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion .   there's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script .  i don't know if writers panama and frank got an oscar ,  but they should have .  of course ,  the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land .  the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage ,  with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time .  of course ,  no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant ,  so it's just one well-placed laugh after another ,  particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own .  yet ,  oddly ,  the film appears to have no comedic high-point .  instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point .  that's a real movie triumph for any era .   reaching back 60 years later ,  we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind .  with their live-in maid ,  the blandings may not be a typical american family ,  but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical .  and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an  " ad-man "  tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more  " ham "  .  more than anything ,  however ,  there's the movie's sunny optimism .  oh sure ,  the feeling falters at times ,  yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through .  indeed ,  life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge ,  so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day .  it's that easily over-looked subtext ,  along with the sheer entertainment value ,  that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period .   so ,  if you haven't seen it ,  catch it next time around .
1	i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie .  i thought everyone was very good .  i was not familiar with richard lewis ,  i thought he made his character  ( julian peters )  very personable ,  funny and attractive .  sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold .  george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo .  john candy has a field day as the bon vivant .  james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk .  cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife .  delightful ensemble cast .  lots of talent ,  clever script ,  lots going on and beautiful locations .  just a nice pick me up for a dreary day .  especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon .
1	with a well thought out cast ,  this movie was a great comedic relief .  the plot is well-written and the cast was knockout .  every bit as good as the reviews suggested  ( a rarity )  and was highly entertaining .  being a huge john candy fan myself ,  this movie was no disappointment .
1	this movie has an all star cast ,  john candy ,  richard lewis ,  ornella mutti ,  cybill shepard ,  and jim belushi to name a few ,  run amuck in monte carlo ,  as well as some other beautiful european locations ,  and is very funny .  the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great ,  and i highly recommend that you see this movie ,  it is well worth it !  john candy is in top form in once upon a crime ,  as is everyone else !  if you and your family are looking for a great family film ,  this is your ticket .  everyone gives stellar performances ,  great acting ,  great comedy ,  and great timing ,  which is rare in movies these days .  great plot ,  great mystery ,   ( which i love anyways )  and overall ,  well worth the money you spend on it .  so get the kids ,  grab some popcorn ,  juice ,  or tea ,  or sodas ,  and enjoy the show !  !  !  !
1	john candy's performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever .  it's been my favourite movie since it came out .  i spent 5 years searching for it .  that's how good it is .  if you disagree ,  well ,  that's your opinion .  enjoy the movie .
1	i would reccomend this film to everyone .  not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue ,  but to all film-buffs .  because it's sincere ,  moving ,  funny and true .  because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover ,  and every frame of his film is made with love and care .  because his characters are loved and ask to be loved .  because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one ,  done by an outsider ,  is a real joy to watch and to listen at .  because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza ,  who was ,  like freccia ,  beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin ,  that ligabue shows as it is ,  unglamorous and ugly ,  without indulging in easy moralisms .  because it's a film that speaks to our heart ,  our ears ,  our souls .  and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that .  thanks ,  luciano !
1	.  .  . about the importance of being young ,  having friends ,  and most of all enjoying life .  through the experience of four friends ,  ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the 70's in a small italian village .  the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior ;  also the drug experience is well represented .
1	nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70's and 80's .  radiofreccia describes a generation ,  it describes life in a small village near correggio  ( hometown of ligabue ,  the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie )  ,  it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world .  it reminds of trainspotting ,  with a bit of italian touch .
1	" radiofreccia "  is still a good surprise in italian cinema .  the film is based on a book of italian songwriter luciano ligabue ,  who also directs the movie and writes the music score -of course .   the film is a portrait of north italian province life ,  in the emilia romagna region .  we're in 1975 ,  the time of the first free radios -one of the boys of the movie creates  " radioraptus "  .  youth wishes ,  friendship ,  love ,  sex ,  individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes ,  but the film speaks also about drugs -freccia ,  the main character ,  is a victim of heroin slavery .   without being boring and moralist ,  the story flows very well ;  the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well .  obviously luciano  " liga "  ligabue is neither fellini nor a movie professional ,  first of all he's a musician .  but he succeeds in making a good product .  unfortunately he'll not repeat the success with his second movie  " da zero a dieci "  -not good at all .   in  " radiofreccia "  actors are generally not very famous ,  the only star is stefano accorsi -one of the most popular young italian actors .  see in a small role another italian songwriter -francesco guccini ,  he's the nice communist barman and football trainer !
1	radiofreccia is a movie about all of us ,  about our dreams ,  our friends ,  our obsessions ,  our addictions ,  our fears .  it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century .  the movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things ,  it just tells us a story ,  one that all of us could have experienced .  one of happiness and excitement ,  sadness and grief .  the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters ,  it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again ,  feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place .  hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends ,  listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international ,  playing their dreams ,  our dreams .  radiofreccia will make you laugh ,  it will make you cry at times ,  it will shock you and comfort you ,  it will give you and take from you .  personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life ,  and that of my friends ,  and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours .
1	now this show looks like most of the other shows of it's type from the mid-90's ,  but the only thing is about this one is that it's different ,  they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too .  i personally thought it was a good show ,  i can't understand why would they cancel it .  the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date .   my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie ,  which i know is gonna be impossible to do ,  but hey it doesn't hurt to dream ,  doesn't it ?   anyway ,  i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes ,  because the characters are great ,  the story lines are good ,  the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great .
1	this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes ,  the money pit and are we done yet ?  ,  only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since ,  regretfully ,  been lost .   i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age ,  there was much i could laugh at .  now of course being familiar with adult frustrations ,  i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth .   the three main actors .  .  . cary grant ,  myrna loy ,  and melvyn douglas .  .  . interacted perfectly ,  but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream .  it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions .   all in all ,  this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it .
1	a classic cartoon ,  always enjoyable and funny .  it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters .  road rovers is a show worth seeing ,  it is a short 13 episodes ,  and if you can ever manage a chance to see it ,  you should .  unfortunately ,  it is very hard to find .  i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all 13 episodes .  i would definitely buy it if they did ,  and if they do ,  you should buy it too .  if you have kids who like dogs ,  they will love road rovers !  road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired ,  it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was .
1	far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did ,  after animaniacs .  even if the ratings were low ,  so what ,  i still enjoyed it and loved it ,  was so funny and i adored the cast ,  wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic ,  the whole cast were brilliant ,  especially the legendary frank welker .   i'd love to see this cartoon again ,  was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant .  also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it ,  you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental ,  that was just fantastic ,  i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in .  i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back ,  i loved them
1	the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world .  the show was hilarious to say the least .  simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages .  running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game .  the action was mesmerizing ,  and cleverly set up .  the characters were very original ,  each with a very different personality .  but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters .  each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed ,  but implied in subtext .  hopefully ,  one day ,  there'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .
1	michael stearns plays mike ,  a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality .  he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it .  he believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of  " innocence "  and/or  " beauty "  .  so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ,  ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope .   the seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again .  the  " story "  comes off as more of an afterthought .  this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity  ( the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes )  and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation .  of course ,  seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism .   ( for one thing ,  mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger .  )  this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack .   those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another .  it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react .  it unfolds at a very slow pace ,  but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist .  it's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen .   7/10
1	i enjoyed this movie .  haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly .  i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile .   i wasn't troubled that dotty's  " anxiety disorder "  may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook .  there are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses ,  and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms .  she is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos .  it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric .   although this is taken to be a light  " family movie "  ,  it is actually more sophisticated than it seems .  also ,  hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle .  it's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .
1	though not in the whole film ,  andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv-movie .  the plot is easy-griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named  ( mountains somewhere )  .  though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video ,  if you do get the chance to watch this--take it .
1	i saw that when i was little and it was excellent .  kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute .  susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius .  karen boettcher-tate as profster was interesting .  burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny .  gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant .  whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy .  whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon .  this story is about when lisa ,  snoodle ,  doodle go to the big rock candy mountains .  this show is excellent the kids will like this show ,  new words ,  songs ,  and watching them playing .
1	me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so  ( but they let us anyways )  and i love it .  .  . i can't find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking about .  .  . i'm glad to see that i'm not the only one that loved this movie .  .  . i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere !  !  i would love to watch this now just bc i loved it so much as a little kid .  .  . and i'm 15 now !  !  !  i remember so much about it .  .  . thats where i got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie !  !  i think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
1	so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it .  we would watch it all the time .  when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa's magical toys .  i'm 21 now and i still love this movie ,  some old friends and i recently got together and watched it ,  we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little .  one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie .  this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe ,  no violence ,  no bad language ,  just lots of great songs and important lessons .
1	big rock candy mountain is amazing .  i watched it when i was little ,  and still do to this day .  ( senior in high school )  .  if i could imagine heaven ,  that is what it would look like .  i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees .  zach hyman is profs ,  and my best friend .  little bunny foo foo is the man .  it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night .  in fact ,  my friend who is 18 recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it .  i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie .  i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie .  we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle .  i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit .  thanks .  bye .
1	coinciding with the start of the baby boom ,  the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes .  directed by h . c .  potter and co-written by norman panama and melvin frank  (  " white christmas "  )  ,  this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well .  of course ,  it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  cary grant ,  myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership .  even though the film is sixty years old now ,  there is a timeless quality to the blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it .  obviously ,  hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical tom hanks comedy ,  1986's  " the money pit "  ,  and again last year with ice cube's  " are we done yet ?  "  .  one look at hgtv's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today .   the plot begins with ad man jim blandings ,  his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath manhattan apartment .  rather than pursue muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7 , 000 ,  jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move .  with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole ,  the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair .  however ,  the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one .  this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first .  costs rise with each new complication ,  tempers flare ,  and even a romantic triangle is imagined among ,  jim ,  muriel and bill .  priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners .   with his double takes and flawless line delivery ,  grant is infallible in this type of farce ,  and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters .  in a role originally meant for irene dunne ,  myrna loy shows why she was hollywood's perfect wife .  she doesn't get many of the funnier lines ,  but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own .  watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette .  as avuncular ,  pipe-smoking bill  (  " colebill cole "  )  ,  melvyn douglas shows his natural ,  easy-going élan as grant's foil .  smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well-digger mr .  tesander ,  lurene tuttle as jim's officious assistant mary ,  and louise beavers as the blandings' lovable maid gussie .  the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then-wife ,  actress betsy drake .  a most appropriate 1949 cartoon ,   " the house of tomorrow "  ,  is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house .  the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant's film classics complete the extras .
1	when i was little ,  my parents got this movie for me to watch .  i really liked it ,  and i watched it over and over again .  even when i was in 3rd grade i still watched it from time to time .  recently ,  i watched it again ,  just for the sake of nostalgia ,  and though the show was not aimed for my age group  ( i'm in my late teens )  ,  i still found it entertaining and educational .  this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others .  some parts i found quite entertaining .  also ,  this show does not have any bad content ,  so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot .  i would recommend this .
1	this incredibly formulaic flick from the  " walker ,  texas ranger "  squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie .  in addition ,  one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go .  however ,  it's a fun little movie that gets the job done :  it entertains .  that's all it was meant to do and it does so .  the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad .  the acting is also decent ,  which isn't much of a surprise ,  because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal .  if you're a fan of the genre  ( and of  " walker ,  texas ranger "  )  ,  you will definitely love this .  if not ,  then don't waste your time .  8/10
1	a true hero of modern times  ,  chuck norris has left tv  " walker  ,  rexas ranger  "  ,  and is looking new steps for his artistic career .  the president´s man is the second movie of a future tv series  ,  with norris in the title role ,  and with young actors like jennifer tung or judson mills  (  one of the young rangers of  " walker  "   )   .  the old master teachs to young aspirant  .  it´s one of the most powerful themes of  " the president´s man  "  .  in this tima ,   " a line in the sand  "  has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in usa  ,  months before the tragic september 11 .  eric norris ,  son of chuck is the director  .  the movie is amusing ,  a good action work  ,  plenty of fights and heroism  .  chuck norris have many plans for the future  .  bells of innocence  ,  his next picture ,  will be the following .
1	good show ,  very entertaining .  good marshal arts acting .  good story plot .  the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich ,  to chuck ,  norris ,  jennifer tung ,  and especially a big hand to judson mills .  an especially fine tribute to robert urich ,  in his latter days .  a great  !  actor who will be truly missed .
1	there are a few spoilers in this comment !  !   contrary to the comments i just read by nativetex4u and a few others ,  i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series .   i am a judson mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little ,  the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired .   the opening fifteen minutes with deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed .  i do fail to see how that many  " professionals "  weren't able to hit a moving target ,  but the action was definitely there and deke ,  being the hero ,  had to survive .   as for the comment about needing to  " get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs .  "  this movie was not originally scheduled by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001 ,  a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u . s .   if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it ,  maybe they would have realized the plot of the story :  rashid ,  a bin laden like character ,  planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states .  the president's man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem .   perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it .
1	i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film .  although the acting may not be superb ,  the fight scenes are fantastic .  i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him .  in my opinion ,  the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production !  i hope you take the time to view this movie !
1	ooverall ,  the movie was fairly good ,  a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes ,  but chuck norris did hardly anything ,  except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters .  the movie was very similar to the events of sept .  11 ,  with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president  ( urich )  and threatening to detonate it .  judson mills had some superb action roles ,  taking out rashid's compound and various kick-butt roles but ,  there was a lack of chuck norris .  judson took over most of the action ,  leaving joshua  ( chuck )  with que on her computer .  but ,  overall ,  it was realistic and didn't lack the action ,  but only did it on mr .  norris' part .  i gave the film 7/10 .
1	if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris & judson mills then this is the movie to see . it has a lot of adventure in it . it is a great follow up to president's man . the chemistry between the main three stars ( chuck norris , judson mills , jennifer tung ) is incredible . my personal opinion . this movie along with the original , has turned out so well , that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series . if you've seen president's man , i recommend this movie for you . if you've seen president's man : a line in the sand but you haven't seen president's man , then let me suggest that you do . you will not be disappointed with either one .
1	composed ,  elegant carol  ( marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke )  ,  her nice husband eddie  ( likable david houseman )  ,  carol's wacky ,  constantly eating best gal pal anna  ( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan )  ,  and anna's hunky ,  amorous husband pete  ( a typically fine eric edwards )  are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other .  their usual routine gets disrupted when carol's lonely ,  repressed ,  but still alluring widow mother jennifer  ( a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles )  drops by for a visit .  pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle ,  with everyone except carol eager to seduce her .  writer/director joe sarno concocts a sharp ,  engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70's sexual revolution ;  sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother/daughter incest subplot .  moreover ,  sarno elicits uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast :  welles and brooke are both exceptional ,  with excellent support from edwards ,  jordan ,  houseman ,  arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara ,  and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs .  fields .  better still ,  all the women are extremely hot and enticing ;  welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence .  the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit ,  but never raunchy or tedious .  stephen colwell's bright ,  polished cinematography and jack justis' bouncy ,  melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective .  recommended viewing for sarno fans .
1	though not seen in too many films prior ,  you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since .    not one of grant's nor loy's best films ,  they make an outstanding effort together .  after all ,  with that much talent and very good supporting cast ,  you know the laughs will be there .   the film is light ,  has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through .   a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time .   definite saturday afternoon fare ,  heavy on the popcorn .
1	first saw this gem from joe sarno way back when ,  and i must say that after seeing it ,  i could never forget jennifer welles .  at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a sarno film ,  but when jennifer made her entrance ,  the first time i ever saw her anywhere ,  i was sat up and took notice .  her presence in this film is hard to avoid ,  and spices up every scene she's involved in .  i've seen most of the rest of sarno's films ,  and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles ,  and i must say that this was both sarno and jennifer at their collective best .  sarno's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb ,  and jennifer showed  ( figuratively and literally )  an acting prowess that make this a must see .  co-stars rebecca brooke  ( aka mary mendum )  and chris jordan ,  both frequent co-stars of ms .  welles ,  and also frequent stars of sarno's work ,  turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous ,  yet normal housewives .  this film is sarno classic .
1	ah ,  the 1970's .  a time when it was in to be a swinger .  to be honest ,  today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then .   joe sarno offers up a pretty good soft-core film .  in fact ,  just like today ,  some of the actors are famous hardcore actors .  unlike today ,  these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development .   it's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie .  two couples with open relationships re-ignite the wanderlust out of the milf of one of the women who has come for a visit .  not much more to it .   of course ,  when the milf is jennifer welles then it is a different story .  not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as ms .  welles .  it's worth the price alone to see ms .  welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's aphrodite .  she's no  " stifler's mom "  .  she's way sexier .   i also digged chris jordan's anna .  jordan looks and sounds so much like elaine joyce that i thought she might be her  " separated at birth "  twin or even elaine herself .  anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism .   unlike 1990's soft-core porn ,  70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism  ( something that 2000's soft-core has brought back on occasion ,  instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms )  and it is here in full force .  it's not real but it feels real .   for those who enjoyed the quebec produced  " deux femmes en or "  ,  you'll enjoy this one .  another classic film only on drive-in classics ,  the best $2 . 50 can a month you can spend .
1	this movie is far better than the original the jerk .  i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor .  we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty python .   the card game with the hobos and then with mr .  suicide .  the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup .  the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged .  while i like steve martin ,  he seemed like he was trying to hard .  the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone .  the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk .
1	honestly ,  when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off .  as i sat there for the next 10 minutes or so ,  i realized that the actor playing navin stole the show .  his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn't been in more comedies .  he has this  " marty feldman "  thing going for him but much ,  much more talent .  .  . taking nothing away from marty .  the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk ,  but then again ,  it was so much more .  i really think that if this movie was released first ,  and i saw the steve martin movie 2nd ,  i'd think the 2nd was a cheap rip-off .  i know it sounds like a bold statement ,  but it's true .  i actually like steve martin a great deal ,  but his performance is 2nd to the actor in the jerk too .  i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection .  i urge you to see it if you can find it .
1	i'm on the opposite end of the previous comment .   first of all ,  i don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to  " the jerk "  .  i mean ,  it's not titled  " the jerk 2 "  .  .  .  it's  " the jerk ,  too "  ,  which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same ,  it actually revolves around a completely different person .   think about it :  virtually no connection to the previous movie ,  other than character names ;  a totally different story ;  different cast ;  and the fact that it's a partial musical .   i say give this movie some credit .  it does have plenty of laughs in it .  .  mark blankfield at his prime .
1	i don't understand .  not being a critic ,  i am not evaluating the quality of the acting ,  which i find believable ,  a good thing .  my confusion lies with the content .  is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country .  should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so ,  what effect their cheating  " wives' "  infidelity had on them ?  while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness ,  did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily ?  they didn't think of their husbands at all !  only of themselves .  pardon me ,  except when they wished their husbands dead .
1	stuck in a hotel in kuwait ,  i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning .  first pachelbel's canon brought a lump to my throat ,  then the sight of a tiger moth  ( which my grandfather ,  my father and i have all flown )  produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe's name hooked me completely .  i was entranced by this film ,  crowe's performance  ( again )  ,  the subject matter  ( and yes ,  what a debt we owe )  ,  how various matters were addressed and dealt with ,  the flying sequences  ( my father flew avro ansons ,  too )  ,  the story - and ,  as another contributor pointed out ,  crowe's recitation of high flight .  i won't spoil the film for anyone ,  but ,  separated from my wife by 4 , 000-odd miles ,  as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot ,  i admit to crying heartily a couple of times .  buy it ,  rent it ,  download it ,  beg ,  borrow or steal it - but watch it .   ps did i spy a bristol blenheim  ( in yellow training colours ) on the ground ?  looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin- . 303 brownings in a dorsal turret .
1	i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched .  that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents ,  attempting to make sense of a world at war .  the ending and use of pachabel's cannon are both amazing .
1	i felt this film - throughout .  i waas impressed with russell crowe's talent in developing his relationship with lillie ,  such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach ,  a bit self depreciating and very persistent .  really loved the cinematography and direction .  pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive .   gosh ,  didn't russell's talent even in 1993 shine !   .  .  and i have yet to see gladiator .
1	i have just seen this film ,  and fallen in love with it .  there is a little bit of something for everyone ,  and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil .  when they are on the beach ,  i nearly cried .  .  .  there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together .  this idea taken from several angles ,  from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places .  the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last .  crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan .  i've always had a soft spot for the accent ,  but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character .  the way this film was shot is also beautiful ,  with the music ,  backdrop of the open fields ,  and superb acting .  all together ,  this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .
1	i enjoyed every moment of this movie ,  even though i knew they could never really be together .  with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks ,  it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940's who must have lived this story .
1	russell ,  my fav ,  is gorgeous in this film .  but more than that ,  the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow .  everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected .  the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity .  fabulous love story between lachlin and lil .  i replay their scenes over and over again .  anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people .  all characters are cast and portrayed excellently .
1	movie  " comedies "  nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor ,  foul language ,  and groin-kicking .  modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator ,  the undemanding and slow of brain .  sure ,  an occasional good comedy will come along ,  but they're becoming rarer all the time .    " mr .  blandings buildings his dream house "  shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of ,  and it's just screamingly funny .  jim and muriel blandings  ( cary grant and myrna loy )  decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs .  the film follows their story ,  beginning with house hunting trips ,  the house's riotous construction ,  all the way to the finished home--with its  " zuzz-zuzz water softener "  .   grant and loy are perfect for their roles ,  of course  ( grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control )  .  however ,  the film is stolen by the blandings' wise attorney ,  played to perfection by melvyn douglas .  managing to steal every scene he's in ,  douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis .  reginald denny as the blandings' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful .   i've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh .  i think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift ,  whether you're building a house or not .
1	very nicely done movie .  it does stay in your memory .  better billed as a romance than flying or war ,  altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free .  flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes ,  unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love .   fun watching early crowe .  he is good and exudes charm .  his reading of  " high flight "  is superb .   cheers ,  boom
1	`europa'  ( or ,  as it is also known ,  `zentropa' )  is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen .  the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless .  .  .  a true feast for the eyes .  the picture was a contender for a 1991's golden palm in canners .  the award went to barton fink  ( by coen brothers )  ;  a film stylistically very similar to zentropa .  here's an exercise in class :  rent both films and be a judge for yourself .
1	one of the great classic comedies .  not a slapstick comedy ,  not a heavy drama .  a fun ,  satirical film ,  a buyers beware guide to a new home .   filled with great characters all of whom ,  cary grant is convinced ,  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .   a great look at life in the late 40's .
1	this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life .  we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight .  a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don't just happen on the front .   luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents ,  grandparents or parents went through during a war .  this film ,  i think ,  is a small thank you .  peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be .  it's definitely worth listening to him recite  " high flight "  and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare .
1	japanese tomo akiyama's keko mask  ( 1993 )  is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch !  there are also some sequels ,  but i haven't seen them since these films are hyper rare .  some kind of re-releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films .  the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline ,  which is ,  according to the teachers ,  the most important thing in education .  the school is lead by incredibly funny looking  ( just look at the costume !  )  human wizard/whatever ,  who is like principal in the school ,  and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed .  well ,  the main thing about the film is its name ,  keko mask ,  who is some beautiful and masked fairy ,  who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers !  yes ,  this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background .  the most important thing is ,  of course ,  that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked !  her identity is never revealed in these films ,  and also the credits say  " keko mask :  unknown "  while the actor names are listed !   the most hilarious thing in this film is how keko mask kills her enemies .  she has a gorgeous ,  but lethal vagina !  yes ,  you read right .  she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them ,  spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view ,  after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs !  the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like :   " i've never seen such a beautiful vagina "  and  " now i can die in peace .  "  this film is totally fantastic !  !   there are also some great taunts towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films  ( japanese censors optically fog/blur all the pubic hair in any film )  and also about some restrictions among school students  ( like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc .  )  there's one great scene in which one nerd sees girl's bare you-know-what for the first time ,  and says  " hey there's no fog in it !  "  i couldn't help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this .  also ,  one character says in the end that he will return ,  if japan films allows to make the sequel .  i'm glad it allowed as i've heard the sequels are equally outrageous .  one sequel should include blues brothers  ( yes ,  those blues brothers !  )  in it etc .   this is trash in its most enjoyable ,  funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find .  this would definitely be even greater experience ,  if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point ,  but fortunately those segments are very few .  this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don't mention here and it wouldn't be even necessary to tell them all here .  if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek ,  i think you'll love this little gem as i do ,  and the director is definitely a genius in this field !  8/10 perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal ?
1	i turned this on to see the incredible ethel waters ,  whose autobiography i am now reading .  i'll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in ,  but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece .  it's pretty much a short film made by blacks ,  for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time ,  old trends exaggerated for humor .  we see modern black movies do the same thing ,  but with the new trends  ( stereotypes )  ,   " ho's "  and the  " hood "  and such .  i think if you look back in eighty years ,  you would find today's movies will look just as racist .  what viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of waters and the pint-sized sammy davis jr .  ,  who out taps his contemporary ,  shirley temple ,  and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult .  everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it .  why not enjoy it for what it is ,  instead of what you think it should have been ?
1	given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president ,  this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance .  for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant .  i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time ,  but also found the music and dancing incredible .  also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor .  he plays rufus jones ,  a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy .  he is told 'why some day you could be president' .  this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing ,  charming and funny .  the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man .  they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church .   the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in .  it is really well done and very entertaining .  i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us .  in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president ,  but that it is normal ,  just makes this movie that much more relevant .  it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness .
1	now ,  many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title .  if you do not have the stomach for gory movies ,  then what are you doing reading this review ?  anyhow ,  i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately .  this movie is chock full of wonderful gore ,  plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience !  if you're a lover of good quality experiences ,  then by all means ,  watch this great flick !
1	no ,  this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance ,  but it is brilliant in its own right .  you have to look at it for what it is ,  a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride .  those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden  " gem "  as they say and just didn't quite get there .  i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the  " 5 cent baby attached to a fish pole "  hahaha ,  well ,  yes .  i don't think a movie with a budget like this could afford  " good "  actors or effects so they worked with what they had .  the guts and entrails were actually very convincing .  the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall ,  this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability .  very good for a laugh .
1	well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen .  the effects are so bad you just have to laugh ,  and the acting ,  well lets say its no mel gibson .  but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad ,  he becomes good .  i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 .  you must see it if your in to horror/slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time .  killer movie .
1	why does this have such a low rating ?  i really don't get it .  .  .  is it because of the bad acting ?  the bad dialogue ?  well ,  who cares about these things in cheesy low-budget horror movies ?  seriously ,  the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies .  people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low-budget movies .  those movies shouldn't be taken seriously .  period .   anyway ,  time to talk about the movie ,  right ?  well ,  i loved it !  i bought it because i expected a gorefest ,  but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad  ( most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame )  ,  but i didn't really care because the movie is hilarious !  the characters are hilarious ,  the acting is hilarious  ( bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies )  ,  the dialogue is hilarious  ( bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies )  ,  the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious ,  the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on ,  but i don't want to say too much .  .  .  but i have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it's alive lol !  oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol !   best lines in the movie :   detective manners :  *sniffs coke* detective sloane :  what the *beep* are you doing ,  manners ?  what the hell did you snort ?  what the hell is that ?  detective manners :  it's nothing man ,  it's .  .  .  ehh .  .  .  cold medicine .  .  .   detective manners :  *injects heroin in his arm* detective sloane :  what the *beep* are you doing ,  manners ?  are you *beep* insane ?  detective manners :  it's cold medicine .   detective manners :  *repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face* detective sloane :  what the hell's going on ,  manners ?  what are you doing ?  detective manners :  this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock !  he just started smashing his head on the rock !  i think he's on pcp or something !   lol !
1	sure this movie wasn't like .  16 blocks ,  inside man ,  an american haunting .  etc .  .  .   but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us .  .  i found this movie really great and scary .   i live exactly where they filmed this movie  " san pedro ,  california "  and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie .   i dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach  " queen mary "  well that boat is haunted .  i believe in spirts ,  illusions ,  and parallel or however u spell that .  is real .  everybody's in there own universe .   and the mind is a powerful thing .   i recommend to watch this movie .  it's great ,  and not bad directing at all .   for those who rate it a 1 .  they don't understand the film .  its meaning .  its plot ,  its view .  and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us .   ty .   victor
1	i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating ,  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds .  as a matter of fact ,  they didn't - at least ,  so its seems .  some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie - that's it ,  this is what the majority of viewers think .  however ,  the surprise comes at the end ,  and unfortunately then ,  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie .  i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian-portuguese title of this movie means  " voyage into death "  .  this is the spoiler .   that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  ( on reasons that are completely unclear )  ,  you understand only in the last 5 minutes .  when you start the movie with the english title  " haunted boat "  in your head ,  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  " ghosts "  .  but in reality ,  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer-watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality ,  it is told from the perspective of the young girl .  we see her not alone ,  but together with the four friends because she sees them .  we do not see that she is alone .  so ,  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture-stream ,  but the main story !  we have at least two parallel worlds :  the world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are .  an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat .   i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie ,  the movie-makers  " cheated "  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film-student elaborate with hastily  " chosen "  pseudo-actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers .  how mistaken can one be !  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes ,  the end that follows gives another surprise .  the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat .  when she has recovered from her shock ,  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends .  and there they are again !  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore .  she jumps into the water ,  arrives at the boat - and they are away .  miraculously beautiful .  it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer :  when i awoke ,  i saw death standing at my bed .  but i closed my eyes .  when i opened them again - he was gone .
1	mr .  blandings builds his dream house may be the best frank capra/preston sturges movie neither man ever made !  if you love bringing up baby ,  the philadelpia story ,  the thin man ,  i was a male war bride or it's a wonderful life - movies made with wit ,  taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek ,  check this one out .  post wwii life is simply and idyllically portrayed .   grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire .  loy is adorable as his pre-now wife .  the cast of supporting characters compares to you can't take it with you and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker .  art direction and editing are way above par .   the movie never stoops to the low-rent ,  by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit .
1	i also saw this upon its release in '56 ,  and have been struck since then with its final scene .  if this is an answer to 'high noon , ' then it's an apt and apposite response .  the notion that ,  as this string is headed ,   " the town comes together "  is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of 'high noon . ' in this theme ,  'concho' is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all-time favorites ,  'the magnificent seven . ' both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances ,  especially sinatra's transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior .  i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i've inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves .
1	i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england .  i've seen hundreds of films since , but i've never forgotten this one . although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character , he was excellent in the role . a lot of people seem to think that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in  " from here to eternity "  but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho . the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad . i'd never see or heard of him before this film .  conrad plays a terrific part in this film . i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character . also i remember the music ,  that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears . an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again .  it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth .  i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color ,  i remember sinatra's blue shirt .
1	i've always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd .  frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one .   when we first meet frank in the film's title role ,  he's the brother of a notorious gunfighter who's out of town at the moment .  the brother strikes terror in the heart's of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow .  only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him .  she's the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams .   two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra's brother and he's coming to his town to take over .  they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town .  kirk follows him .   overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone .  it's a well acted performance ,  almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm .  pity for some reason this has not been seen for years .   two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark .  and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen .  he's a villain of incredible malevolence ,  pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen .   however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with .  let's just say i believe johnny concho was mgm's answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .
1	" still crazy "  is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all-time .  it has been erroneously compared to  " this is spinal tap "  ,  which it has no relation to .   " spinal tap "  is a satire  ( and ,  quite frankly ,  not a very good one ,  in spite of it's  " outing "  of many rock clichés )  .  unlike  " tap "  ,   " still crazy "  is populated by great actors ,  great songs and great human situations .  you care about the people in  " still crazy "  .  that's all that matters .  oh ,  yeah ,  the music's pretty damn good ,  too ,  written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze .  american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea  ( the crying game )  ,  but would only later become familiar with bill nighy  ( underworld ,  love actually ,  pirates of the caribbean ii )  and timothy spall  ( the harry potter movies )  .
1	dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned .  however ,  their film work has been much more chequered  ( 2008's the bank job was fine ,  the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak ,  for instance )  .   still crazy ,  fortunately ,  is a solid success .  it has a great story ,  excellent performances ,  a lot of humour ,  fabulous music and ,  above everything else ,  real heart .   i savour  " moments "  ,  and this film has one of them - just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance .  .  .   hugely enjoyable .
1	i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm ,  happy feeling .  i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time !  i thoroughly enjoyed this film .  the acting was superb ,  although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance .  bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films .  timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance .  and billy connolly ,  as always ,  totally gorgeous .  it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned .  such a refreshing experience to see a well-written ,  superbly acted and good-looking movie .
1	still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash-up r&r groups .  actually ,  here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out ,  whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison .  still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie .  people who expect spinal tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie ,  but i'd take a successful self-ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap .
1	wonderful movie with good story great humour  ( some great one-liners )  and a soundtrack to die for .   i've seen it 3 times so far .   the american audiences are going to love it .
1	i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it .  the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious .  another highlight of the movie is definitely the music ,  which hopefully will be released soon .  i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians .  go and see .  it's great .
1	i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years .  a successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try .  they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues ,  with hilarious results .  the music is fantastic ,  the script and acting are terrific .  the characters are spot on ,  especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice ,  makeup and personality problems .  the concert at the end was unreal .  go and see it ,  preferably in a cinema with a good sound system  :  )
1	another example of the unique talents of cary grant .  a performance worthy of oscar consideration ,  yet once again shunned by the academy .  mr .  grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city .  the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis  ( loosely )  for the more modern tom hanks vehicle ,   " the money pit "  .   if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex ,  this movie is a must see .
1	an excellent cast makes this movie work ;  all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie .   it's not quite the comedy i expected ,  much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor .  for music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny .   i hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies ,  but so much of this movie reminded me of alan parker films i can't help it :  imagine if the commitments actually did make it big -- and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later .
1	if you like deep purple ,  you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role .  the story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s ,  strange fruits ,  and they decided to play together again .  but ,  of course ,  there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts .  jimmy nail and bill nighy are great ,  and song  " the flame still burns "  is perfect .  you have to watch it .
1	this movie maked me cry at the end !  i watch at least 3-4 movies a week .  i seen loads of great movies ,  even more crap - ones .  but when ending scene - catharsic at it's core - came i cried !  and if you didn't - you have serious problems !  the story is archetypal - nothing new or original .  but it's real - because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist .  glam isn't my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70's .  .  .  at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine !  docudramas never really work very good .  but this movie really meked us believe it all .  .  . because they don't try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts ,  present musicians that are superheroes ,  groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb ,  they don't glorify drugs and alcohol ,  they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late .  .  .  once again great movie .  since  " leaving las vegas "  i was never so moved by a movie .
1	i didn't approach  " still crazy "  with any real anticipation .  just another rock'n'roll picture ,  i figured .  .  .  good nostalgia for the baby boomers .  this film is partially that ,  but so much more .  brian gibson ,  the director ,  previously helmed a biography of tina turner ,  and is quite successful in his style .  i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film .   the cast is well-chosen .  bill nighy is perfect in his role as the band's frontman .  actor-turned-director bruce robinson appears as the band's washed-up guitarist .  he does a superb job ,  even though he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's .  if you're looking for an touching and funny film  ( with some great songs )  ,  you've found it .   7 . 4 out of 10
1	i love this movie .  it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging .  congratulations !  !  i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves .  it is so eerie ,  you feel like you are watching a real life band .  i would like to see more movies like this .  i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked .  and even if billy connolly is quite well known ,  he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it .  congratulations again ,  i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy .  and when you get to the final scene .  .  .  .  .  well what can i say !  !  !  !
1	i thought this movie was fantastic .  it was hilarious .  kinda reminded me of spinal tap .  this is a must see for any fan of 70's rock .   ( i hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years !  )   bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit ,   stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together ,  but not succeeding well .   if you love music ,  and were ever in a band ,  this movie is definitely for you .  you won't regret seeing this movie .  i know i don't .  even my family found it funny ,  and that's saying something .
1	as an aging rocker ,  this movie mentions heep and quo - my 2 favourite bands ever - but with the incredible cast  ( everyone )  - and the fantastic storyline - i just love this piece of creative genius .  i cannot recommend it more highly - and mick jones added so much  ( foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever - lou gramm )  - i have watched this great work more than 10 times- bill nighy - what a voice - and jimmy nail - talent oozes from every pore - then astrid .  .  .  .  and karen .  .  .  .  .  what more could an aging rocker ask for !  !  10/10 - bloody brilliant .   alastair ,  perth ,  western oz ,  originally from windsor ,  england .
1	i agree with what  " veinbreaker "  wrote with regards to the  " ahhhh "  feeling you get at the end of this movie .  i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film ,  the songs were well written and interesting ,  especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings .  it's trippy .  nighy was fab in his role ,  nail  " nailed "  it ,  beano was the typical drummer ,  and rea kept it together .  bruce robinson was awesome .  helena was a lovely girlfriend .  but i felt juliet aubrey's performance was gorgeous .  the scenes between aubrey & robinson killed me !  perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on !  too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out !  they ought to ! i've told all my musician friends .  great quote by jimmy nail's character :   " it's supposed to be rock & roll ,  not the phantom of the f*****g opera !  "
1	i spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it .  my husband and i enjoyed it so much we bought the vhs and have enjoyed it ever since .   the plot has been well-discussed ,  so no need in going over it again .  the point is this movie deserves repeated viewings .  americans ,  especially ,  aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around .  i know i didn't .   this movie is funny ,  touching ,  sad-- all at the same time .  when ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding ,  it's cringe-inducing .  when karen calls tony  " brian "  as he attempts to kiss her ,  it's heartbreaking .  when beano is finally cornered by the woman in black ,  it's too funny for words .   and the music :  it's as good as any movie soundtrack i've heard in years .  i was dancing in the living room to  " all over the world .  "    every performance is absolutely perfect .  bill nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of ray ,  a man who has had one too many bad trips .  stephen rea is perfect as tony ,  the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for karen all these years .  he has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him .  but all the actors are equally brilliant .   ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it .  it's a gem .
1	in the voice over which begins the film ,  hughie ( billy connolly )  ,  a roadie for the great 70's band strange fruit ,  said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop strange fruit's set was that god was sick of 70's excess .  indeed ,  it's been popular to put down that era of music ,  and see punk as a welcome antidote to it .  while i agree the excess was tiresome ( as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it )  ,  and like punk ,  i still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock ,  and this film about strange fruit's long ,  strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days .   one of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes .  brian gibson directed what's love got to do with it ,  about tina turner ( while i had problems with the dramatic parts of the film ,  the music was handled very well )  ,  writers dick clement and ian le frenais co-wrote the commitments and were behind the music-oriented british tv show over the rainbow ,  and the songs strange fruit played were co-written by foreigner's mick jones ( not to be confused with the clash's mick jones )  ,  so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about .  also ,  two cast members are musicians in their own right ( bill nye i don't know about ,  though the film credits him with his own singing ,  and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era ,  while jimmy nail was in another british tv show which was music-oriented ,  though i forget the name ,  and he was in evita )  ,  and the others are convincing at it .  and while ,  as i said ,  a lot of 70's bands like strange fruit behaved badly towards women ,  the movie doesn't make the same mistake ( except for the woman who follows timothy spall around )  ;  as the manager of the reunion ,  juliet aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character .   the other actors are all good as well ,  with special praise to stephen rea ,  who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality .  there are a couple of plot points which don't work ,  but overall this is quite enjoyable .  oh yeah ,  and the music is good too .
1	if you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening ,  this is the film for you !  excellent script and perfectly cast actors .  i especially loved ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs - inspired !
1	so i rented  " still crazy "  instead .  when i described hardcore logo to the guy at the video store ,  he said that sounded kind of like still crazy .  so i rented it .  was i disappointed ?  well ,  yes ,  as still crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band ,  but that's ok .  still crazy tells the story of the strange fruit ,  a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival .  twenty years later ,  the band members are all struggling to make a living ,  and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival .  they take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis ,  touring europe in the process .  some quite funny hijinks ensue ,  and all the characters go through subtle changes .  watching this movie ,  you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant .  and that's not bad at all .
1	what happens to washed up rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990's ?  they launch a comeback / reunion tour .  at least ,  that's what the members of strange fruit ,  a  ( fictional )  70's stadium rock group do .   tony  ( stephen rea )  has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival .  it was at that festival in the 70's that strange fruit broke up .  the 70's are  " retro "  and the time is right to wide that wave .  he sets off in search of the other members of the band .   part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith ,  the lead singer and brilliant song writer .  the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came .  beano ,  the drummer ,  played by timothy spall  ( who was brilliant in secrets and lies )  is a layabout ,  the bass player is a roofer ,  and their lead singer is still a rocker .  while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it ,  as his fortune has not lasted .  brian ,  the lead guitarist ,  is dead ,  so a young guitarist is hired to replace him .   somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try .  abandoning their day jobs ,  they begin to rehearse ,  and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums .  but he wants them to start touring again first .  and so they hit the club circuit around europe .  the club scene is not kind to these overweight ,  dated ,  old rockers .   it is on tour that the film really starts to develop .  all of the old conflicts rearise ,  with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout .  they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier .  and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable .   still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film ,  following the relationships of the band members .  while it is still a very funny movie ,  it is the evolving characters ,  struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons ,  that make the film work .
1	this reminded me of spinal tap ,  on a more serious level .  it's the story of a band doing a reunion tour ,  but things are not harmonious between them .  i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray .  you felt sorry for him ,  yet he had a certain creepiness about him .  it's a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly , old and pathetic . bittersweet ,  highly recommended .  .
1	> contrary to most reviews i've read ,  i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies  (  " spinal tap "  ,  etc .  )  the story was more unique ,  although i feel most people wanted to see the  " sex ,  drugs & rock and roll "  vices that the band kept alluding to .   > as an american ,  i knew a few of the actors - spall ,  connelly & rea .  surprised to find out  " brian " /bruce robinson was in zifferedi's  ( <sp ?  )  classic  " romeo & juliet "  .  guess i'll have to rent that next .   >  " the flame still burns "  - my wife ,  who hails from mexico ,  didn't follow the english/british language too well ,  missed some of the jokes  ( which i dutifully explained )  but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene .  she loves the song so much now .   > funny that amazon . com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for $5 . 50usd .  price non-withstanding ,  i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since .
1	the funky ,  yet strictly second-tier british glam-rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's .  the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's :  morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck ,  vain ,  neurotic ,  pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries  ( and fails )  to pursue a floundering solo career ,  paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt ,  and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living .  former loving groupie turned patient ,  understanding ,  long-suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised ,  largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe .  our lovably ragged bunch try gamely ,  but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day .  scraggly zonked-out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy ,  trouble-plagued ,  but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride .   director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ,  ringing ,  flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general ,  this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve .  the astute ,  sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity ,  capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow .  ashley rowe's lovely ,  elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb .  kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered ,  but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success .  all in all ,  this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's .
1	i'm 60 years old ,  a guitarist ,   ( lead/rhythm )  ,  and over the last forty years ,  i've been in four bands ,  it's all there ,  the fights ,  the foul-ups ,  the rotten food ,  the worse accommodation ,  always travelling ,  little or no money ,  and every one was drunk or high .  but ,  the clubs ,  the fans ,  and the music ,  made it all worth it !  just like strange fruit !  i'm too damn old for it now ,  and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking ,  but for the length of that video ,  it all came back ,  and it was all there !  the birds ,  the brawls ,  and the booze !  and i was young again !  it's just like billy connolly's voice over ,  god likes that 70's stuff !  rock on forever !
1	.  .  . heads ,  hands ,  and feet - a band from the past ,  just like strange fruit .  a triple whammy there .  those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 ,  and have had no experience of the real thing .  sad for them .  this is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two ,  and will probably not even fade much on the second showing .  stephen rae ,  timothy spall as the fat drummer  ( in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all )  ,  and bill nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances ,  and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen ,  who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct .   the syd barrett/brian wilson echoes are loud and clear ,  mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness ,  and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute .  don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty - it's unfair on all of them .  the nearest comparison is the commitments ,  and that's no bad thing .  and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig - a band i do not remember ever seeing ,  but the name lives on - well ,  it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about .   a small delight ,  and thanks for the memory .   oh .  .  .  and i've got another one - stiff little fingers ;  a-a-and what about steeleye span .  .  .  spooky tooth .  .  .  ten inch nails anyone ?   ( you have to see the movie or have been on the road )
1	this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever- a british ,  better this is spinal tap .  the characters are believable ,  the plot is great ,  and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events- such as ray's problem with fitting in the band .   the soundtrack is excellent .  real period stuff ,  even if it is in the same key ,  you'll be humming some of the songs for days .  what i liked was the nearly all-british cast ,  with some of the favourite household names .  ray's wife is priceless .  .  .   the film never drags ,  it just goes at the right pace ,  and has some genuinely funny sections in it .  a generator of some really good catchphrases !   it's a hidden diamond .
1	musings :  pure delight from beginning to end .  not a laugh riot ,  but a more subtle ,  sophisticated humor .  what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors ,  including reginald denny ,  nestor paiva ,  ian wolfe ,  harry shannon and jason robards sr .  .    cary grant is at the building sight of his new home ,  which is at that point ,  being framed .  a young carpenter ,  played by future tarzan lex barker ,  asks him if he wants his  " lallies to be rabbeted "  ,  or some such thing that only a carpenter would know .  grant ,  not wanting to appear ignorant ,  replies in the affirmative .  at that ,  barker yells up to his mates ,   " ok boys ,  he wants 'em rabbeted ,  so .  .  .  . yank 'em out !  "  a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards .  all grant can do is moan .   yes ,  the movie is dated .  you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home ,  and a place like that ,  in connecticut of all places ,  would probably run a few million bucks .   a classic movie that is really a treasure .
1	what a good movie !  at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock :  illusions of fame .  well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten ,  not the music .  and with a good sense of humour .  have you ever danced on bill haley's rock around the clock ?   anyway ,  still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen .  far much better than spinal tap for instance .  why ?  because in still crazy ,  people are mature .  they have a different point of view about rock ,  about love and about life .  they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much .  beyond the story itself ,  we see characters with their own personality ,  weaknesses and dreams .  like anyone of us .   spend a good time watching this  ( listen to the awesome soundtrack !   ) and finally thinking of your own future .   bye !
1	i found 'still crazy' to be marvelously entertaining ,  and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s ,  early '70s rock .  my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd  ( don't worry ,  it's only been three times )  and she loves it too .   it is a truly loving ,  poignant and hilarious nod to the era ,  and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection .  it was my first introduction to bill nighy and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'love actually' brought him more attention .  bruce robinson was incredible as brian ,  bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype .  it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer .   i live in sherman oaks ,  california ,  and after the first time i saw the movie i bumped into billy connolly at the local mall  ( he lived here at the time )  and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time .  he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time .  we even talked of the idea of an american-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that .  why mess with the original ?   my only problem with 'still crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience .
1	hello ,  i was alanrickmaniac .  i'm a still crazy-holic .  it was just another movie i watched partly on tv .  then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends .  then i wanted the dvd ,  because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks .  after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack .  then on several film posters and the film script .  right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties .    how could that happen ?  what drove me into addiction ?    ok ,  it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce .    alright ,  the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''this is spinal tap'' ,  because of the characters ,  that aren't childish or ultra cool ,  but real .  this is a story about men getting older ,  too .  a story about men getting along with each other .  or don't .  it contains some of the best actors possible .  tim spall .  stephen rea .  bruce robinson .  jimmy nail .  and bill nighy .  bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film .   good ,  the soundtrack is unbelievable .  foreigner's mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit .  jimmy nail who plays bass-man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing .  we know that about jimmy nail ,  but if you've only heard bill nighy's singing in  " love actually "  ,  you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is .    well ,  you'll fever for every scene to come for the x-th time ,  especially those concert scenes .  you'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing  " all over the world "  ,  singing on the top of your lungs .  you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech's festival stage .    it's hard but .  .  .  i'm addicted to this film .  i'm addicted to strange fruit .  if there's a world where this band really exists i'd like to move there .    got still crazy .  .  .  anyone ?
1	this movie is tremendous for uplifting the spirits .   every time i watch it ,  i see & hear funny little things that i missed before .   the soundtrack is unbelievable .  mick jones  ( foreigner )  and chris difford  ( squeeze )  penned the songs ,  making strange fruit the best thing that ever hit today's music scene .   unfortunately ,  strange fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up '60's to 70's band that were never good to begin with ,  due to drug use and inner fighting .  one wonders what might have been ,  while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack .   the fruit draw inspiration from the rolling stones ,  deep purple ,  david bowie ,  and the who .   each member of fruit are quite memorable .  stephen rea stars as down-and-dead-broke tony costello ,  who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour ,  with hopes of reaping monetary benefits .  costello haply approaches ex-roadie karen knowles ,  played by juliet aubrey ,  to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past .   juliet gathers up the bitter jimmy nail  ( les wickes )  ,  blundering timothy spall  ( david 'beano' baggot )  ,  and extravagantly glamouresque ray simms  ( bill nighy )  .  tumbling in is another ex-roadie ,  the hippy-toker-jokester hughie  ( billy connolly )  ,  who never let the flame burn out .   as juliet searches for the last member of their motley band ,  the elusive guitarist-songwriter brian lovell  ( played by the brooding bruce robinson )  ,  the reunited members squabble ,  just like old times ,  fighting over each others' rusty talent .   the band is then given the chance to do a small dutch tour ,  to prepare for the festival .  with young hendrix-like luke shand  ( hans matheson )  taking the place of lovell ,  the crew hits the road .  the sparks fly as their memories flame forward ,  threatening to burn their unfinished goals .  .  .   be prepared to laugh ,  sing ,  cheer ,  and cry ,  as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts .  .  .
1	this series could very well be the best britcom ever ,  and that is saying a great deal ,  considering the competitors  ( fawlty towers ,  good neighbours ,  to name just two )  .   what made butterflies so superior ,  even to the best of the best ,  is that it did not just exemplify great ,  classic ,  classy and intelligent comedy ,  but it also expanded horizons ,  reflecting - flawlessly ,  gently ,  and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time .   i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it .  the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself .  this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones .  and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time .  then there were the decors ,  shop fronts ,  cars .  these people - even the layabout sons ,  with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated .  they were examples of the  " new europeans "  that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade  ( 1980s )  .   of course ,  the premise was strange and fantastic .  the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary ,  particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things  ( sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv ,  but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro )  .  and ,  if the premise was not surprising enough ,  the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme .  a potential affair that was not really about sex ,  or even romance ?  butterflies dazzled many ,  but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief .  .  .  at the time anyway .   butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic .  it documented ,  ahead of its time - post-modern ennui ,  all-pervasive lifestyle ,  the notion of emotional infidelity ,  and generational disconnect and male discontent  ( portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships )  .  it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way ,  and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place ,  and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come .
1	looking back over the past 28 years  ( since my first exposure to the show )  ,  all i can say is :  once you get it-it will stay with you forever .  i remember my initial reaction being :  1 )  annoyingly overacted ,  2 ) under produced 3 )  unlikeable characters  well ,  two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying .  a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness .  yes ,  the show has a style that is not for everybody ,  and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now .  but ,  i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times .  .  .    btw i am a married man .  .  .  ( for all who think this is a show for females )
1	british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types :  the quiet ,  introspective ,  usually romantic study and the farcical social satire .  settings ,  characters ,  and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories .  butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type .    the scripts are very verbal ,  including long interior monologues by the main character ria ,  a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life .  when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman  ( who makes his interest in her quite clear )  ,  she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered .   the acting and scripts are always on the money ,  which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one :  i was neither blown away by it nor turned off .  my mother ,  on the other hand ,  adored this show .  i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies .
1	johny to makes here one of his best style exercises ,  making a strong film with a good yakuza's story .  the election of the new yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization .   in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context ,  making a very strong gangs film .  i specially love the way he tells the history ,  moving around all the roles inside the yakuza's family ,  and making that we see the violence ,  like the only way they have to solve their problems .  .  .   talking about ,  the technical aspects ,  the film is a good example of paused ,  rythmic and planified way of shooting a film .  one of the hong kong films of the year .  is like infernal affairs ,  but without the easy action-violence scenes ,  and the confused storyline .  strongly recommended to all asian films lovers .    ( sorry for my english ,  better do in spanish lol )
1	this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy's law being applied to home ownership and construction .  if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional .  since it was set in the 'simpler' forties ,  we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era .  grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas .  their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment ,  7/10 .
1	enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama ,  the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man ,  no doubt representing modern society .  i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long .  i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie ,  the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest .  on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone ,  they are still there .
1	not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name ,  this is a stylised look at hong kong's triad gangs .  called election because a new leader or 'chairman' is elected by ancient traditions every two years .  two candidates are up for the position and through ego ,  bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least .  expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory .  the asian godfather this is not ,  but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence .  subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals .  either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right .
1	this isn't as violent as i was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective .   there are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on .   the plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the triad gang it follows .   the violence when it comes is brutal ,  no guns or martial art scenes with special effects ,  this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation .   the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable .
1	there can be no denying that hak se wui  ( election in english )  is a well made and well thought out film .  the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled  ( 1992 )  and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad' point of view ,  they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable ,  a good example being city on fire  ( 1987 )  .   election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes ,  spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful  ( if that's the right word )  manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces' of film-making .  it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure :  there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say ,  goes .  the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run .  needless to say ;  certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds ,  some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular .   election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third .  trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points .  i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested .  this happens a few times :  a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested ;  there's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested ;  some other triads are having a pre-election talk but the police show up and guess what ?  you know .   once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would ,  it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving .  the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been hotwired ,  another chase involving a motorbike and a kung-fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable ,  realistic and violent but like i said ,  they are in a 'tasteful' manner .  where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail .  when the triads are in jail ,  the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in cages as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict .  another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol ,  elevating themselves above other head gangsters who'd use champagne  ( the long good friday )  and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate .   election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise-en-scene as you look at what's going on .  some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies .  the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film ;  hinting at chinese tradition in the process .  i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly :  two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic ,  unpredictable and violent :  in a tasteful manner ,  of course .
1	election is a chinese mob movie ,  or triads in this case .  every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader ,  and at first it seems a toss up between big d  ( tony leung ka fai ,  or as i know him ,   " the other tony leung "  )  and lok  ( simon yam ,  who was judge in full contact !  )  .  though once lok wins ,  big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader .  unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters ,  this one is not an action movie .  it has its bloody moments ,  when necessary ,  as in goodfellas ,  but it's basically just a really effective drama .  there are a lot of characters ,  which is really hard to keep track of ,  but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit .  a 100-year-old baton ,  which is the symbol of power i mentioned before ,  changes hands several times before things settle down .  and though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70-minute mark ,  there are still a couple big surprises waiting .  simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture .   election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards ,  winning for best actor  ( tony leung )  ,  best picture ,  best director  ( johnny to ,  who did heroic trio !  !  )  ,  and best screenplay .  it also had nominations for cinematography ,  editing ,  film score  ( which i loved )  ,  and three more acting performances  ( including yam )  .
1	first off ,  i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence .  i say unfortunately ,  because after seeing election 2 first ,  election seems a bit of a disappointment .  both films are gangster epics that are similar in form .  and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema .  .  .  it's just not nearly as good as it's sequel .   in the first election installment ,  we are shown the two competitors for chairman ;  big d and lok .  after a few scenes of discussion amongst the  " uncle's "  as to who should have the chairman title ,  they  ( almost unanimously )  decide that lok  ( simon yam )  will helm the triads .  suffice to say this doesn't go over very well with competitor big d  ( tony leung ka fai )  and in a bid to influence the takeover ,  big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side .  this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war .  lok is determined to become chairman but won't become official until he can recover the  " dragon head baton "  ,  a material representation of the chairman's power .  the current chairman ,  whistle  ( chung wang )  has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first .   much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton .  as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides ,  which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election ,  which involves an underling named jet  ( nick cheung )  ,  a machete ,  and lots of bad guys .  nick cheung's presence is attention grabbing to say the least .  .  .  i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election ,  as he does deliver more of jet's character in the sequel .   while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance ,  i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film's actors .  election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting .  simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo ,  tony leung ka fai ,  and the under-appreciated suet lam .  there really aren't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they're watching real gangsters .   although the performances are great ,  one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to's eye for the camera .  there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots ,  as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles .  all of which makes election ,  above all ,  a great looking film .   my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election .  it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren't integral to the plot .  while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates ,  the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles ,  underlings ,  and police officers crowding the storyline .  maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad ,  or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more .    bottom line- all in all ,  this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast ,  excellent direction ,  and leisurely pacing that packs a punch .  it's just a little more complicated than it needed to be .
1	it might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films ,  but i think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place election occupies in the gangster genre arena .  it works somewhere in between the godfather and kinji fukasaku's yakuza opus the yakuza papers  ( aka battles without honour and humanity )  ,  in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic ,  dark and gritty .  but it's also a johnnie to film ,  and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur .   every two years the hk triad elects a new boss .  only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the triads and the police .  that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that .  as in the yakuza papers ,  there's a great deal of scheming ,  back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances  ( sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time )  which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict .  fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect .  election is not as action-oriented as one might expect ;  although it is violent .  and i'm not talking about the glossy ,  glamour version of hollywood violence .  this is dark and grim .  to's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims ;  after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not .   if you're familiar with to's style ,  then you should know what to expect .  the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate .  the cinematography is great ,  slick and dark in equal measures ,  utilizing dark hues  ( brown ,  dark green and orange )  while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it .  in the end ,  election occupies a peculiar place .  it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action-oriented gangster film .  it explores a situation  ( the election and its aftermath )  ,  but does so in style ,  and is both realistic and romanticized  ( the triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental godfather )  .
1	this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety .  those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides .   it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films ,  then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one .  i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film .  some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east .    people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior .  it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film .
1	johnnie to's election has some cool music on the opening creditsand a nice opening credits' design too ,  a kaleidoscope of chinese characters and those asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff ;  as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored .  i have found about to from bishop seraphim sigrist and was quite eager to see a to movie .  the one with which i began ,  election ,  is exciting and interesting ,  and only moderately violent by nowadays standardsmoderately and also essentially violent ;  the story of an asian godfather's scheming ,  it uses a puzzle play of elements ,  violent facts from the mobsters' lives ,  the race for the scepter ,  true details ,  and as with coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable .  the performances are reasonably amusing and colorful .   election is well made in the enjoyable ,  somewhat careless style of the hong kong fare ;  the ending is bitter ,  true ,  straight and will scare the kids .
1	i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival ,  where i went when i was in hollywood ,  that this film was in screening .  basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up ,  so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this .  the struggle is between  " candidates "  lam lok  ( simon yam )  and big d  ( tony leung ka fai )  for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society .  also starring louis koo as jimmy lee ,  nick cheung as jet ,  cheung siu fai as mr .  so ,  lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun .  there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments ,  just about enough action ,  apart from maybe when the cops get involved ,  but a sequel followed ,  so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller .  very good !
1	this movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace .  while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film ,  it is still highly watchable and entertaining .  it's sort of like someone said  " let's just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed "  .  considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas ,  the film works very well .  while the film has pretty modest pretensions ,  it makes the most of the material .  it's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family .
1	i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes ,  dude ,  i was wrong .   " election "  is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama ,  taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals .  characters are constantly on the move ,  and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider ,  it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters .  furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts .  although there's hardly any action ,  the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality .  cool movie that deserves more attention ,  and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit .
1	the first of two films by johnny to ,  this film won many awards ,  but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination .   the triad elects their leader ,  but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations .   tony leung ka fai  ( zhou yu's train ,  ashes of time redux )  is big d ,  who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes ,  even if it means a war .  well ,  war is not going to happen as that is bad for business .  big d will change his tune or .  .  .   good performances by simon yam ,  louis koo and ka tung lam  ( infernal affairs i & iii )  ,  along with tony leung ka fai .   whether masons ,  made men in the mafia ,  or members of the wo sing society ,  the ceremonies are the same ;  fascinating to watch .   to be continued .  .  .
1	personally ,  i find the movie to be quite a good watch .  it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized .   not only that ,  it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads .   overall ,  the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture .  nevertheless ,  the movie stays true to the real world ,  thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens .   i'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan .  another good watch would be dragon squad .  that movie has more guns than this ,  as in this movie there's more knives than guns  ( in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun )  .
1	there is so much to love in this darling little comedy .  anyone who has ever built or bought a house ,  or even just been short of space , will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr .  blanding . melvyn douglas , with great comedic flare ,  both narrates and acts as the blandings' attorney and voice of reason . as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife .  but the best performance is grant's .  he is the american everyman ,  especially relevant at the time of this film's release ,  when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war .  the themes are universal , lack of money ,  work strain ,  fear of infidelity . yes ,  it does wrap up awfully neatly ,  but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war ,  and wanted a happy ending .  it is still relevant today ,  and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down ,  gross out comedies .  the look of the film is slick ,  and there are some great bits of comedy is well ,  particularly toward the beginning . while it may have lost some of it's social relevance ,  nearly sixty years after it's release ,  it is still a gem .
1	despite a tight narrative ,  johnnie to's election feels at times like it was once a longer picture ,  with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved .  some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel ,  election 2 :  harmony is a virtue ,  but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions  ( though not the violence )  in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call .  it's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one ,  as the chilling ending makes only too clear :  one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander .   simon yam ,  all too often a variable actor but always at his best under to's direction ,  has possibly never been better in the lead ,  not least because tony leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful .
1	election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to .   to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d ,  as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society ,  a 100 year old trial society .   while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times ,  big d is not only impatient ,  but also thinks that he is on top of everything .  lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years .  to have the total control of the gang ,  the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton ,  which represents power and authority .  big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members .  he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok .   while big d is getting the baton ,  lok has other plans for him .   this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed .  johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie ,  where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one .  however ,  no single bullet is used ,  hardly any gangfights are involved in election .  it's the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest .   apart from maggie shiu ,  the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie ,  masculinity rules the whole movie .  louis koo and nick cheung ,  who was seen in to's previous film ,  are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively .  together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script ,  it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival 2005 .   election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie .
1	this film really deserves more recognition than its getting .  it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties ,  favours and allegiances within the crime world .  the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power .  this film is a movie goers film ,  it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end .  it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting ,  martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china .  it features an arrangement of great characters ,  actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film .  all in all 8/10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action ( there is action by the way )  so it loses some points for that .
1	i must admit ,  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'cut' last night ,  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem .  i am a true horror fan as true as they come ,  and found 'cut' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced ,  but one of the great parody/comedy films of late .   my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could .  i am certain this was intended as humour .  .  .  . hoping this was intended as humour .   and of course ,  there was the gore .   the use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes .  in short ,  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths ,  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth .   the appearance of both kylie minogue  ( short that her appearance was )  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic ,  as well as simon bossell  ( 'the castle' )  in a brilliant role as the jokey technician .   all in all ,  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years ,  as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end .   loved it .  go see it !
1	australia's first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang .  and a stab .  and a slice .  and a scream or two .  and plenty of blood ,  frights ,  red herrings and lots of laughs .   in fact ,  there's lots of first surrounding cut - it's the first script of dave warner's to be produced ,  although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation ;  it's the first major film from director and former hoodoo guru kimble rendall ;  and it's also the first film for producer martin fabinyi .  and for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time ,  they sure know their stuff .   cut tells the story of a bunch of australian film students who hear about a slasher film ,  hot blooded ,  that was never finished because its director ,  hilary  ( kylie minogue )  ,  was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film .   despite their lecturer  ( who was assistant director on the night hilary died )  warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of hot blooded again someone dies ,  director raffy  ( jessica napier )  and producer hester  ( sarah kants )  decide to go ahead and complete the film .  they put together a crew and manage to get the original star ,  vanessa turnbill  ( molly ringwald )  ,  to return to australia - in fact ,  to the original location - to complete hot blooded  14 years after shooting shut down .   of course ,  this being a slasher film ,  lots of bloodletting ensues  long with plenty of laughs ,  a few good scares and a rocking aussie soundtrack .  cut shows that australia can make a good ,  mass-market horror film just as well as hollywood .   it's a finely crafted feature ,  with excellent special effects ,  a taut plot and a killer - scarman - that's a welcome addition to the ranks of michael ,  jason and freddy .
1	i was really excited about seeing this film .  i thought finally australia had made a good film .  .  but i was wrong .   this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever .  i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie .   the acting was terrible  ( especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent )  ,  and the plot was also pretty bad .   when i first heard about this film coming out ,  i thought that the title was pathetic  ( because it sounds like the cheesy film  " stab "  in scream 2 )  ,  but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie .   warning !  !  !  major spoilers !  !  !   probably the worst thing about the film was the ending .  i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was .  .  but the killer wasn't even human .  .  which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie .   don't see this film .  .  you'll probably be disappointed !
1	i saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was ,  the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was .  well that was because it isn't supposed to be taken so seriously ,  basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job .  .  there seems to be another movie coming out like that too ,  umm .  .  .  scary movie ?  ?  well this is aussie ,  and original !  !  !  jessica napier does a surperb performance and sarah kants has a definate bright future in acting !  i hope to see more of them .  molly ringwald was a good move ,  and kylie was an even better move .  the impossible princess was queen of the screen !  !  i recommend seeing this flick ,  as you'll be guessing until the very end the connection with raffy ,  hilary and the movie that never got finished 20 years ago .
1	personally ,  i enjoyed cut thouroughly .  it was the first time i've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick .  a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films .   with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything .  i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies .  it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street ,  not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief .  i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres .   cut was original ,  scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun .  i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious .  it did what i expected it to do ,  entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying .  i enjoyed it .
1	i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it ,  which was sometime last year .  anyway i got to see today ,  and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so .  i thought that the movie was pretty good .  but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created ,  i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends :  final cut ,  i almost died it .  mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved .  cut is 100 times better than ul : final cut .  the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes .  the killer kicks mo f***ing ass .   i give cut a 8 out of 10
1	it isn't the worst film ever made ,  the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept .    it isn't the best film ever made ,  the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant .   it falls somewhere in the middle .  a fun somewhere .  an enjoyable ,  well constructed somewhere .   no need to say  " don't take it seriously "  or  " so bad its good "  or  " it wasn't scary "  .  none of these comments are relevant .    cut has atmosphere .  it's that atmosphere which is actually very unique ,  and the one really original aspect of the movie ,  which personally is what makes the film ,  for me .
1	" cut "  is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do .  most of the standard slasher cliches are there ;  the old creepy house ,  the woods ,  the anonymous indestructible serial killer ,  buckets of gore ,  and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex  ( that's hardly a spoiler )  .   the set-up is simplicity itself :  film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher  " masterpiece "  ,  unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast .  this also neatly - okay ,  messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel .  they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film ,  played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines .  the rest of the cast fit their roles well ,  especially the lovely jessica napier ,  who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her .   there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments ,  and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace .  it also has an appropriate low budget look ,  including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate .  good soundtrack ,  too .  if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre .  probably a bit of both .
1	this is not a bad movie .  it follows the new conventions of modern horror ,  that is the movie within a movie ,  the well known actress running for her life in the first scene .  this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose ,  and manage to do something new ,  and interesting with it .  it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the attack .   so this might be an example of what the genre has become .  cut hits all the marks ,  and is actually scary in some parts .  i liked it i gave it an eight .
1	this is surprisingly above average slasher ,  that's enjoyable and well made ,  with some decent gore !  .  all the characters are decent ,  and the story is quite fun ,  plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well .  i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$ ,  and it was surprisingly worth it ,  and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget ,  plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy .  the finale was really cool ,  as i loved how they defeated the killer ,  and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well ,  plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable !  .  it's decently made and written ,  and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well ,  plus some of the death scenes were very impressive .  this killer didn't mess around ,  and i loved it ,  and slasher fans ( like myself )  should really enjoy this film ,  plus the opening was really wicked too ,  with them filming the movie !  .  this is a surprisingly above average slasher ,  that's enjoyable , and well made ,  with some decent gore ,  and i say it's well worth the watch !  .  the direction is good .  kimble rendall does a good !  job here with solid camera work ,  using a creepy setting ,  good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace .  the acting is solid !  .  molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well , and i had troubles feeling sorry for her ,  after all she was supposed to be the heroine ,  she turned out better towards the end ,  but not by much ,  i'm surprised she decided to do this film ,  nonetheless she did an excellent job !  .  frank roberts is fantastic as the killer ,  he is menacing ,  creepy and had one hell of a mask ,  and this guy didn't mess around ,  he was fantastic !  .  kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role .  jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine .  rest of the cast are fine .  overall well worth the watch !  .  *** out of 5
1	for a slasher flick , this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre . yes it is predictable-resident nut job goes on killing spree , people die , yada yada yada . however there are some good positives in this film . first off , i really liked the mask the nut job wore . it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique ( although i haven't watched every single slasher film ever made ) also , the genesis of the bad due is something i haven't seen before , and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept , as far as i know . i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by mr sicko , for most of the murders . the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre , but that'a small concern . the movie does not take itself seriously , which is something most slashers suffer from . oddly enough , while watching the movie , i was reminded of the early  " friday the 13th films , which did take themselves seriously . there are a few concerns about this movie . in several scenes , the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons . by this , i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot , and also the way he walked . of bigger concern , however is a scene very close to the end , where mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance ( actually a complete rip off ) of another famous horror titan . and in the very last scenes , we have our scumbag , once again , looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned . in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip-off from another icon in the slasher genre .  these scenes were weak and unoriginal ( obviously )  . by the way , the movie is set in australia , so if you're a sucker for a chick with an aussie accent ( like me ) you'll be in heaven . if you not , than it just might grate on you . one other great thing about this movie : beautiful kylie minogoue ( just don't get too attached to her ) there is one non aussie accent , courtesy of molly ringwald . overall , there are more reasons to watch than not . i enjoyed it and had some fun . so , i have to give  " cut "  8/10 , which may seem too high to some people .
1	twelve years ago ,  production stopped on the slasher flick  " hot blooded "  since almost everyone on the set started dying .  now ,  a couple of film students have decided to finish the film ,  despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed .  well ,  they're about to find out that some curses are real .   when scream was released ,  every country seemed to want to cash in on its success ,  even australia .  the concept ,  which today has been done to death  ( a slasher film within a slasher film )  was at the time relatively cool and original .  this movie was released right before urban legends :  final cut and scream 3  ( well not in the us but in australia )  so it felt like the first movie with this concept .  when urban legends 2 was released ,  most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good ,  the movie flopped disastrously .  now ,  cut is not the best slasher flick ever ,  and nor does it try to be .  it knows that it's a rip-off ,  and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role .  but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story ,  they've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like  " nightmare on elm street "  as well and surprisingly enough ,  this actually works .  the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer !  and instead of trying to scare the audience to death ,  they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie .  there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore ,  the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie .  spoiler ahead ;  i mean ,  they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene ?  it makes no sense i tell you .  end of spoilers .  all in all ,  cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big .  i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel ,  but i guess it simply came out too late .    suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares .  cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous .
1	when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies ,  the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks .  really bad slasher flicks .  the formulaic type of film ,  where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made .   flash forward to the late '90s/early '00s .  the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's  " scream "  .  like in the '80s ,  these films were formulaic ,  masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as  " hip ,  tongue-in-cheek parodies "  of the original slasher flicks .  of this recent blend of  " hip parody "  neo-slasher flicks ,  the only one worth seeing is the low-budget ,  direct-to-video  " cut "  .   like most of the other  " new "  slasher flicks ,   " cut "  relies on the production of a slasher flick ,  in this case a fictional 1985 film  " hot blooded "  ,  to make its commentary on the genre .   " hot blooded "  never finished production ,  because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer ,  scarman ,  a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark ,  pupil-less eyes .  now ,  12 years later ,  a group of film students ,  whose professor was involved in the production ,  have decided to go into the vaults ,  tap the original surviving actress ,  and finish the film .  but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot ,   " scarman "  returns and someone dies .  to quote the tagline ,  will they finish the film before it finishes them ?   this all sounds really bad ,  and to a degree it is  ( really ,  is there such a thing as a good slasher flick ?  )  .  there is no character development  ( the  " new "  director is revealed to be the daughter of  " hot blooded " 's original director ,  whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled ;  this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot ,  yet it's never mentioned again )  and ,  like in all other slasher flicks ,  there are just too many bodies to care about .  the actors aren't great ,  even by direct-to-video standards ,  but most are having fun with their characters  ( and for those who aren't ,  it's inadvertent character acting ,  since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on  " hot blooded "  )  ,  particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman .   " cut " 's climax has no big  " who dunnit "  unmasking of the killer like in the  " scream "  films .  it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the  " urban legend "  films .  what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a  " this way we can write a sequel if it sells well "  ending .  but that's par for the course .   by any sensible viewing standards ,  this is a horrible movie that should be avoided ,  but this  " quality "  is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre ,  and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks .
1	a horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well .  it's about a masked killer .  the director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew .  he goes crazy and kills two people .  he's killed himself and the film is never finished .  twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but there's a curse .  people who try and finish it are killed themselves .  the students ignore that .  guess what happens next ?   the plot is old hat but this isn't bad .  .  . for what it is  ( a low budget slasher film )  .  it's well-made with a young and fairly talented young cast .  no one is great but no one is terrible either .  it also avoids the obligatory  ( and needless )  female nude scenes .  it moves quickly ,  the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence .  also molly ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress .   no great shakes but not bad at all .  i give it a 7 .
1	this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone .  our scrooge is ben affleck ,  who decides money is not enough ,  so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did .  ok ?  this is a great little high school soap ,  pg-13 ,  but the small sex references are comedy ,  so if your kid can't handle them ,  they can't live in the real world ,  either .   now ,  affleck is a hunk ,  and as usual walks through this fun ,  omg ,  remember when we did .  .  .  ,  ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease .  but that's ok ,  because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben's that well proportioned all over ,  well ,  there's hope for us ladies yet .  luckily ,  the rest of the ensemble--catharine o'hara ,  james gandolfini ,  christina applegate ,  udo kier and josh zuckerman--fill in and keep this shadow-side-ozzie-and-harriet christmas alternately hilarious ,  comfortable and warm .   this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn ,  and when you get back ,  everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed .   this is a happy film ,  after all ,  and it leaves you feeling good about life ,  love ,  family ,  christmas and chanel .  there really is something for everyone .
1	what's with all the negative comments ?  after having seen this film for the first time tonight ,  i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day .  when i saw that drew  ( ben affleck )  might end up spending the holidays alone ,  i wanted to cry .  you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why .  also ,  even though i liked tom  ( james gandolfini )  and alicia  ( christina applegate )  after awhile ,  if you ask me ,  they were real snobs .  however ,  this film did make me smile and feel good inside .  before i wrap this up ,  i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit .  now ,  in conclusion ,  i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it .
1	cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams .  it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations ,  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .   there are many great laughs  ( even if the story is somewhat thin )  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style .  a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses ,  which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience .  as he makes his exit ,  he assures the client  ( grant )  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100 . 00 from the total .  .  . or at least $50 . 00 .  .  . but certainly $25 . 00 .  hilarious !
1	come on people .  this movie is better than 4 .  i can see this happening .  .  . wealthy people have done crazier things than this .  and it was funny .   i watch a comedy to be entertained ,  escape from the pressures of the world for a short while ,  and not to have to take anything too seriously .  this movie fully suits that purpose .  i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles .  i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring ,  likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home .  it will remain on my list of  " favorite .  .  .  .  . must watch for the holiday season "  .  if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes ,  watch this one .
1	this movie was made in 1948 ,  but it still rings true today .  very ,  very funny .  it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  " builds "  from there .  anyone who has ever built a house ,  will find this movie very endearing .  great cast .  cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film .  this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's .  .  .  . clothing ,  architecture and family life .  many references are made to the cost of things ,  and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing .  i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely .  i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it .  a true classic .
1	you can survive surviving christmas .  i thought the television version was a bit edited way down .  i like ben afleck .  he plays drew johnson ,  a family-less adult ,  who is willing to pay complete strangers .  the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o'hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco ,  the daughter .  drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars .  bill macy who i best remember for playing maude's husband arthur is hired to play duda ,  the grandfather .  when the whole situation comes crashing down ,  the truth can be painful .  the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation .  drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit .  you can't buy what you wish for !  the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .
1	what's not to like about this movie ?  every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible .  this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well .  a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him .  what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it .  it was a win-win situation .  a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined .  only if .   drew latham  ( ben affleck )  was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands .  it was a fun and funny movie .
1	its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site .  it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection .  the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role .  i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it .  i rate it right up there with christmas vacation .  the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well .  the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act .  the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks .  plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money .
1	i had some reservations about this movie ,  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about christmas .  being in the middle of a heat wave in late june ,  we decided to give it a shot anyway ,  maybe we would see some snow .   this movie turned out to be one laugh after another .  ben affleck was believable in his character ,  but the real star of this one is james gandofini .  he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great  " dad "  .   if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours ,  definitely check this one out .
1	surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released .  ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas .  he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer .  i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past  ( though i did like daredevil and paycheck )  but here he is well cast in this role .  i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can't stand affleck's character at first .  sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care .  ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies .
1	at first i didn't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie ,  ,  boy was i wrong ,  my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all .  james gandolfini was funny ,  ,  i really liked christina appelagate ,  and catherine o' hara was good too ,  the storyline is what really sold me ,  ,  i mean ,  ,  too put up with family ,  ,  at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year ,  ,  and probably don't get along with anyway ,  ,  you really do need as much alcohol as you're system can stand to deal with christmas ,  ,  so i thought that the premise was good there ,  buying the family with 250000 dollars ,  was a little on the far fetched side ,  ,  but it turned out to work pretty good for me ,  ,  cause it was a riot all the way through ,  it shows the class struggle of the different families .  it has lot's of funny moments ,  including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy .  all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too .
1	what would you expect from a film titled 'surviving christmas'and presented as 'festive fun' ,  something like ghandi or english patient ?  there are lots of things i love about this film ,  it's funny ,  it is very well cast and it is superbly written .  i came to the film as a kaplan/elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot ,  it sounded ridiculous .  but the film doesn't come across like that because affleck  ( as drew latham )  plays his part perfectly ,  one minute a child-like adult ,  the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants .  in fact we see latham grow up in this film ,  when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good ,  he sees that his own lot is not so bad .   this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen .  comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama ,  it either works or it doesn't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time . i particularly loved the drama scene ,  where the family take to reading parts written by latham  .  the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco  ( james gandolfini )  and the comments of brian valco  ( josh zuckerman )  .  it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue ,  wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well .   the addition of daughter alicia  ( christina applegate )  into the story brings a delightful romantic angle ,  and why not in a christmas film ?  of course its corny and contrived ;  he's rich and handsome ,  she's beautiful and single ,  and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face .  great !  one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can't really complain .  i got what i wanted .
1	this movie isn't as bad as i heard .  it was enjoyable ,  funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season .  it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music .  when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection .  it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year .  i heard that ben's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time .  take it for what is it ,  a christmas comedy with a love twist .  i enjoyed it .  no ,  it isn't titanic and it won't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two .  so go laugh and have a good time :  )
1	i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt .  ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role .  gandolfini gives his typical a performance .  the entire cast is funny ,  the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome .  i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted .  i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy ,  can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives .  the best part to this film  ( to me anyway )  were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped .  namely ,  the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree .  go see it and have a good laugh !
1	this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 ,  so i was definitely going to watch the repeat .  i really sympathised with the main character of the film ,  because ,  this is true ,  i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had ,  dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  ( eb )  .  this is a sad ,  sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder .  jonny kennedy speaks like a kid  ( because of wasting vocal muscle )  and never went through puberty ,  but he is 36 years old .  most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition ,  and pealing off his bandages .  jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour ,  he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin .  he tells his story with the help of his mother ,  edna kennedy ,  his older brother and celebrity model ,  and jonny's supporter ,  nell mcandrew .  it won the baftas for best editing and best new director  ( factual )  ,  and it was nominated for best sound  ( factual )  and the flaherty documentary award .  it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 .  a must see documentary !
1	this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time .  jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration .  not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there ,  but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love .  watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching .  listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming .  and seeing him smile was indescribable .  i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant .  please ,  if you ever have a chance to watch this film - consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy .
1	i was greatly moved when i watched the movie . how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing .  so many people only care about what they want  ,  and fuss about all the things they don't have  .  and they are such small things  , like chothes , money a new car  .  i've seen people in tears because of a blemish .  this movie brings everything back to the basics  .  love , hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life . it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant .  you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food  , a roof over your head and your loved ones around you  . you are truly blessed . and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning . and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith , strenght , and humor with me  . thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above .
1	this man is nothing short of amazing .  you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events ,  and cry along with his family in the end .  he was so passionate about his cause ,  not just for himself ,  but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain .  i watch this video every time i am having a bad or  " down "  day ,  and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life ,  just like jonny did ,  even with his unbearable pain .  my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner ,  as i visited england 2 times during his life ,  and would have been able to say i'd met him .  it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud ,  pain free !  rest in peace ,  dear jonny .  you deserve it !
1	the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created .  i cried the whole way through ,  from start to end .  watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain ,  to live a life we would take for granted .  the first time i heard the title ,  i was almost scared to see the program ,  it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life .  i truly felt for him .  the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin .  could you imagine doing that ?  even more so ,  even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity .   ( debra ) jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration ,  he is the definition of a role model ,  what a true and undeniable hero he was !
1	in september 2003 36-year-old jonny kennedy died .  he had a terrible genetic condition called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  ( eb )  - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch ,  leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer .  in his last months jonny decided to work with filmmaker patrick collerton to document his life and death ,  and the result was a film ,  first broadcast in march ,  that was an uplifting ,  confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man .  not shying away from the grim reality of eb ,  the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full .  produced and directed by patrick collerton and first shown in march 2004 the boy whose skin fell off has become the most talked about documentary of that year .  it attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to jonny's charity ,  debra .  a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that jonny kennedy left a one million pound legacy .
1	i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy .  i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him .  i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition .  this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not .  i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools .  i also agree with other comments - what have i got to moan about ?  he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour .  god bless .  i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed .  i have enough trouble with my son's .
1	was flipping around the tv and hbo was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions ,  so i turned to my twin sister and said ,   " hey this looks like fun ,  "  - truly i love documentaries - so we started watching it .  at first i thought jonni kennedy was a young man ,  but then it was explained that due to his condition ,  he never went through puberty ,  thus the high voice and smaller body .  he was on a crusade to raise money for his cause .  he had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality .  .  .  i cried ,  watched some more ,  laughed ,  got up to get another kleenex ,  then cried some more .  once jonni kennedy's  " time was up "  he flew to heaven to be with the angels .  he was more than ready ;  he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free .  i highly recommend this .  if you do not fall in love with this guy ,  you have no heart .
1	i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary .  it was heart-breaking ,  disturbing ,  and inspiring all in one .  i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives .  or simply ,  something that will make you think .  you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life .  you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude .  at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual .  you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us .  his life and struggles will make you cry ,  laugh ,  and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time .
1	one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr .  blandings builds his dream house .  although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today .  still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham .   what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years .  returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans .  the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand .  around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft-ellender- wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business .   i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties .  like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester .  their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms ,  still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did .   of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up ,  threatening to send cary to the cleaners .  cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel ,  usually too late .  truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it .   myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles .  if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does ,  the film would still work just fine .   mr .  blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal .  and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years .
1	as with all of angelopoulos' films ,   " the suspended step of the stork "  implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer ,  a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work .  dialogues are sparing ,  with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts ,  doubts ,  or feelings .  the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses ,  and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves .  as a result ,  the acting is understated and implicit ,  as opposed to overt and explicit .   the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation ,  where the viewer is asked to become a participant ,  to participate as an actor ,  by probing his or her own psyche .  as in a novel ,  where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a template where the reader's imagination and/or past experience flourish ,  angelopoulos' drama rests within his images :  his uses of the long shots ,  the long takes ,  the leisurely pacing ,  the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark ,  inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective .  angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity ,  reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures ,  gazes ,  sounds ,  and music ,  when he believes that words can only take us so far .   the music ,  by angelopoulos' long time collaborator ,  eleni karaindrou ,  provides more than just a discreet background ,  but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story .  a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle ,  subdued colors ,  recorded in a drab winter light .  angelopoulos presents us with an  " other greece ,  "  one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures ,  with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas ,  drowned in an eternal sunshine .  here ,  the skies are covered and gray ,  the air is cold and misty ,  and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled ,  dirty snow of the village streets .  angelopoulos' genius through arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film .    " the suspended step of the stork "  is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century .  it is deeply concerned with the meaning of  " borders ,  "  and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations .  in the  " waiting room "  facing the albanian border ,  the refugees ,  political or other ,  outcast by the rest of humanity ,  wait .  they may be stuck against a political border ,  but unfortunately they still carry with them ,  and hang on ,  deeper ancestral borders :  those of the languages ,  of the customs ,  and of the races .  although angelopoulos' political views are well known ,  the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees' plights .  in the process ,  angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical ,  cultural ,  political ,  and personal  " borders .  "    angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece ,  and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions .  in this film ,  he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures ,  drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus' travel .  alexander is a telemachus ,  in search of a story about an aging greek politician/odysseus who disappeared ,  never to be heard of again .  this political man ,  a brilliant orator ,  unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence ,  his wife ,  and his brilliant career ,  to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low .  he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world .  of course ,  the  " politician "  is not alexander's father ,  but the  " politician "  stands before alexander like a father figure/odysseus .  as with homer's telemachus ,  alexander grows as a person during his odyssey .   of course ,  it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer's odyssey in a contemporary context .  angelopoulos draws on odysseus's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film .  in angelopoulos' ending ,   " odysseus "  is more like the dante's odysseus :  he does not leave for ithaca but goes on ,   " carrying a suitcase .  "  and alexander/telemachus is  " suspended "  between returning to his home and his career ,  or embarking on a voyage to  " somewhere else .  "  he states as much ,  in a voice-over at the beginning of the film ,  paraphrasing few lines from dante's  " inferno "  :   " and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again .  the wind blows your eyes far away .  "    finally ,  although angelopoulos is not a religious person ,  there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen ,  who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications ,  and also the christ-like figure of the  " politician .  "  in the final scene ,  these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography's influence in angelopoulos' work .  they appear like  " stylites ,  "  religious figures found in the orthodox tradition ,  solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars ,  in a form of asceticism .   the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni .  angelopoulos does not give us any clues ,  and the wife's statement ,   " it's not him ,  "  is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough .  the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician ,  but that he could be the politician .  but the film still ends on an optimistic note .  whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river ,  and thus communications across the border are still not possible ,  and it remains impenetrable ,  we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river :  the camera has crossed the border ,  and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary .  on this account ,  angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow ,  some of the borders will eventually crumble .
1	a most recommendable masterpiece ,  not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos ,  not to mention the acting of giants ,  mastroianni and moreau ,  and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis .  gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his  " tough "  partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character ,  which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl  ( khrysikou )  and the man  ( mastroianni )  ,  albeit hinted beforehand .   ( hence the spoiler .  )   get your expectations straight !  it's an  " art movie "  in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention .  not for spending free time ,  but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert .  due to the overall photographic style ,  large screen viewing is recommended .   dialogues are used sparingly .  but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian ,  kurdish and turkish ,  which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .
1	this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art ,  not an entertainment business .  lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating .  you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits .  the plot necessarily comes second ,  but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised .  just wonderful .
1	i loved this film .  i first saw it when i was 20  (  which was only four years ago )  and i enjoyed it so much ,  i brought my own copy the next day .  the comedy is well played by all involved .  i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr .  tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area .  also look for jason robards father who plays mr .  retch .  talent ran in that family .
1	enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially ,  william powell ,   ( dr .  lawrence bradford )  ,   " mister roberts "  ,  who played the role as a doctor and detective .  dr .  bradford was once married to jean arthur ,   ( paula bradford )  ,   " shane "  ,  and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time .  paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important .  jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe ,  especially with a jockey on a california race track .  robert armstrong ,   ( nick martel )   " king kong "  gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason ,  a detective who need the help of dr .  bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery .  if you see this film ,  just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days !
1	" the ex-mrs .  bradford "   ( 1936 )  ,  starring thin man series star william powell  ( this film was released the same year as the second thin man film ,   " after the thin man ,  "  comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films ,  but it nonetheless misses .  still ,  it is a wonderfully fun ,  highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein .   is myrna loy missed ?  of course ,  let's not lie .  however ,  i'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur .  and the chemistry between arthur and co-star william powell is real and it's fun ,  romantic and involving .   the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner ,  james edward grant  (  " the angel & the bad man "  )  is close to being up there with a thin man effort ,  but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle .   while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man "  movies  ( what else is ?  )  ,   " the ex-mrs .  bradford "  is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy  " who-done-its "  of the '30s & 40s .
1	william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in  " the ex-mrs .  bradford ,  "  also starring jean arthur ,  eric blore ,  and james gleason .  it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed .  though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple ,  the actor made a couple of other  " thin man "  type movies ,  one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur ,  both to very good effect .   somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty ,  debonair professional and  " the ex-mrs .  bradford "  is no exception .  the ex-mrs .  b has mr .  b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into .  and this isn't the first time she's done that !  it almost seems as though there was a  " bradford "  film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - mr .  b complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases .  this time ,  a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line .   the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point .  the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-mrs .  b .  jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny .  however ,  with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does ,  the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained .  i suspect the writer had something else in mind - say ,  the wacky side of carole lombard .  when arthur hears that the police have arrived ,  she says ,   " ah ,  it's probably about my alimony .  i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it ,  "  it's more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement .  it still works well ,  and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own .   definitely worth watching ,  as william powell and jean arthur always were .
1	i've seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great ,  but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur's chemistry in this flick .  jean arthur shines when she looks at powell .  there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them .  this film may not have the wit of the thin man series ,  but undeniably makes up for it in charm .  while i watched it ,  i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur .  my friends thought the same .  this is one film where i wish i could step back in time  ( to schmooze and lock lips with powell !  )  there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks !  powell's character ,  lawrence bradford ,  is probably the closest thing to the  " perfect man .  "  okay ,  this is sounding way too gushy ,  but i can't help myself .
1	rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia ,  for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man .  they succeeded to some degree .   a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles ,  bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role .  so by this time he was pretty well set in the role .  doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles ,  but the basic blasé nick is still there .  one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress ,  doctor bradford works for a living as a physician .  that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film .   he's got two murders to solve .  a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason .  the trainer suspects something afoot ,  but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet .  this is after he comes to bill powell for help .   myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was .  arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did .  but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry .   the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene/nat pendleton role .  all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell's butler was essaying that part .   if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films .
1	the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery ,  which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever .  powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's ,  and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells .  they are extremely fun to watch ,  so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold .  eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler .   powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio ,  but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script ,  so he eagerly accepted the assignment .  they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films ,  the canary murder case and the greene murder case ,  both in the philo vance series .
1	i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it .  a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan .   the story is pretty straight forward ,  and has been mentioned already so i won't go into it again .  needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for ,  and they do not disappoint .  only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed .  bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time !  all kicks and punches come with the all important  " type writer "  clicks and air  " whooshes "  ,  which is a cool effect though quite amusing !   i give this movie a b+ .  good but not great .  in a way i feel it could have been that bit better .  golden swallow ,  by the same director a decade earlier ,  had as good a story and better action .
1	the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k . f .  flick from the shaw brothers' stable  ( exc .  maybe master killer )  .  it has the artists who came to be known as simply  " the venoms "  ,  some of the best fight choreography ever ,  and ,  surprisingly for a kung fu movie ,  a great plot !  one of my all-time favorites !  !  !
1	five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas ,  but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in hong kong film history .  director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece .  this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms .  meng lo plays yet another bad ass .  he would go on to be in super ninjas .  kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled .  any chop socky fan can apperciate this .  but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas  ( also made by chang cheh )  .  but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best .
1	i recall seeing this movie as a kid .  i don't recall where i saw it .  i must have been around 14 years old .  i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again .  it came on the kung fu channel once ,  but i missed it .  i was really bummed .  it is the best special-effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date !  i highly recommend it ,  and now that i've discovered where to get it ,  i can enjoy it once more and for years to come .  i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly .
1	by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over ,  as films were moving in a different direction ,  comedically and otherwise .  with television looming on the horizon ,  hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time .  where ,  one wonders ,  would movies have gone had television not come along ,  or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years ?  mr .  blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed .   ad man jim blandings ,  along with his wife and two daughters ,  are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment ,  as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs .  so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications .  well ,  almost .  had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind .  then again he might not have .  you decide .  on this frail premise a wonderful film results ,  full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one .  nothing comes easy in this life ,  as mr .  blandings learns ;  but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way .  there is ,  after all ,  the long run .  but ,  blandings asks himself every few minutes ,  how long is long ?   this movie is a delight .  it is not ,  i suppose ,  a masterpiece in the capra-mccarey tradition ,  but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures ,  and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically .  there is real warmth in the picture ,  and a good deal of  ( w . c .  )  fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically ,  but not so much as to leave a bad taste .  the people in the film are all very smart and affluent ,  but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class .   lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr .  and mrs .  blandings to perfection ;  while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend ,  who often has to bring up unpleasant topics ,  such as how the real world works .  there is ,  too ,  a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia ,  which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years ,  as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place .  these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut .  in a few short years things would change ,  as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear ,  destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns ,  which soon would be connected by highways ,  littered with bottles and cans ,  their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city .
1	after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin  ( i bought it on dvd ,  hence the  " spin "  pun .  .  . i'm a dork )  .  the beginning was everything i hoped for ,  a perfect set-up  ( along with some quotes that i've heard on various wu-tang albums )  to what should have been a good movie .  but the plot i heard was so great ,  was so predictable .  every time i saw a character  ( except for the lizard )  i guessed which venom he was .  plus ,  the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie .  ok ,  so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right ?  wrong .  the fights were very short and few and far between .  granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer .  i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened .  i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened .  i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened .  in short ,  not much happens .  the fighting is all pretty routine .  don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot ,  it does not mean it's a good one .
1	when i was very young , on a local tv station , they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays . i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends . i remember lots of them . i saw great flicks like crippled masters , blind fist of bruce , kung fu zombie , shaolin drunken monk , rage of the master , tattoe dragon , and .  .  . five deadly venoms . i remember the day clearly . me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king . we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday . we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch , turned on the set and flicked it onto 56 . the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it . then under that was the title of the film . it said five deadly venoms . then the movie began . i bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence . i loved this movie the minute it came on . my favorite character was the toad venom . the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me .  .  . it was the fighting . the fights were so .  .  . amazing . i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended .
1	this movie is really good .  the plot ,  which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess ,  what will happen next .  such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle .  fighting scenes are very good .  there's a lot of different combat styles  ( although one of styles was a bit unreal for me ,  but it's only my opinion )  to watch and it's fascinating show .  the only thing which may be irritating is actors look .  a bit too effeminate  ( at least for me )  .  hong kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's ,  so  " five venoms "   ( or other its versions )  is great choice .
1	i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid ,  and i thought it was so cool !  now i am 26 years old ,  and my friend has it on dvd !  !  !   we got a case of brew ,  and watched this classic !  it lost none of it's original kung fu coolness !  if you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies ,  this is a must see .  .  .  the dvd is available .  i believe this movie is also called  " pick your poison "  .   watch it soon !
1	i really like this movie .  i can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it .  i suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie .   the story is very interesting .  it introduces us to 6 characters ;  each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly .  each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other .  the dying master sends the 6th venom ,  his last student ,  to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed .   how will the last pupil find the other venoms ?  how will he know which of them is bad ?  the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great .   we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination .  it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other .   if you want to see if you like kung fu movies ,  this is a good movie to start with .  it doesn't get any better than this .
1	if you love kung-fu films and you haven't seen this movie ,  you are cheating yourself .  this movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film .  normally ,  it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films ,  but this one has it all !  the story is well told ,  and complete .  the fight scenes are great ,  and tend to end before you're completely bored with them  ( unlike crouching tiger )  .  throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie .  see this one at all costs .  heck ,  my wife even enjoyed it .   wu du it !   9 out of 10
1	this is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late 70's .  the plot is interesting and twisty ,  the characters are cool each with their own style - toad ,  snake ,  lizard etc .  the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh / venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters .  i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang cheh's films are the same ,  most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts .  this film is breath of fresh air in comparison .
1	a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan . he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good .  the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake ,  centipede ,  scorpion ,  lizard ,  toad ,  while the last student was taught a little in each style .  all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money , and soon everyone is battling to get the money .   classic martial arts film has title that even many non-fans know .  i've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head .  its a very good movie ,  though i'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio  ( one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example )  .  this isn't to sell the film short ,  its not ,  since the film is structured like a mystery ,  our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is .  we're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is .  the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film ,  other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money ,  there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes .  its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention .   ( the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i've ever seen where there are no women .  i don't think one has a speaking role and i'm pretty sure that none appear in the background .  its indicative of nothing ,  its just something that struck me .  )  this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles ,  but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch .   around 7 out of 10 .
1	one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema  ( or ,  indeed ,  most anything done outside these holier-than-thou united states )  are the permutations that crop up .  in post-world war two japanese manga  ( comics )  ,  for instance ,  are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects ,  many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion .  the same thing happens in genre film-making ,  as well ;  though ,  again ,  i'm referring to movies made outside the u . $ .   ( where we're just too  " sophisticated "  in our close-mindedness to appreciate anything that isn't about or by us )  .  would an american company ,  for instance ,  back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler  ( el santo )  or a werewolf  ( paul naschy )  or a real-life martial artist  ( bruce lee )  .  .  .  ?  as for television :  forget it .  while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine ,  i've always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was- how to put it kindly- a bit lacking .  to this very day ,  there hasn't been a pay-per-view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia .   ( there are lots of soft-core porn masquerading as entertainment shows ,  but the so-called action channel ,  for instance ,  has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries .  )  before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc ,  there was ,  of all things ,  at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery :  the 5 deadly venoms .  in its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit  ( western ,  cop show ,  etc .  )  ,  this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work .  it's now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent ,  thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve .  if you're a martial arts movie fan ,  rejoice :  one of the greatest movie genres of all time  ( specifically ,  the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s )  are getting a long-overdue second life  ( and greatly appreciated second look )  on dvd .
1	" in the world of old-school kung fu movies ,  where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen ,  it took a lot for a film to stand out -- and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years .  what is arguably chang cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry ,  from the themes of loyalty ,  brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo  ( who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang )  during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's ,  to more modern movies like a man called hero ,  which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film .  the influence has also carried into other areas as well ,  from music such as the wu-tang clan ,  tv commercials for sprite and video games such as  " mortal kombat .  "  so what makes this movie so special ?  the plot -- on the surface -- is pretty simple .  it deals with members of a rogue group known as the  " poison clan "  who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu .  all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities ,  denoted by their animal styles ,  or  " venoms "   ( the lizard can climb walls ,  the scorpion has a deadly strike ,  etc .  )  .  the twist is that since the clan always wears masks ,  not all of them known who the others are .  thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller .  we're not talking the usual suspects here ,  but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time .  supposedly ,  golden harvest was not too happy with chang's script -- like most of his movies ,  they felt it was too dark and violent -- and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it .  thankfully ,  chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script ,  which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time ,  if not ever ,  completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences .   but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves .  chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast -- not only did he gain talented martial artists  ( whose moves ,  competed without the aid of wires or other special effects ,  put most modern martial artists to shame )  but great actors as well .  the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies .  getting back to matters at hand ,  in most old-school movies ,  the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts ,  but here the actors actually create characters .  it seems that everyone has a favorite venom  ( mine is philip kwok -- best known to many as mad dog from hard-boiled -- as lizard )  and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre .  even if you're normally not a fan of old-school movies ,  you need to check the five deadly venoms out ,  if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from .  "
1	there's no romance or other side plot to this movie ,  it's action and intrigue all the way ,  making it a real man's kung-fu movie .   an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who's styles represents five venomous animals centipede , snake ,  scorpion ,  lizard and the toad .  despite the word  " venom "  in the title ,  none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents .  yan tieh told by his teacher that he's no match for the five former pupil ,  must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four .  how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story ,  with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story .   recognized as a cult classic ,  this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies .  it's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story .   it's no artistic masterpiece ,  with the usual bad dubbing ,  and corny acting ,  but the movie is one of the best of its kind ,  because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time ,  and gives an extra concentrated dose of them .   one movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan .
1	of all the kung-fu films made through the 70's and 80's this is one that has developed a real cult following .  with the exception of all the films bruce lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story .  an aging kung-fu master tells his last pupil yang tieh  ( sheng chiang )  about five pupils he has trained in the past .  all five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently .  their specialty in kung-fu is the name they have adopted like lizard ,  snake ,  centipede ,  toad and scorpion .  the master called them the poison clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil .  an old man who was once a member of the poison clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target .  tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are .  tieh has discovered that the snake is hung wen tung  ( pai wei )  and along with tang sen kue  ( feng lu )  who is the centipede they kill a family to find the map .  a map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the scorpion but know one knows who he is .  a local policeman named ho yung sin  ( philip kwok )  investigates the murders along with his partner ma chow  ( chien sun )  .  sin has a friend called li ho  ( meng lo )  who is the toad and they do know of each others identity .  the snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on li ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed .  when sin finds out he teams up with tieh and together they go to combat tung and kue .    this film was directed by cheh chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films .  chang was not your run of the mill kung-fu director and his films always had a special quality to them .  while most martial arts films deal with revenge chang did not use that as a central theme .  even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that .  five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks .  then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is .  very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of changs stories were in a class all by themselves .  i wouldn't exactly put it in the same league as  " enter the dragon "  because bruce lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking .  this film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn't necessarily about fight scenes .  its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved .  that alone makes this different from all the other kung-fu films .  very well made with a unique story .
1	be careful with this one .  once you get yer mitts on it ,  it'll change the way you look at kung-fu flicks .  you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now ,  you will be wanting character depth and development ,  you will be craving mystery and unpredictability ,  you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops .  sadly ,  you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie ,  except for five deadly venoms !   easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time ,  venoms blends a rich plot ,  full of twists and turns ,  with colourful  ( and developed )  characters ,  along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s .  the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which ,  and who specializes in what venom .  one is the centipede ,  two is the snake ,  three is the scorpion ,  four is the lizard ,  and five is the toad .  each character has different traits ,  characteristics ,  strengths ,  and weaknesses .  therein lies the hook ,  we learn along with the student character ,  finding out who these different men turn out to be .  we are in his shoes  ( so to speak )  ,  and we have to pick who we trust ,  and who we don't ,  just like he does .  we learn along with him .   not only is the plot ,  the characters ,  and the camerawork great ,  it's also fun to watch ,  which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind .  it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on .  venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do .  .  . just don't expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it's gauntlet .
1	after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years ,  i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism ,  nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth .  the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his  " unfinished "  pupil out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan ,  so they do not seek out a fortune which the master's friend keeps hidden .  afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training ,  he instructs him to befriend one of the five  " venoms "  so as to defeat the other four .   i can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work .  a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made .  a classic !  !
1	well ,  i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie .  despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy ,  and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason ,  i was not disappointed .  the story was actually pretty interesting :  the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil ,  and who is using them for good .  the catch being that during training ,  all of the clan were masked ,  and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names .   the fights are a joy to watch ,  as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style :  toad  ( my favorite )  ,  snake ,  scorpion ,  lizard ,  and centipede .  the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place ,  and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action .   the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence .  but stick with it ,  and you won't be disappointed !
1	most 70s  ( and 80s )  kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies ;  usually there are a few well-planned fight sequences ,  but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes -- like porno films ,  really .   but this one does several things well .  most overtly ,  there is the direction and choreography ,  which confines each combatant to a 'style' -- it's really based on chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater ,  but the effect works .   second ,  there is the language of the camera ,  which uses some impressive techniques ( even by today's measure )  ,  changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion ,  and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future .   least overt ,  but most powerful and unexpected ,  is the construction .  the winner of this contest is determined by who 'unfolds' the story .  the master  ( the writer )  sets up a game where the lead character doesn't know who he's seeking ,  which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in .  one by one ,  he figures out who is who ,  at the same rate we find out who is who .  it all follows a tragedy/noir arc .  the ending tends toward irony ,  a la  " the sting "  .  much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre .   the 'five venoms' idea is the template for tarantino's 'deadly viper assassins' from the  " kill bill "  volumes .
1	for all the hoopla ,  respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians ,  it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas :  action and fight scenes .  but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i've ever seen in a martial arts film .  five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see ,  not only that ,  a movie you can watch again and again ;  but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better .  it somehow leaves you wanting something ,  you want more .  the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn't follow through with giving us more of the action we want .  the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer  ( centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard , toad )  and they are shown ,  but battles are noticeably short .  the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much ,  much more ,  in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie .  interestingly enough with this movie ,  the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot ,  this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome .  this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe .  sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel .  to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon .  the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more .  still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable .  my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this :  the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail ,  sad thing is  ,  the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on it .  i am left wondering what could have been with this movie ,  still one of the best though .  8 out of 10 on the scale .
1	seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately .  this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic .  i happened to see the dubbed version but i'm on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue .  still ,  the dubbing didn't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour :   " poison clan rocks the world !  !  !  "   the story-telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue ,  suspense ,  and inter-personal relationships .  you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace .   the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed .  it's like watching real animals fight each other ,  but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms .  such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema .   the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution .   .  .  . of course ,  if you just want to see people pummel each other ,  along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture ,  be my guest !
1	i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv .   the one scene that always stands out ,  for me that is ,  is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman ,  where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says  " did you get that ,  that's yellow ,  blue ,  green and white "
1	the five deadly venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery .  there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick :  great choreography ,  awful dubbing ,  different  " styles "  of fighting ,  and a wide range of greatly exaggerated ,  often cheesey human emotions .  however the plot certainly is better than average .  it's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes .  occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience ,  such as when x character receives horrible injustice .   another thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes .  just about everyone gets what's coming to them .  the cowardly ,  greedy ,  and corrupt lose out .  the bad guys ,  consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing .  the good guys use teamwork ,  planning ,  and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top .    poison clan rocks !
1	this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever ,  and may be one of the best movies ever .  .  .  it's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle ,  with lots of intrigue and suspense .  this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions ,  with people hiding their identities and their natures .  the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters .  they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality's and desires .   the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting .  it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy .  there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal .  the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film .  .  .  when this happens ,  the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel .  these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely .   one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death .  the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death .  this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective .  we actually care when people are killed in this film .  this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed .  some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching .  when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain .   at the same time ,  this is also a fun movie .  it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film .  there is bad dubbing ,  the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat .  some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic .  .  .  all this just adds to the greatness of the film .   and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries .  if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic .  everything goes by so fast  ( because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre )  that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is .  the lighting and composition are spectacular at times .  the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing .  .  .  in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example ,  imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed .  chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines .  he doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film ,  but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work .  he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people .   this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level .  it's art ,  it's trash ,  it's emotionally moving ,  and it's fun ,  it has a true sense of morality ,  but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action .  i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .
1	the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first .  the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off .  however ,  i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem .  i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy -- sarah's character is a true sociopath ,  very comparable to sedaris' jerri blank .   the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast .  her sister's character is good ;  funny at times ,  but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show .  however ,  the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison .   i'm glad ,  though ,  that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor .
1	i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes .  you people are so damn sensitive it is inane !  so quick to point out the  " racism "  of the show and the jokes ,  yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist ,  pig-headed crap like  " well ,  duh ,  some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women .  "  so disgusting .  abortion jokes are great because ,  really ,  who takes abortion seriously anyways ?  at least i'm not a*bore*son .  i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together .  talk about a movie of the year !
1	i have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review ,  takes pity on me ,  whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her freaky/funny world .  but in all seriousness ,  it was good .  first episode is obviously finding it's feet ,  but it's got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it .  it's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy ,  but that's good thing ,  too much has a laughter-track to it ,  and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh ,  it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all .  i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character .  well worth a watch ,  look forward to the following episodes .  a very good chance from the usual comedy out there .    ps ,  sarah ?  call me .  .  .  .
1	the sarah silverman program is  .  .  .  better than those other shows .  no laugh tracks ,  no painful jokes ,  just a program .  the sarah silverman program .  if you're like me ,  and you love comedy ,  this is probably a show for you .   sarah silverman brings out-there-funny ,  and right-here-funny to the table with ease .  a mix of different styles ,  which makes for its own .   this program isn't something you want to start a compare war with ,  seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them  ( other shows )  .  this show is its own entity ,  and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine .   go watch and see .
1	best show since seinfeld .  she's really really funny .  her total self centeredness ,  the hulking gay stoner neighbors ,  the departures into song or cartoons ,  make this the freshest show on tv .  one of the few shows i make point of watching .  the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore  (  " oh wait now that you're close you do look old "  turns face with finger and walks away lol )  ,  the cough syrup overdose ,  sleeping with god ,  it's all so funny or so stupid it's just a lot of fun .  the shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn normal !  !  i really can't wait until the next show ,  something i haven't felt for any show in a long time .
1	don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago ,   " the sarah silverman "  is wonderfully bizarre ,  surreal ,  immature ,  ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line-up .  if silverman tones down the juvenile  " doody "  jokes and emphasizes the darker ,  meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at ,  we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled  " strangers with candy "  .  but just from watching the pilot ,  its just solid ,  not outstanding ,  offbeat dark comedy/musical but with huge potential .    silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier ,  younger ,  jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional ,  non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television .  early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds .
1	the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah's own stand up ;  it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart .  the fact is ,  though ,  that while most all people will  " get it ,  "  it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it .  it's a very polarizing and one dimensional show ,  so if you don't like it after 10 minutes ,  you may as well give up there .  if you do like it after 10 minutes ,  stay tuned ,  because every episode thus far has been as good as the last .   like all shows ,  though ,  it is not perfect .  personally i love the program ,  but there are some huge faults with it .  racist songs are funny ,  but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize--a problem that i had with  " jesus is magic "  as well .  it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist .  not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good ,  the music ,  well ,  isn't .   another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python ,  upright citizens brigade ,  etc .  ,  it is nothing like those shows .  i can watch monty python all day ,  but ,  as much as i like this show ,  i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time .  it gets flat very fast .  the repeat value for this show is low too--the second time around an episode is fairly funny ,  and by the third time ,  in my opinion ,  it's boring .   still ,  that first time around is very ,  very funny .  give it a shot .
1	following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use .  the supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to sarah's erratic persona which ,  beyond general insensitivity ,  has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on ,  making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene .  sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed .  every time she speaks it's like a self-contained 5 second skit .  she overemotes a lot ,  demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify ,  but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied .  this may be the most creative ,  original and experimental tv program ever .
1	first and foremost i would like to say that i'm a huge sarah silverman fan ,  and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me .  everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form ,  maybe not directly funny ,  but the situation and the delivery are what counts .   if you liked jesus is magic then i don't see how you wouldn't like this .  it has that same flow and that same rhythm .  true it's only for the true fans ,  but if you are you'll be pleased .   again only for the true fans ,  there's no way around that .  if you're not used to her style then you wouldn't get why this is funny .  however ,  it is ,  and i hope you think so too .
1	this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud .  in other places ,  i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious ,  politically correct prigs .  there is neither here ,  unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid .   the lines are hilarious ,  and all the leads have never been better .  melvin douglas is especially brilliant .   if you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house ,  you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process ,  no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel ,  you are not alone !
1	when i first saw this show ,  i thought it looked interesting .  i watched it ,  saw how it revolved around sarah ,  like the character sees the world .  .  . revolving around her .  i got it ,  but wasn't laughing very much .   onstage and in her show ,  she's racist ,  crude ,  insensitive and hugely self-centered .  i didn't get her at first ,  and took it all at face value .  then i got to see her movie ,  jesus is magic .  i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me ,  explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking .  she's like marilyn manson ,  working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images ,  but you eventually realise it isn't an assault ,  it's a statement .  and once you understand that ,  you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight .   i don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand ,  or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy .  while i like a lot of 'smart' shows ,  i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm .  i get the impression that it's good ,  but i just don't get it .  many people will never get the sarah silverman program ,  but i'm glad i eventually came around .   the creators of this show do work hard ,  every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot ,  but with songs ,  or dream sequences ,  production numbers .  these people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers ,  they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together .  if i was to predict the future of this show ,  i'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks & geeks .  it will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on dvd .  but take heart ,  ssp creators ,  your audience is out there ,  and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show .
1	big s isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like ,  say mencia or chapelle  ( though i like them both )  .  she states the obvious in subtle ,  near subliminal remarks .  her show won't change the world ,  nor is it meant to .  but ,  along with the hilarious brian posehn and paget brewster's ex-boyfriend jay johnston of  " mr .  show "  fame ,  this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction !  my side's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode .  look ,  i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend ,  jimmy kimmel ,  she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run- with-it .  the best kind of comedy around .  spoofing anything and anyone ,  like  " mary poppins "  in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense .  this one is highly recommended ,  but only for those who still have a funny bone  ( and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job )  .
1	sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch !  she's beautiful ,  sexy ,  funny and talent ,  dark and demonic .  i read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get it .  nothing that appears on t . v .  is an accident .  too much money ,  time and work is put into the production of a t . v .  show for there to be mistakes .  this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid .  this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile .  i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre .  it's a lot like pee-wee's playhouse for maladjusted ,  slacker twenty-something glue sniffing ,  future pornstars of america from the valley .  the cast is awesome .  the scenarios and action is well-paced .  i hope this show succeeds since comedy central didn't let david spade keep his show .  who plays sarah's sister ?  she not in the cast listing on the show's home page .  i would love to see her stand-up .  does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there ?
1	i think this show is screamingly funny !  it's not for every taste ,  and i'm not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don't get it .  i'm sure they're wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength .  but if you like it ,  you really like it .  sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named  " sarah silverman "  who often finds her self in homerian predicaments  ( that's  " homerian "  as in  " homerian simpsonian "  )  .   i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90's .  i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she's done .   this show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny .  therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers .  check it out !
1	sarah silverman is like a totally manic zooey deschanel and i think i'm in love already .  yeah ,  if you loved jesus is magic ,  you'll love this .  if you didn't ,  what the heck is wrong with you ?  kudos to the comedy channel for shoving this in my face .  my life finally has meaning ,  and  " your car smells like farts "  is my kind of humor .  i'm a happy guy .  the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i'm hungrily looking forward to next week .  this is like grease meets south park .  completely outrageous .  sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book .  her delivery is precise and oh so funny .  she never skips a beat .  come to think of it ,  it's not so much her choice of material .  which is some really good stuff by the way ,  as it is the way she chooses to deliver it .  thank you ,  sarah silverman !  thank you ,  comedy channel !
1	i originally scored sarah's show with a nice fat 8 ,  but i've struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what's settled in .  i shall explain .   you will either like sarah's humor ,  or you won't .  if you don't ,  i doubt anyone could persuade you .  you folks know who you are and it's perfectly fine ,  but then you know that too .  moving on ,  the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah ,  her friends and family ,  and her pursuits in life .  in one memorable episode ,  she is  " pulled over "  by officer jay whom she meets for the first time .  -  " do you know why i am standing here ?  "  he asks .   " because you got all c's in high school ?  "  she quizzically replies .  it seemed to be a genuine question .  - that is funny stuff in my book .  sarah can come at you from odd angles .  in another episode ,  her affair with god was notably funny .  god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke .  it is clever ,  it is a twisted view ,  but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed .   then ,  came the second season .  while still not without some new and inventive comedy ,  we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes ,  quite simply .  i get some good laughs here and there ,  but much of it seems like filler while she ,  and the writers ,  struggle to foment some original material .  sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately ,  but i have been gutting it out for the gems i do find  ( the turtle )  and waiting for her to turn it around .  i was a fan of her  " jesus is magic "  routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of .  let's get back to that .
1	for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity ,  you are in fact the mindless one .  while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems ,  racial barriers ,  cliché's , stereotypes etc .  you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it .   what i also love is that not everything is a punchline .  for those expecting a formulated joke like friends  ( i love friends fyi )  ,  you won't find it here .  instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic .  we don't walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said ,  which is in most comedies .  instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense .    so don't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .
1	this show probably won't appeal to everyone .  sarah does what she wants ;  she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize .  this is a sitcom with zombies ,  robot dinosaurs ,  flying cars ,  and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders .  the star of the show is not a hero ,  she is a spoiled ,  bigoted pervert .  if you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers ,  the show probably isn't for you .  everyone should at least give this show a chance .  it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman ,  brian posehn  ( the comedians of comedy )  ,  jay johnston  ( mr .  show )  ,  steve agee  ( bobcat goldthwait's 'stay' )  and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon  ( heat vision & jack ,  monster house )  .  it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community ,  channel101 . com .   ( if you're into this show ,  keep an eye out for  " the department of acceptable media "  on vh1 this march ,  it'll be drawing from the same talent pool .  )   watch sarah silverman's show .  this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment .
1	this show is so incredibly hilarious that i couldn't stop watching the marathon on comedy central tonight  ( despite the fact that i've seen all the episodes previously )  .  i've always regarded silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience .  i watch this show and i laugh a very large percentage of the time .  .  .  i can't say that about many tv shows .  .  .  can you ?  this show is finally something new and interesting and  ( most importantly )  funny !  this is a show i will never miss and it is one i will buy on dvd as soon as it comes out .  you owe it to yourself to watch this show .  .  .  i predict a long run for this series .  .  .  and just to be clear ,  the people who are offended by this show just don't get it .  .  .  perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it .  .  .  they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand .  anyone who uses the word  " bigot "  in reference to silverman ,  or who claims that she only aims to  " shock "  .  .  .  is way off the mark .  .  .  she's exactly the opposite ;  just google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights ,  etc .  if you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints ,  you don't get it .  and if you don't get it ,  do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity .  .  .
1	all i can say is ,  if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie ,  then you're not human !  even after watching it for the first time ,  i was hooked .  it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe ,  as i'm sure other fans will attest to .  after watching it ,  you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us .  at least we have grey gardens to remember them !  i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with .  although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy ,  she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do .  what a rare treat to have know such people ;  i only wish i had !
1	great acting ,  great movie .  if you are thinking of building see this movie first .  the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same .  the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt .
1	i really can't remember who recommended this ,  but they said it was one of their favorite films .  it is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident .   someone said that truth is stranger than fiction ,  and the truth here is something to see .  i really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year .  how can you improve on this ?  the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton's .  in the process they become recluses and what is best described as  " crazy cat ladies .  "  they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie .  this film was done after that rescue .  all during ,  you couldn't help but think ,   " how bad was it before ?  "  it's a look at high society from the darker side ,  and it is utterly fascinating .
1	one of the best love stories i have ever seen .  it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion ,  but lovely nonetheless .  .  .  big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly ,  and are infinitely quotable :   " it's a goddamned beautiful day ,  now will you just shut up ?  "  the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever ,  and so will big edie  " the world famous singer "  and little edie  "  the world famous dancer .  "
1	it's interesting how the train of research can flow .  i started out looking at an article about cristo's  " the gates "  in central park .  the article stated that the maysles had been cristo's filmographers for years .  hmmm .  .  .  then i got to looking at their body of work .  i believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming cristo and jean claude in their stages of creation .  grey gardens sounded very interesting .  video station ,  in boulder co ,  is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock .  dvd and vhs .  edith and edie are women living in the past ,  and oh what a glorious past it was .  edith had been well off ,  born a bouvier ,  married well ,  had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties .  her daughter edie had been a débutante ,  a fashion model and had many beaus .  she never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate .  she seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind .  worrying too much about things .  it is only a shadow of the world they live in though ,  because jackie o .  came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted .  it is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out .  but ,  in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls .  if you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess .  the outfits edie comes up with a very clever and creative .  the viewer gets the impression that edith likes to go nude ,  but she doesn't in the movie .  edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings  " tea for two "  .  edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56 .  it was a good movie ,  though not for everyone .  when the cat is urinating behind edith's portait she states ,   "  at least someone is doing what they want "  !
1	i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill ,  jackie kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women ,  would encourage the maysles' to make  " big edie "  and  " little edie "  the subject of a film .  they certainly could be considered the  " skeletons "  in the family closet .  the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women .  i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating .   ( i . e .   " are they nuts ?  or am i missing something ?  "  )  .  this movie is hard to come by .  netflix does not have it .  facets does ,  though .
1	when it first came out ,  this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation .  luckily ,  it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema ,  especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television ,  and the bad evolution of most direct cinema .   really ,  at first ,  we must say that this isn't really direct cinema ,  it is more cinema verité .  the difference between the two is very slight ,  but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary ,  we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers ,  and they do interact with the characters filmed .  this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation .  the meysels have been allowed in the house ,  and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household .  and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed .   it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews .  here ,  we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house ,  a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith .  their house is a mess ,  litter and animals everywhere ,  faded colors and furniture all over the house ,  and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality .  these two people have lived with each other their whole life ,  and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention ,  but rather because they can't help talking to each other this way .  they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings ,  there is no need .  in the end ,  though ,  even as they blame each other for their lives ,  they really love each other deeply .  edie says she doesn't want her mother to die ,  because she loves her very much ,  and edith says that she doesn't want edie to leave her because she doesn't want to be alone .   but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age ,  the two women can't help be girls .  they cannot help being one the singer ,  the other the dancer .  exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera .  when edie asks david meysels rhetorically  " where have you been all my life ?  "  she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills .  a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again ,  the way only the meysels and few others could do .
1	little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for .  even though their house was filthy ,  this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness .  on the message board a poster wrote that  " little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old .  "  this reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version ,  big edie says to little edie ,   " if you're stuck ,  it's only with yourself !  "  these women had everything ;  beauty ,  talent ,  intelligence ,  firm belief in their opinions and actions .  perhaps if little edie wasn't so hard on herself the first time things didn't work out ,  losing her hair ,  her job ,  and the love of her life ,  she would have made it .  this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness :  her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead .  the world will never know what have happened if she didn't listen to her mom's plea ,   " come home ,  edie !  let me take care of you !  "   yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant ,  heartbreaking ,  and lovable ,  even in their extremely filthy home .  these women were extraordinary ,  and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness .  when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns ,  dwelling about what could have been ,  or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl ,  one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that  " everything will be okay !  "    great documentary !  !   9/10
1	grey gardens is a world unto itself .  edith and little edie live in near total isolation ,  eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their  ( apparently )  shared bedroom .  cats loll about while mother edith insults her daughter's elocution .  this is a tennessee williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights ,  as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real .   the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade  ( other than that they were poor and clean )  .  they would bicker all day ,  grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men ,  work ,  and self-expression .   this film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother/daughter relationship of this kind .  it is sad and voyeuristic ,  but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly .  it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context--remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .
1	i first saw this movie in my plays & playwrights course at tulane .  i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was .  it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude .  the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core .  **as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming ,  little edie became infatuated with one of the camera men . ** the beauty ,  i find ,  comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction .  it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little edie's rehabilitation to society .  in all ,  the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty .  two thumbs way up !
1	grey gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away .  it was so strange ,  and funny and sad and sick and  .  .  really no words can describe .  the move grey gardens is beyond bizarre .  i found out about this film reading my uncle john's great big bathroom reader ,  by the bathroom reader's institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue .  this movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed .  one should watch it for their favorite edie outfits ,  which i am sure include curtains .  when i get old i almost wish to be just like big edie ,  thumbing my nose at normalcy and society .
1	i knew about but had never seen grey gardens ,  before i saw the broadway musical of the same name .  friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie ,  the musical would not make sense .  it did ,  but it also prompted me to rent the movie .  at first ,  i thought it was a train wreck ,  full of strange ,  shrieking characters ,  and it was exceedingly hard to watch .  but being able to stop it ,  digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary .    both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing .  both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age .  they have a relationship that will chill any woman  ( and undoubtedly some men )  and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother .  in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace ,  it's fascinating to see the mayleses' work from three decades ago ,  and realize what an impact the film must have had .   i echo what other posters have said :  how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family ?  but beyond that ,  how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion ?  or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped ?  i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track ,  which gave me additional insight into the film .
1	i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot .  after many subsequent viewings  ( and purchase of the video )  it still makes me laugh out loud .   yes ,  it's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america - but well executed is well executed .  but it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism ,  the baby boom and the nascent consumer age .  this film is no  " guilty "  pleasure .   three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane melvyn douglas ;  bemused cary grant ;  daffily determined myrna loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters .   my favourite scenes -  " it means we gotta blast "  and  " miss stellwaggen "  and  " this little piggy "  .   love it .
1	fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale  ( big edie )  and her daughter  ( little edie )  aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis .  they live in a rodent infested ,  rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city .  it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric .  little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 .  the content is pretty much made up of two things .  the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer ,  actress ,  and dancer .  these discussions usually become very rhetorical ,  nonsensical ,  and often times amusing .  the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties .  each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad .  in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling .  very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it .  the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus ,  coming each day to record  ( and chuckle )  at whatever bizarre behavior may come about .  ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by .  their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in .  despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever .  for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness .  most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom .  her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .
1	grey gardens is shocking ,  amusing ,  sad and mesmerizing .  i watched in amazement as ediths jr .  and sr .  bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past .  their existence in a dilapidated mansion ,   ( which they had not left for more than fifteen years )  is both a comedy and a tragedy .  this is a film you will not soon forget .
1	i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title .  it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films .  it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully .  it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world .  i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it .  it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric beales ,  a true aristocratic family .  it has a tangible atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all ,  cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table .  it has an air of sadness that permeates throughout .  a fall from greatness for this once esteemed family .  the money had gone but their airs and graces remained ,  as well as their beauty .  it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate .  wondering that if i took a walk along east hampton beach i might still hear old edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper .  unforgettable .
1	excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies .  they couldn't live together ,  nor apart .  babbling constantly ,  sometimes at the same time ,  they hashed and re-hashed the past ;  going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda .  i found myself laughing at times ,  but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were .  see this one .
1	why should you watch this ?  there are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it !  superbly and amusingly directed by albert and david maysles ,  grey gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of east hampton ,  but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two edith bouvier beales ,  the aunt and cousin of jacqueline kennedy onassis .  their life was certainly an amusing one  ( edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas ,  edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats ,  one was named ted z .  kennedy )  the film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - edith died shortly after the film was released  ( in february 1977 )  aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and edie received after the film  ( she danced and sang in a nightclub edie beale jr was born in 1925 and is still living in miami beach . this film is both engaging and spellbounding .
1	the daughter's words are poetry :   " i can't go on another year .  i got to get to a hotel room .  "   " i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves .  "   " the marble faun is moving in .  .  . he just gave us a washing machine .  that's the deal .  "   " i'm pulverized by this latest thing .  "   "  .  . raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time .  "   "  .  . any little rat's nest ,  mouse hole i'd like better .  "  and there is wisdom in the mother's words :   "  .  .  . yes the pleasure is all mine .  "   " this little book will keep me straight ,  straight as a dye .  "   " always one must do everything correctly .  "   " where the hell did you come from ?  "   "  .  .  . bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music .  "   " i'm your mother .  remember me ?  "  the mother/daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film .  this is a mother's day film .
1	this is why i so love this website  !  i saw this film in the 1980's on british television .  over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life .  with barely a few key words to remember it by ,  i traced the film here ,  and much information ,  including the fact it's about to become an off-broadway musical  !   interestingly ,  unlike the previous comment maker ,  i do not remember finding this film sad ,  or exploitative .  on the contrary ,  the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength ,  honour and dignity .  ironic you may think ,  considering the squalor of their lives .  maybe it's because i live in britain ,  where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money ,  where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding ;  i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit ,  deep and profound humour ,  whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect .  in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult' .  over the years ,  as it faded in my mind ,  it shone the brightest ,  above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience .  it was such a deeply private expose ,  it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical .  but perhaps somewhere ,  the daughter will be amused by such an outcome .  it is she who will have the last laugh maybe .  .  ( they made a musical out of her before you jackie o'  )
1	i took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night ,  having no idea of the film's cult ,  influence ,  or that it is currently being staged as a musical .  (  !  )  most of the comments here are on target ,  it's moving ,  funny ,  sad ,  and yes ,  a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers .  the expanded chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out .    i think you can also see in little edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared ,  you can hear it in old films of jackie o too ;  people just don't talk like that anymore .  i think as a documentary ,  it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute ,  old edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree ;  couldn't she see the once spectacular home disintegrating ?    yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now ,  a real life tennesse williams one act .  well worth your time .
1	several years ago when i first watched  " grey gardens "  i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp .  years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it ,  but after many viewings i've come to see the beauty in the strange ,  twisted relationship between the inseparable  " big "  edith bouvier beale and her daughter  " little "  edith bouvier beale .   mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term  " shabby chic "  .  with innumerable cats ,  raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o .  allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day .  the result is a hilarious ,  beautiful ,  sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule .   the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love .  and their lives an example of drive ,  determination and free-will .  this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words .  it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself .
1	this documentary follows the lives of big and little edie beale ,  a mother and daughter ,  who lived as recluses in their family mansion in east hampton ,  ny from the mid-50s through the late 70s .  by the time the filmmakers find them ,  the mansion is falling apart ,  and the women ,  one 78 and the other 56 ,  share a squalid room .  the older edie beale is the aunt of jackie kennedy onassis and the younger is her first cousin .  the women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition ,  but jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there .   at times this movie can seem exploitative ,  as neither woman seems in the best of mental health ,  but at other times ,  the movie is hard to look away from .   " little "  edie blames her mother for her current state ,  and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was .   " little "  edie often seems trapped in the past ,  focused on choices she made decades ago ,  and loves showing off pictures from her youth ,  where she clearly was a beautiful debutante .  her mother seems more resigned to her fate ,  to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions .  there are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead ,  from the pictures that show a happy family ,  to the grand portrait of the older edie next to her bed .  from what we see of the house ,  most of the rooms in it are empty ,  the walls are cracking and falling apart ,  and  " little "  edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on .  and of course there are numerous cats running around .   at its heart ,  this documentary is incredibly sad .  while neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life ,  the squalor they live in is utterly awful .  it's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house ,  and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family .   however ,  as a documentary ,  the film is a wonder to behold ,  and is highly recommended .
1	i stopped short of giving  " mr .  blandings builds his dream house "  10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit :  the fact that a black person is the faithful servant  ( somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit )  .  but other than that ,  the movie's a hoot .  portraying middle class new york couple jim  ( cary grant )  and muriel blandings  ( myrna loy )  trying to build a house in connecticut ,  this flick has something for everyone .   grant is his usual flippant self ,  while loy does quite well as merely a wife .  but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim's and muriel's lawyer bill cole ,  who seems to have more plans than he's making clear .  as for the house itself .  .  . throughout most of the movie ,  you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there .  the builders ,  contractors ,  and others also provide their fair share of laughs .   all in all ,  a comedy classic .  also starring louise beavers ,  reginald denny ,  sharyn moffett ,  connie marshall and jason robards sr .
1	i saw this film a couple of weeks ago ,  and it's been stuck in my head ever since .  it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary .  to get the true story of the beales ,  i had to wade through all of the dvd's bonus material and commentaries and search the web .   although the maysles and their fans  ( not to mention edith and edie themselves )  bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative ,  this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word .  very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in - the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous .  the sound ,  even on the criterion re-release is poor and difficult to follow .  although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film ,  it's ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera's  (  !  )  far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from 1972 ,  four years before grey gardens was shot .   to paraphrase a review in the new yorker ,  there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives ,  and a documentary wasn't one of them .   as for edith and edie ,  the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was  " where the hell is their family "  ?  they were living in dangerous ,  unhealthy ,  unsafe conditions .  how is it that jackie o ,  married to one of the richest men on earth  ( or the wealthy bouvier family themselves )  couldn't afford to get edith and edie a decent home ?  or at the very least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both ?  it's shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family .   although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries .  perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary - bringing in the rich backstory  ( and afterstory )  of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the 1970's .
1	hey now ,  yours truly ,  theatrex ,  found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market ,  in almost new condition ,  and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a  " cult hit "  so of course it came home with me .    what a strange film .  the aunt and cousin of former first lady jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on long island  ( suffolk co .  )  and share the house with raccoons ,  cats ,  fleas  ( eyow !  )  and who knows what else .  suffolk co .  was all over them at one point for living in filth and old jackie herself came by to set things right .  anyway ,  this is one strange pair ,  big edie and little edie .  .  . edie  ( the daughter )  always wears something over her head and dances ,  sings ,  and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense .  big edie  ( the mother ,  age 79 )  apparently likes to run around naked ,  and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully  (  ?  )  done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that .  these women talk and talk and talk ,  mostly about the past ,  and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense ,  except to them .  they live in absolute filth ,  cats doing their business wherever  (  " look ,  that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait !  "  )  ,  and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations .  if i close my eyes and listen to big edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt ,  who was from that area of the country and had that lawn guyland accent .  one scene has little edie putting on flea repellent ,  lovely ,  you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested .  the box refers to these two women as  " eccentric "  ,  and i'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for  " wacked out of their gourds "  ,  but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them .  this is equal parts creepy ,  sad ,  and disgusting ,  but i couldn't stop watching once i started .  this is not my  " normal "  type of flick but i found it to be somewhat fascinating .  it won't be for everybody though ,  guaranteed .
1	i found grey garden's to be a gripping film ,  an amazingly intimate  look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea :  forget  society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge  brood of cats and raccoons ,  persuing their own interests rather  mundainly ,  all the while chattering at the camera .   big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros .   have chosen to document .  they seem like characters out of a  fellini film ,  only stranger ,  if that makes any sense .  old edie is  almost fully bedridden ,  a pile of papers ,  clothes and dirty dishes  growing around her .  little edie is even more interesting .  she  prances around the house ,  always wearing a baboushka-like  headdress around her head ,  completely covering her hair .  we  never see her hair throughout the film ,  nor do we ever get a hint  that she still has much .  at age fifty eight ,  though ,  she is still  beautiful and full of life .   in grey gardens ,  we get the sense that both of these women's  lives have become much less than what they once were .  little  edie is probably the sadder of the two .  while her mother ,  in her  earlier years ,  got married ,  made a family ,  lived luxuriously and  even made some recordings  ( the scene where ,  at 77 ,  she sings  along with a recording of  " tea for two "  she made decades ago is  one of the films best scenes )  ,  edie left her promicing career as a  model to take care of her ailing mother .  at 58 ,  she still longed to  find her prince charming .  if anything little edie is still a little girl ,   full of dreams of glamour and fame ,  and of domestic and romantic  bliss ,  that have yet to be fulfilled .   highlights of the film include the opening moments ,  where little  edie explains her outfit to the camera ,  the  " tea for two "  sequence ,   the birthday party ,  the climactic argument ,  the grocery deliver  scene ,  and the scene in the attic .  the whole thing is incredibly  candid and unpretencious .  and it's made all the more remarcable  since it's all real .   i suggest seeing grey gardens back-to-back with the kenneth  anger short puce moment .  the criterion dvd is $35 . 00 ,  but it's  worth every penny .
1	'grey gardens' ( 1975 )  is the maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east hampton ,  long island . 'big edie' bouvier beale , 78 , witty and dry and her daughter ,  'little edie' beale , 56 ,  ( emotionally about 13 )  a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future , live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic .  they amuse themselves by bickering all day ,  listening to the radio or singing to each other ( they dont even own a television )  their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special ,  although obviously ,  dysfunctional people . one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today .
1	one question that must be asked immediately is :  would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis ?   the answer is :  probably not .   but ,  thankfully ,  they are  ( or were )  the cousin and aunt of jackie .   this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence  ( one could hardly call it a life )  of edith b .  beale ,  jr .  ,  and her daughter edith bouvier beale  ( edie )  ,  has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you don't want to look but you have to .   big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton ,  new york ,  that is slowly decaying around them .  the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle .   magnificent oil painting lean against the wall  ( with cat feces on the floor behind them )  and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines .   living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others .   clothing is seems to be optional .  edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head .   as edith says  " edie is still beautiful at 56 .  "  and indeed she is .  there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there .   there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension .   their eating habits are  ( to be polite )  strange .  ice cream spread on crackers .  a dinner party for edith's birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils .   time is irrelevant in their world ;  as edie says  " i don't have any clocks .  "   their relationships with men are oh-so-strange .   edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness .  she says  " if you can't get a man to propose to you ,  you might as well be dead .  "  to which edith replies  " i'll take a dog any day .  "   it is obvious that edith doesn't see her role in edie's lack of male companionship .  early in the film she states  " france fell but edie didn't .   sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said .  both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other .   there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film ;  edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food .  the cats  ( and there are many of them )  are everywhere .   at one point edie declares  " the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility .  "  but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves .   this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort .
1	i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not ,  this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes .  i kept focusing on how these women  ( who are clinically way beyond eccentric )  reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways ,  and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe ,  perhaps some abuse ,  or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own .  this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation ,  without going completely over the edge - as the edies do their thing ,  i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom ,  cats urinating on the bed ,  racoons emerging from holes in the walls ,  and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong .  very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it ,  but very disturbing .
1	we stumbled upon the documentary ,  grey gardens ,  last sunday and got  " sucked in "  without warning .  everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach ,  eating ice cream and corn on the cob  ( which was cooked on the bedside table ) --and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words ,   " i thrive on it [the smell] .  "  we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in .  spellbinding !  a must see !  !  !  !
1	trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn't yet seen .  renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse .  my son is so jaded with current  " b "  science fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet .   it must be noted i didn't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia .  it must have been very quiet or i just missed it .   well this was a really pleasant surprise !  this is also no b movie .  it's not a  " blockbuster "  of the epic variety and doesn't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it's plot to be fully savoured .   the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view ,  but they get it right at it's 2nd appearance ,  & that aside everything else is top notch .  in any case the affects are secondary .   i won't give anything away about the plot .  the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct  ( though with very different content )  .   just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke .  the actor was born in cambridge england ,  and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect ,  it's a tad off key .  see the final twist of the plot and you'll see why that is such a brilliant choice !  and lucy liu is also just right with her  " will she kiss me - will she shoot me "  edge .   i rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them .
1	don't read anything about this movie  ( especially nothing that could contain any spoilers )  .  just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience .  if you like to see an intelligent ,  twisted story :  go ,  get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed .   " cypher "  is not really a sci-fi movie ,  more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business .  it's about corporate secrets ,  how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them .  the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness .  cypher is much deeper ,  more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much ,  much more satisfying than vincenzo natali's other movies  " cube "  and  " nothing "  .  actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen  ( and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick )  .  sorry ,  can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience .  just give it a chance .   ; - )
1	" cypher "  is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future .  while thematically not complex ,  this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ,  ruthlessness ,  and corporate conspiracy .  to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf .   the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man ,  morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  ,  who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative .  after an initial briefing with digicorp's security chief ,  sullivan is then given a new identity  ( jack thursby )  and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies .  upon successfully completing his first assignment ,  sullivan/thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered .  however ,  on one of his  " business trips "  he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster ,   ( liu )  whom he had met on his previous assignment ,  and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy .  the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp's main competitors ,  thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies .    (  ( spoilers end here )  )   what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes .  vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings ,  while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up .  i was also very impressed with jeremy northam .  not too often have i seen him in the lead role ,  and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant .  personally ,  i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles .  lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone .  additionally ,  the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job ,  however ,  my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated .  for example ,  i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second  " wife .  "  overall ,  this is a cleverly developed cloak-and-dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted .  with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work ,  this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future .  i'm surprised that i had never watched this  " hidden gem "  before .  this is a brilliant ,  not-too-overly complicated spy thriller ,  and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10 .
1	modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake ,   " the money pit .  "  older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia :  cary grant ,  myrna loy ,  and melvyn douglas were all  " superstars "  in an easier ,  less complicated era .  or was it ?  time ,  of course ,  has a way of modifying perspectives ,  and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary ,  there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older ,  seemingly less provocative films .  in  " mr .  blandings builds his dream house ,  "  there may ,  therefore ,  be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 .  there is political commentary ,  however subtle .  finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience ,  only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like .  politics in the movie ?  the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school  ( which in real life would get teachers accused of communism )  .  in real life ,  too ,  myrna loy was a housing activist ,  a democrat ,  and a feminist .  melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand :  he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas ,  whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism  ( and which ruined her )  .  jason robards ,  sr .  ,  has a small role in the film ,  but his political activism was no less noticeable .  more importantly ,  his son ,  jason robards ,  jr .  ,  would be for many years a very active liberal democrat .  almost the odd fellow out was cary grant ,  whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping .  but this was 1948 :  communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner .  it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films ,  and then not so subtly .
1	cypher is a clever ,  effective and eerie film that delivers .  its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands .  although one could immediately label the film a science fiction ,  there is a little more to it .  it has it's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir/detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story .   the film ,  overall ,  plays out like it's some kind of nightmare ;  thus building and retaining a good atmosphere .  we're never sure of what exactly is going on ,  we're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we're not entirely sure of certain people ,  similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i haven't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before ,  bar terry gilliam's brazil .  going with the eeriness stated earlier ,  cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective ,  noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there's something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well .   there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story .  the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster  ( liu )  ,  who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale ,  can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero :  people whom appear as friends actually aren't ,  people who say they're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look .  despite a lot of switching things around ,  twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they're not carried out ;  the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu's character  and she's trying to help out (  !  )  the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage ,  spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents .  the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-cold war ;  something that resembles the u . s . a .  and the u . s . s . r .  in their war of word's heyday and it really pulls through given the black ,  bleak ,  often cgi littered screen that i was glued to .    what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster's own motivation this sequence disappears because he's breaking away from the computerised ,  repetitive ,  controlled life that he's being told to live and is branching out .   cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film .  to say it resembles the first jason bourne film ,  only set in the sci-fi genre ,  isn't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities ;  despite them both being released in the same year .  like i mentioned earlier ,  there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict ,  you will find yourself enjoying this film .
1	although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built  ( or bought )  to your specifications ,  it is not the first ,  nor the last .  in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s .  kaufman and moss hart .  and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit .  the former was about moving into an 18th century country house that .  .  . err ,  needs work .  the latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s .  although the two films have their moments ,  both are not as good as blandings ,  which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name .   jim blandings and his wife muriel  ( cary grant and myrna loy )  are noticing the tight corners of their apartment ,  which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy  ( sharyn moffett and connie marshall )  .  although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive  ( in 1948 he is making $15 , 000 . 00 a year ,  which was like making $90 , 000 . 00 today )  ,  and lives in a luxury apartment - which in the new york city of that day he rents !  - he feels they should seek something better .  he and muriel take a drive into the country  ( connecticut )  and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want .   and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to .  for one thing ,  they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise ,  if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole  ( melvin douglas ,  in a nicely sardonic role )  .  for example ,  jim buys land from a connecticut dealer  ( ian wolfe ,  sucking his chops quietly )  ,  with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut .  bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth .  there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about ,  such as hard and soft water - which leads to the zis - zis water softening machine .  they find that the designs they have in mind ,  and have worked out with their architect  ( reginald denny )  ,  can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for .    the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim .  he has been appointed to handle the  " wham "  account  (  " spam "  had become a popular result of world war ii ,  in that the public started using it as a meat substitute ,  in the light of it's success with the armed forces )  .  jim can't get a grip on this  ( he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him )  .  he comes up with the following bit of  " poetry "  (  ?  )  :    " this little piggy went to market ,   he was pink and as pretty as ham .   he smiled in his tracks ,   as they gave him the ax -  he knew he would end up as  " wham "  !  "   his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one !   jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel ,  although  ( in this case )  bill is blameless .  but he's always around  ( jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one ,  and that he's keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes )  .  all three have mishaps ,  the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house ,  just as the men have left for the day .  they can't open the door ,  and jim  ( in a panic )  tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram .  he breaks a window ,  and the door opens by itself .   the film works quite satisfactorily ,  with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves .  it is one film which  ( despite changing price levels and salary levels )  really does not age at all .  after all ,  most americans dream of owning their own home and always have .   a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell's company has to do on the various rooms .  she carefully shows the distinct shades of red ,  blue ,  etc .  she wants - even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue .  the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job .  they proudly called loy  " mrs .  blandings "  in the commercials' introduction .  you can imagine though how the no-nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward ,  when loy leaves him with his paint crew .
1	cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick .  the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on .  the close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive .  the sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie .  the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive ,  however ,  the director makes good use of the props .    the character development is intentionally shallow .  the main character ,  jeremy northam ,  decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage .  it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end .
1	damn ,  i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it .   the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me .   the cgis are quite bad imho ,  but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just .  .  .  just a genius perfect combination for such a movie .  the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable ,  the plot is so good .   however although ,  the movie had little flaws ,  like e . g .  sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too  " slow "  ,  but i don't mean the scenic parts by that ,  i totally loved those .   also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story ,  like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps ,  where all their data is saved ,  and has this conversation with the guy down there .  .  .  but that may also just be me  : d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized ,  they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and  " louder "  but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again .  .  .
1	this movie is a gem because it moves with soft ,  but firm resolution .   i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there ,  it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace .  it's not about explosions ,  car chases ,  or flying bullets .  you must be patient and instead ,  note the details here .  it's sedate because that's what the main character is .  the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds .   i will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching .  the plot is what you've read from the other postings :  an average white-collar guy ,  seeking change and adventure ,  signs on for a corporate spy job .  just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data .    take it from there .   this movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential ,  underlying suburban paranoia .   then it begins to accelerate .   the acting on all parts is superb-- and yes ,  some of the acts are caricature characters .  but they all fit ,  and they entertain .  and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft ,  soft key sinister theme :  all is not right at the beginning .   and at the end :  all is not what it seems .   get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound :  this movie wants you to listen .
1	this is my first comment !  this is a fantastic movie !  i watched it all by luck one night on tv .  at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie ,  but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was .   i suggested to some friends to see the movie ,  only to tell me that it was a bad b movie .  how wrong .  superficial critiques .   i think that the movie is almost a product of genius !  the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time .
1	i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot .  but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now ,  and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !    what you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie ,  if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end .    the end is what makes this movie so good ,  you can't expect it .   congratulations to the producer  !
1	who can watch a movie ,  look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed .  that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress .  that's a tough combination to find now a days .  and jeremy northam .  i heard his name plenty of times ,  but i never really noticed him .  my advice to hollywood is  :   " use him more "  .   now about the movie :  i watched it in one of my graveyard shift .  i don't recommend that to anyone .  it's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that .  i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming .  i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie .  although saying this is spoilment enough .   now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie .  i love the dark mystic story ,  the actors did a good job & i love the directors  ( natali )  work in the past .  there's not a big audience for this kind of thing ,  that's also pretty risky .  you know what ,  i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this .  then again ,  1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement .

1	it's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond ,  as i'm sure he wouldn't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business ,  where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment .   " cypher "  is a pretty inventive sci-fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible .  you know the trend in these types of movies :  nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot ,  the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again .  the events in  " cypher "  supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world ,  where the major companies don't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other's thunder .  company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity ,  only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor ,  the sunways corporation .  sunways ,  on the other hand ,  constantly tries to unmask the digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies .  in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan ;  a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who's been selected by sebastian rooks  ( the über-spy )  to diddle the secret policies of both companies .  trust me ,  it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali  ( the dude from  " tube "  )  carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters .  the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem  " seconds "   starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style .  even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60's film ,  with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless .  there's also plenty of great action and suspense ,  most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions .  the middle section of the film drags a little ,  mainly because you already realize that it's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists ,  and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future .  jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side .  regular director's choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c .  dunn .   " cypher "  is well made and adrenalin rushing sci-fi entertainment ,  highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time .
1	this movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named digicorp .  this wimpy guy ,  morgan  ( jeremy northam )  is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy .  he is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies' plans .  instead ,  morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman  ( played by lucy liu )  and pretty much being double-crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent .  how will morgan get himself out of this ?  can he trust the beautiful but mysterious rita foster  ( played by lucy liu )  ?  and more importantly ,  can morgan make it out alive ?  wow !  what a nifty movie !  i was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie .  it is very suspenseful and you can feel morgan's fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive .  the scene where they put this horrible contraption on morgan's head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening .  morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished .  from a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses ,  he turns into a man actively fighting for his life .   the ending ,  wow ,  the ending is incredible !  the twist is so much fun !  it left me gasping and cheering like crazy !  good performances from all around ,  especially from jeremy natham ,  lucy liu and nigel bennett .   i highly recommend this film !
1	i'm a male ,  not given to women's movies ,  but this is really a well done special story .  i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job ,  while deniro is his usual superb self .  everything is so well done :  acting ,  directing ,  visuals ,  settings ,  photography ,  casting .  if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner .
1	if you came into the film with expectations ,  throw them away now ,  because no amount of hype will do this film justice .   to categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal .  it's a spy thriller ,  has elements of noir ,  bits and pieces of action ,  science fiction ,  and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative ,  mind-bending plot twists ,  and gorgeous cinematography .   a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative ,  both in good and bad ways ,  of other movies .  but as they say ,  every story cribs from shakespeare ,  so once you can get past that ,  you're in for a hell of a ride .   you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points ,  and while the set never becomes unbelievable ,  there are portions  ( read :  the elevator )  which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals .  don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci-fi channel movies ,  though ,  because this is on a much higher level .   if you're looking for action ,  you should turn away .  this is pure psychology .  but if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience ,  by all means ,  do it now !  watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it !
1	canadian director vincenzo natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube ,  which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s .  it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube ,  shot entirely on one set ,  and took this idea in fascinating directions .    i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow-up ,  and although its taken five years for him to mount another project ,  i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait .  cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world ,  and how through a completely logical chain of events ,  finds himself in a situation beyond his control .   i don't want to reveal too much about the plot ,  because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down .  it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head .  cypher is such a film .   morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  ,  one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet ,  is hired by the company digicorp .  they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars .  to his bewilderment ,  they are unbelievably boring .  covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese .   while morgan is waiting for one seminar ,  he runs into rita foster  ( an impeccably cast lucy liu )  ,  the definition of an ice maiden .  she gives him the brush-off ,  but there is something to her he finds irresistible .  that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in .    when rita turns up at another one of morgan's seminars ,  she tells him his life is not what it appears .  and i'm not saying anything more about the plot .  to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us ,  as well as the tortuous path that's so much fun to follow .   as with cube ,  natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people ,  taking them out of the familiar ,  and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown .  and cypher follows similar patterns .  but it's not a carbon copy of cube .  it has it's own inspiration .   cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories .  one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge .  when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle ,  it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him .   one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is .  where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns ,  cypher is also on a low budget ,  but natali economises it as much as he can ,  allowing him to broaden the horizon ,  and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity .   natali's direction is exceptional ,  with a deft hand on the reins .  there are some amazing camera angles from above ,  such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast ,  robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside .  all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture ,  which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir .   the acting is uniformly excellent throughout .  jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity .  his performance is excellent because it's so modulated .  he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes .  from a clinical ,  spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity .   david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube .  he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black .  his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia .  he is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents ,  and it's a fantastic piece of writing ,  brilliantly acted by hewlett .  all he has to do is look at morgan ,  and we're drawn into his complex mind game .   but it's lucy liu who's the scene stealer here .  too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect .  but in cypher ,  she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove .  rita is an aloof ,  guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish .  i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control ,  and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone .   things come to a very gratifying end ,  that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did .  but morgan deserves his happy ending .  after he's been put through the ringer like this ,  i cheered for him in the final scene .  it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes .   cypher succeeds on all counts .  engaging ,  shocking ,  always entertaining ,  it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't .  and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix .   a fine follow-up from natali .  and now i'm a committed fan of the man .  superb stuff !
1	director vincenzo natali's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which ,  although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration ,  manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience .   morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  ,  a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife ,  decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp .  his job is to travel to conferences across the country  ( under the assumed identity of jack thursby )  and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses ,  via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo .   in reality ,  however ,  the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities .  morgan ,  along with his fellow conference attendees ,  is being brainwashed .  the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma ,  during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities .  once they are totally convinced that they are someone else ,  they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies ,  where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion .   but digi corp's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster  ( lucy liu )  ,  who opens morgan's eyes to what is really happening .  she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques .  she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby ,  then he will be 'eliminated' .  morgan plays along ,  and applies for a job at rival business sunways .   however ,  arriving at his new workplace ,  he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy .  fortunately ,  the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent .   from hereon in ,  things get progressively more complicated ;  the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone .  in an exciting finale ,  all eventually becomes clear  ( but only if you've been following events very carefully )  .   director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget .  he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast ;  jeremy northam , in particular ,  is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection .   cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects ,  high rise and necropolis .
1	listen ,  i don't care what anybody says ,  as cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie .  cypher is not ,  i repeat not ,  a b movie .  cypher is an absolute masterpiece .  suffice it to say ,  i am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight .  i cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is .  cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made .  the technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime .  in fact ,  i must admit that cypher completely surprised the hell out of me .  in fact ,  i've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie .  other critics ,  of whom some downplayed the movie ,  have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about .  don't listen to the haters .  and actually ,  for the most part ,  reviews of cypher have been largely positive .  and it should be noted that cyher is not only a good movie ,  but it is also a fantastic movie .  cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted ,  that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics .  there is nothing wrong with or cheap about cypher whatsoever .  again ,  the cinematography ,  the backdrops ,  the technology ,  the storyline ,  and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch .  naturally ,  i won't give anything away .  this is not a spoiler .  and though it is the contention of some critics that cypher should have been in movie theaters ,  i believe quite the opposite .  cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for dvd release only and not in a bad way .  cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves .  blade runner ,  1984 ,  brave new world ,  total recall ,  logan's run ,  jason bourne and impostor and deja vu .  .  .  look out !  cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the aonn multimedia research ,  5 star eternal spy movie hall of fame .  cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best .  hands down and hats off .  nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction .  the future is now .
1	in a near future ,  the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  is hired by digicorp ,  a huge corporation ,  to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors ,  sunways .  along his training ,  morgan is brainwashed ,  assumes a new identity of jack thursby and travels to boring lectures .  in one of them ,  he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious rita foster  ( lucy liu )  ,  who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be .  morgan acknowledges a new reality ,  where he does not know who can be trusted .   the unknown  " cypher "  was a great surprise for me .  this movie has not been released in brazil ,  but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex ,  with many plot points ,  and with great screenplay ,  direction and performances .  in the very last twist ,  i recalled arnold schwarzenegger's  " total recall "  .  this movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once ,  and i really did not like the last scene ,  when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea .  in only know the director vicenzo natali from the fantastic  " cube "  ,  and this second work i see is also stunning .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :  not available
1	this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali .  the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen .  the film is superbly shot ,  i love the cinematography in this ,  it feels fresh and original .  plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall ,  dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff .  morgan sullivan  ( jeremy northam )  is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp ,  a large technological corporation .  he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do .  it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen .  it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife .  after his first job things become strange ,  his habits change ,  his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares .  he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster  ( played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu .  )  he takes an instant attraction to .  however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems .  he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp .  the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies .  sullivan ,  whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on  ( the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages .  )  suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else .  digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence .  sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby .  digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it ,  they now effectively control what these spies do ,  except for sullivan .  when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp ,  make sullivan a double agent .  they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down .  samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system .  the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn .  he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him .  when a mysterious third party becomes involved ,  the person it is revealed that foster works for ,  sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent ,  who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for .  the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires .  the cast are great .  northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent .  he brings a great visual aspect to his performance ,  his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby .  lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact .  the rest of the cast are also good .   director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube ,  has a real visual flair .  he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look .  for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively .  the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films ,  it is up there with them .  the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this ,  that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident .  the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along .  this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states .  ****1/2
1	this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see .  while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise ;  it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive ,  despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film .  it's good to know that films like this are still being made  ( even if they aren't getting wide releases )  ,  and cypher is refreshing for that reason .  the plot twists and turns ,  which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery .  the plot follows morgan sullivan ;  a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons ,  to him ,  unknown .  however ,  his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita .  .  .   this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future .  this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type ,  with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange .  the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing .  you never quite know where you are with the plot ,  which serves in making it all the more intriguing .  the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars ;  jeremy northam and lucy lui .  northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale ,  and does well with his role .  lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent ,  but she has a look about her that just fits this movie .   cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent ;  but on the whole ,  if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film ;  cypher is the way to go .
1	jeremy northam's characterization of the stuttering ,  mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch .  his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit ,  done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face ,  neck and lips .  no matter the brainwashing ,  love has a way of persevering .  love also cannot be  " brainwashed in "  with either of his two fake wives .  in gradual stages ,  he begins to dispense with his glasses ,  to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses .  the music is fantastic ,  hypnotic ,  sexy and appropriately driving at times .  the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi  " film noir "  in the tradition of many classic thrillers .  i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu's portrayal ,  whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states ,  the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith ,  some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part .  she is just no match for northam's talents ,  but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author .
1	- having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city ,  jim blandings  ( cary grant )  finds a property in the country for his wife and children .  he's hoping to find the simple life .  but ,  building a house proves to be anything but simple .  as the headaches and the bills start piling up ,  so do the laughs .  will mr .  blanding's ever get his dream house ?    - what makes this movie so special is the three main actors - grant ,  myrna loy ,  and melvyn douglas .  any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own ,  so when you combine their talents ,  almost every scene is special .  grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role .  he is so good at playing the put upon husband .  loy is a always a joy to watch .  the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect .  and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years .  douglas also appeared in the old dark house ,  a particular favorite of mine .   - the movie is definitely a product of its time .  i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story ,  three bedroom ,  four bathroom house on $15 , 000 income a year .  throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful .   - however ,  for anyone who has bought or built a house ,  many of the situations and predicaments the blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today .  and that's where the comedy comes in .  how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected ?  - the biggest complaint i have about mr .  blandings is the whole  " wife in love with best friend "  subplot .  it's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented .
1	you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that ' .  .  . before you see it the first time , ' is implied .  i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week  ( and last )  was a very slow rental experience  ( not much great coming in )  .  i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too .  still ,  it did .   this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget .  it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark ;  just enough .  the entire film is you  ( the viewer )  trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns .  i would have given this film 10/10 ,  however some of the shots were pretty fake looking .  i don't hold that against this film too much ,  but i don't think it deserves a perfect score .   lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious  ( as always )  .  i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent .  nevermind her beauty  ( which is difficult )  ,  she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion .  and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed ,  as well .   jeremy northam does really well ,  at first ,  as quite a geeky corporate rat ,  willing to run through any maze to prove himself .  however ,  as he changes throughout the film ,  it's like night and day .  i know some fans of clive owen ,  jude law ,  or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this ,  but northam would/could/should fit that bill .  he's suave and cultured .  he's got a great bond posture and voice .  i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it ,  and rather down-to-earth ,  as well .   great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .
1	there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups .  it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers .  this film also included one of the most imaginative  " escape "  scenes in recent years .  the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller .   although the plotting of the film was convoluted ,  the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed .   in 1949 ,  george orwell suggested in his famous novel  " 1984 "  that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state ,  which would control minds and diminish human liberty .  it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film ,  it was not the state ,  but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker .
1	when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity ,  it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration .  that didn't really happen ,  surprisingly ,  and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear .  but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit .   the story is of a morgan sullivan ,  who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called digicorp .  his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company ,  while under an assumed and false identity .  his home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing .  however ,  things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on ,  he starts to question who he actually is .  this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up .  .  .   twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated ,  and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable .   it's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future ,  and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat .   highly recommended .
1	this is the definite lars von trier movie ,  my favorite ,  i rank it higher than  " breaking the waves "  or the latest  " dancer in the dark "  .  .  .  i simply love the beauty of the picture .  .  . the framing is so original ;  acting is wonderful ,  a must see .
1	a major moneymaker for rko radio ,  bombardier stars pat o'brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots .  o'brien and scott argue over teaching methods ,  while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley .  o'brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo .  scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese ,  but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck ,  providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers .  stylistically ,  bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films ,  with moments of subtle poignancy  ( the death of trainee eddie albert )  alternating with scenes of ludicrous  " yellow peril "  melodrama  ( the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans )  .  though it can't help but seem dated today ,  bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort  ( the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan ,  who'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940 .   anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film ,  please contact me at :  iamaseal2@yahoo . com
1	i wasn't sure at first if i was watching a documentary ,  propaganda film or dramatic presentation .  i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three .   admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable .  but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on .  we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment .   where this movie came together for me was closer to the end .  the scenes had a realism  ( at least as i perceived it )  that i haven't encountered often before .  you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants .  this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce .   the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan .  also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years .
1	there were a lot of films made by hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public .  seen today ,  some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are ,  but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation .  this film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values .  pat o'brien plays pretty much the same character he played in many other films  ( you know ,  the tough-talking ,  hard-driven but  " swell guy "  )  .  randolph scott is ,  as always ,  competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent  ( look for a young robert ryan as one of the bombardiers in training )  .  while the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews ,  the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched .  that it ,  perhaps ,  except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also very satisfying .  about the only serious negative ,  and this is mostly for nitpickers ,  is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and  " nuts "  like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won't notice .
1	i enjoyed watching cliffhanger ,  at the beginning when that woman  ( sarah )  was full of terror when she was slipping ,  i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see ,  your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster .  i did like watching cliffhanger ,  i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky .
1	this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle .  stallone is gabe walker .  cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists .  renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie .  stallone needed this role to get back on track .  snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ,  ice ,  cold and bad weather than finnish man .  action is good !  music in the film is spectacular .  the bad guy is john litghow ,  other stars micheal rooker  (  the portrait of serialkiller )  ,  janine turner  (  strong medicine )  .  the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie .  overall good movie ****/*****  remember extreme ääliöt :  special collectors edition ,  with good extras .  comig soon in finland straight to video .
1	good action show ,  but nothing new .  this one took place high in the mountains ,  which showed some nice scenery and such .  one man takes on a group of mercenaries ,  the lead flies ,  and he kicks butt .  it could have been called  " rambo goes to the rockies "  ,  it was that pat .  it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror .  not a bad picture ,  but just same ol' ,  same ol' .
1	this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded . this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights , a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well , an exciting plot , and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways . the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play . the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human , much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters . they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style , weakens the excitement factor . also , the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times . the script should have been more realistic and less  " talky "  . another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes . the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses . they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie . instead , they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences  ( ala  " a-team "  tv series )  as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops . this movie had a lot of all time great potential . crisper action sequences , better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level . i know this was not stallone's fault . i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer . sill a good movie though .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
1	this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie ! stallone was good as always ! michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain ! the music is fantastic especially the theme ! the movie is action packed and never dull ! if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger , you won't be disappointed !
1	while the prices have gone up a lot ,  and some of the details have become dated ,  any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie .  i know i did .   mr .  blandings ,  a new york ad executive ,  decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there .  he gets into one hilarious jam after another ,  from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties ,  as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control .  i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water .  they dig down hundreds of feet ,  but never find water .  yet only a short distance away ,  a few days later ,  the basement of his house-to-be floods !   cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined ,  and melvyn douglas is even better as blanding's lawyer and family friend .   the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 .  mrs .  blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing ,  and there's a black maid  ( horrors !  )  .  so don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 ,  and you'll enjoy it all the more .
1	cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor .  it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars .  it has great action sequence's ,  edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .

1	after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s ,  a glut of 'die hard on a  .  .  .  .  . ' movies cashed in on the wrong guy ,  wrong place ,  wrong time concept .  that is what they did with cliffhanger ,  die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career .   cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream ,  especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing ,  base-jumping ,  aviation ,  facial expressions ,  acting skills .  all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk .  stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse !  however ,  if you an forget all the nonsense ,  it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills ,  and unintentionally ,  plenty of laughs .   you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness ,  his tick every box band of baddies ,  and best of all ,  the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent ,  rex linn as travers .   he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal ,  he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be ,  it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death .   mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy ,  who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football ,  yes ,  you can't help enjoy that bit ,  hal needed a good kicking .   so forget your better judgement ,  who cares if 'that could never happen' ,  lower your acting expectations ,  turn up the volume and enjoy !  and if you're looking for qaulen ,  he's the one wearing the helicopter .
1	forget credibility  you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats ,  being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed ,  and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons .  .  .  especially when renny harlin is directing .    " cliffhanger  "  is no exception .  but the movie has numerous assets  :  breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed ,  stunning special and visual effects  (  the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film  )  ,  excellent musical score ,  welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension ,  and a solid cast  :  two heroes  (  stallone ,  star and cowriter ,  has the lion's share of the footage ,  but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground  )  ,  a charming heroin  (  janine turner  )  ,  and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever  (  priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall ,  but also rex linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it ,  leon ,  craig fairbrass  )  good ,  solid entertainment then  ,  if no credibility . as roger ebert wrote  (  about another film  )  " it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much .  "
1	the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo .  but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion .   the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill ,  suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws .  the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before .   the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation .  the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end .   good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then .  apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes ,  the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years .
1	this movie is just great .  it's entertaining from beginning to the end ,  you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie .  in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics .   sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker .  together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker .  and then ,  john lithgow ,  one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain .   and the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action !    brilliant movie !
1	cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains .  sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic .  for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief .  the rest of the cast including john lithgow ,  michael rooker ,  janine turner ,  rex linn ,  caroline goodall ,  and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie .  the action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are .  the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie .  the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable .  the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them .  the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one .  if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too .  overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action ,  drama ,  some suspense ,  excitement ,  thrills ,  and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch .
1	was this based on a comic-book ?  a video-game ?  a drawing by a 3 year-old ?    there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all ;  not the characters ,  not the dialog ,  not the plot ,  not the action .  nothing .  we have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids ,  stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather ,  dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious ,  and so on .  even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb  (  " tango-tango "  )  .  a film that entertains through some suspense ,  good action-sequences ,  and a nice snowy mountainous setting .  oh ,  yes :  and the unintentional humour .   the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a  " swell "  time .  then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part ,  which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out .  and then we have some more bad dialog ,  and after that some more great action .  this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell .    stallone's melodramatic exchange with turner ,  when they meet after a long time ,  is so soapy ,  so clichéd ,  so fake ,  and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer .  soon after this display of awful dialog-writing ,  we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane .  the entire action is one big absurdity ,  but it's mindless fun at its best .  although the rest of the action is exciting and fun ,  the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film .  after the landing ,  our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker .  they send stallone to fetch the first case of money ,  but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it ;  they take most of his clothes off  ( so he can freeze )  and they won't give him the equipment he needs  ( so he can fall off )  .  do these gangsters want their money fetched or not ?  ?  ?  very silly .  apparently they don't trust stallone ,  but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage .  nevertheless ,  our gangsters make stallone's climb difficult ,  if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts .  and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are ,  they overact ,  brag ,  and snicker in a truly evil manner .  everyone convinced ?  good .  you'd better be .  otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children ,  just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone .   the old guy who flies the chopper .  .  .  how the hell did he fall for the trap ?  firstly ,  he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals ,  and secondly ,  he must have heard stallone's and rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies .  a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place ,  with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines .   " get off my back !  "  lithgow :   " i haven't even started climbing on your back .  "  or ,  lithgow to stallone :   " we had a deal ,  but now we only have each other !  "  and as for lithgow's gang of murderers :  these guys never seem to want to kill immediately .  they are very creative about it ;  they philosophize ,  pretend that they are playing football with your body ,  and so on .    stallone co-wrote this thing .  i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it .  i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i . q .
1	since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite .  since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it .  the setting has a lot to do with it  ( the colorado i know would be jealous )  ,  but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes .  there has not been a movie i can compare this too .  john lithgow plays a smart villain ,  but i love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting .  this is an action movie at it's best .  i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining .   you don't need 50 , 000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie .  it just has to keep you captivated ,  not shell-shocked .
1	to be honest ,  i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time .  but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater .  big mistake  !  because the #1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography .  try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system .  the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level  ( and a commercial potential )  .  the more i see it ,  the more i like it .   it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie .  this guy knows about action .  die hard 2 ,  the long kiss good bye ,  etc .  and it's particularly good in this movie .  the special effect are great and spectacular .  stallone really needed that movie get back with success .  still good to see him  !
1	in manhattan ,  the american middle class jim blandings  ( cary grant )  lives with his wife muriel  ( myrna loy )  and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and one bathroom only leased apartment .  jim works in an advertising agency raising us$ 15 , 000 . 00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space .  when he sees an advertisement of a huge house for sale in the country of connecticut for an affordable price ,  he drives with his wife and the real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice .  his best friend and lawyer bill cole  ( melvyn douglas )  sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house ,  and the man tells that he should put down the house and build another one .  jim checks the information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner he finds that he bought a  " money pit "  instead of a dream house .    " mr .  blandings builds his own house "  is an extremely funny comedy ,  with witty lines and top-notch screenplay .  cary grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the american dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice ,  while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend .  in 1986 ,  tom hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic ,   " the money pit "  .  my vote is eight .   title  ( brazil )  :   " lar ,  meu tormento "   (  " home ,  my torment "  )
1	i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3 ,  which is an almost inexistent small role .  and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad ,  even though i feared the worst .   when gabe  ( stallone )  fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top ,  he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger .  for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve ,  but than he returns .  soon after he's back ,  they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm .  at least ,  that's what the rangers believe .  in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed .  the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them .  .  .   this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever ,  but in its genre it's an enjoyable one .  i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers .  i know him best from the tv-series  " 3rd rock from the sun "  ,  but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well .  overall the acting is ok ,  it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners ,  but it also offered a very nice decor .  this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment .  i loved the snowy mountains and valleys ,  the mountain rivers and the forests .  .  .  perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind .  i give it a 6 . 5/10 .  if you don't expect too much ,  this is an enjoyable movie .
1	watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s ,  a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as  " die hard in a /on a .  "  cliffhanger is  " die hard on a mountain ,  "  and pretty good ,  for what it is .   but unlike passenger 57 and under siege ,  which are decent die hard clones on their own terms ,  cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that ,  in their immensity ,  threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks .   years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations ,  cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings .   the opening sequence has already received substantial praise ,  all of which it deserves :  its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening .  not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal ,  which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke  ( and which he repeated in deep blue sea )  ,  or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face ,  can dim the sequence's power .   the next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet .  as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin ,  the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not :  the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected .  as roger ebert has observed ,  the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition .   later ,  during the avalanche sequence ,  one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain .  so far as i know ,  no one was killed in the making of this movie  ( a small miracle ,  considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts )  ,  so obviously a dummy was used for the shot .  but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin  ( or more likely one of the second-unit directors )  knew exactly where to place the camera .   i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week ,  because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain ,  and at the same time actually feels that pain .  the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths :  he plays an older ,  more vulnerable kind of action hero ,  giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself .   in contrast to many of today's post-matrix ,  comic book-inspired action heroes ,  stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities .  in cliffhanger ,  the hero almost freezes to death ,  and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another .  he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut ,  particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains .   it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness :  when i first saw this movie as a teenager ,  i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust  ( or rather ,  the ice )  ;  at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise .   lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter ,  but he's fundamentally a good actor ,  and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue :  in one scene ,  looking at his hostages stallone and rooker ,  trying to decide which tasks to give them ,  he actually says  " you ,  stay !  you ,  fetch !  "  even a better actor ,  such as anthony hopkins ,  might have had trouble with that line .   even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside ,  it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show .   early in the movie ,  for example ,  lithgow openly says to one of his men  " retire [stallone] when he comes down .  "  no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously :  his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face ,  and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg .   lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means ,  but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor .   done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or  ( at times )  a western ,  cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film .   besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before ,  the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow ,  as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative .  finally ,  harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless ,  since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes .   it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies ,  because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later .  but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time ,  without a sequel :  there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already .  there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit :  compared to that clinker ,  cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list .   rating :  8  ( very good ,  especially considering most of stallone's other movies .  )
1	this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film !  the plot is somewhat lacking ,  but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference .  this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please .  as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining ;  and with major stars like cary grant ,  myrna loy ,  and melvyn douglas .  .  .  how could you go wrong ?    comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued ,  and is very difficult to imitate .  a good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film :  the money pit ,  with tom hanks and shelley long .  despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars ,  the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments .  achieving true comedic dialog is an art .
1	sly's best out and out action film .  it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters ,  solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured .  stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes .  this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's ,  a definite genre classic .  as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories .  plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form .  action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film .  the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner ,  michael rooker and john lithgow .  ****
1	wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge ,  an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker  ( stallone )  comes back for his girlfriend jessie  ( janine turner )  ,  while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening ,  a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing   stranded off the snowy peaks ,  and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash ,  the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit   unfortunately ,  gab and hall  ( michael rooker )  have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake ,  and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic  ( john lithgow )  , are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money   with breathtaking shots ,  vertiginous scenery ,  dizzying heights ,  perilous climbs ,  freezing temperatures ,   " cliffhanger "  is definitely stallone's best action adventure movie
1	i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin .  'die hard 2' was cool ,  and he gave the world 'cliffhanger' ,  one of the most awesome action movies ever .  that's right ,  you little punks ,  'cliffhanger' rules ,  and we all know it .   sly plays gabe walker ,  a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend ,  hal tucker  ( michael rooker )  ,  assist in a rescue on a mountain peak .  walker obviously came back at a convenient time ,  because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen  ( john lithgow )  .  qualen & co .  have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u . s .  government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back .  .  .   essentially ,  'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone .  just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains ,  complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal .  naturally ,  that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough ,  as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease ,  and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects .  after all ,  isn't that what action movies are all about ?   'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around .  a showcase of great scenes and stunts .  one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie ,  and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning ,  it maintains its action awesomeness .  john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining ,  and one bad dude .  quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever .   'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts ,  definitely renny harlin's best effort ,  and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
1	eric valette is obviously a talented film-maker ,  and so are the two guys who wrote the script .  therefore maléfique is a great flick ,  made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination .  well ,  i'm a bit exaggerating ,  but nevertheless i'm sincere .  so ,  if you like dark ,  gory movies ,  go and see this one .  it's really worth it .
1	four prisoners share a single cell :  the domineering transvestite ,  marcus  ( clovis cornillac )  ;  marcus's idiot savant buddy ,  paquerette  ( dimitri rataud )  ,  who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches ,  cockroaches ,  and his little sister ;  lassalle  ( philippe laudenbach )  ,  the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife ;  and carrère  ( gérald laroche )  ,  the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping .  after a brick falls from the wall of the cell ,  the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s .  is this journal the secret to their escape ?  or is there something much more sinister behind it ?   i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call  ( 2008 )  ,  which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen .  however ,  much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script ,  because  ( as i remember )  valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film  ( unless he chose to include the baby )  .  anyway ,  maléfique was a good way to get my respect back .   .   .  it's a french film  ( obviously something i like )  and it takes place in prison  ( which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums )  .  so that's two points for him before the film even starts .  luckily ,  valette had me once the film ended as well .  maléfique is a rather deep ,  rather complex ,  rather compelling story of obsession and desperation .   .   .  the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality .  while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense ,  the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening .  the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore .   final verdict :  8 . 5/10 .  quite a bit of respect earned back by valette .   note :  paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake  ( surprise surprise )  .  it's due out in 2009 .  i'm not sure why ,  to be honest ,  as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states .  but ,  i've been surprised before .   vive la france !    -ap3-
1	a prison cell . four prisoners-carrere , a young company director accused of fraud , 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation ,  daisy , a 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassalle , a 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wife . behind a stone slab in the cell , mysteriously pulled loose , they discovered a book : the diary of a former prisoner , danvers , who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century . the diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape .  " malefique "  is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this year . the film has a grimy , shadowy feel influenced by the works of h . p .  lovecraft , which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere . there is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed . it's a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of  " one missed call "  after his stunning debut . 9 out of 10 .
1	now ,  i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft  ( and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school ,  maybe as a separate subject )  ,  but how did they think something that sounds like  " ftagn yog sototh "  could possibly lead to any good ?   the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may ,  if read right ,  get them out .  as prisons go ,  the cell was totally unrealistic ,  so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things .  it also moves rather slowly ,  which may bore people .  but other than that ,  this is top notch horror feeling ,  mixing sartre's  " hell is other people "  with a lovecraft/barker type of story ,  and doing rather successfully .   bottom line :  take the time to watch this .  that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else .  this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it .  lessons to be learned :  yog is bad ,  almost as bad as french women .
1	i was hooked from beginning to end .  great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump ,  but to make you go  " what the f*ck did i just see ?  "  all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about ,  so i won't rehash what has already been said .  i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me .  i even had a bad dream after seeing it ,  and i am a true horror fan ,  not easily spooked by tripe like  " the grudge "  or even  " silent hill "  .  what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys .  what would my personal horror be ?  my subconscious took me there ,  and it was not pleasant .  that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you !  the best part of this movie is that it is subtle .  it's not about bogeymen that jump out at you , alien invasions ,  or tons of gore .  it's the opposite .  the horror you create in your own mind .  the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it's power over them .  simply ,  the men ask for the one thing they desire ,  and they get it .  .  . but not in the way they imagined .  so on the one hand ,  they get what they wish for from an occult book ,  but may ultimately wish they hadn't .  sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be !
1	now this is what i'd call a good horror .  with occult/supernatural undertones ,  this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene .  this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie .   the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison ,  and each of these characters  ( and their motives )  become gradually more interesting ,  as the movie builds up tension to the finale .  most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere ,  who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates .   i won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen .  there a few flaws though :  the fx are not that good ,  but they're used effectively ;  the plot leaves some mysteries open ;  and things get very confusing towards the end ,  but malefique redeems itself by the time it's over .   i thought his was a very good movie ,  8/10
1	watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it .  the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier ,  somehow without leaving his cell .  as they look through the diary ,  they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom .  what they find out ,  is something completely different ,  and horrifying to say the least .  i like low-budget horror films ,  that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way ,  and tell a good story .  this movie does just that ,  despite taking a while to get going .  the result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me ,  and i enjoyed the ride .  not a lot of gore ,  but that wouldn't fit the story ,  although the gore it has is pretty good .
1	this film centers on four criminals ,  locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell ,  hoping that a mysterious book of black magic ,  penned by a former inmate around 1920 ,  named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young .   carrère's ( gérald laroche ) criminal business tactics ( shortcuts ) have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates .  . a transsexual brute marcus ( clovis cornillac )  ,  marcus' love-toy pâquerette ( dimitri rataud ) who eats objects he touches (  .  . and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister ) and obeys his charge as if  " he "  were his mother ,  and the scholarly lassalle ( philippe laudenbach ) who doesn't read ,  or eat breakfast (  .  . the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day )  .  the film follows carrère as he reads from the book ,  attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison .  carrère loves his child ,  and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail .  when she betrays him ,  carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate ,  and longing to see and hold his beloved son .  carrère's toughest critic is marcus ,  who longs to be fully female ,  while still folding to several masculine traits ,  such as working out and taking a leak standing up .  he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic ,  although deep inside is a world of vulnerability .  pâquerette is completely under marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master .  . there's even an alarming scene where pâquerette breast-feeds from marcus !  lassalle is an unraveling mystery ,  opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain .  clearly intellectual ,  and holding possible secrets from the others ,  lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going .  soon ,  those who aren't a threat to the book seek their  " true "  escape ,  not as much from the cell of four walls ,  but the cell that imprisons their true desires .  after a certain murder ,  the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant .  . who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away ,  and better yet ,  how to use it ?  a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach .   i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film .  it does play out like  " monkey's paw "  ,  the characters get what they desire ,  but a price must be met .  there's gore in the film ,  startling moments of graphic violence ,  but ,  in my opinion ,  this is first and foremost a story-driven tale .  the gore is a product of what the book unleashes .  one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air ,  while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire .  we see danver's fate at the end ,  with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away .  lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence .  i will say that maléfique ,  through eric valette's well paced direction ,  always kept my attention ,  and ,  for being such an isolated movie (  .  . about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location ,  the prison cell ) it never seems to drag .  i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations ,  not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them .
1	in a penitentiary ,  four prisoners occupy a cell :  carrère  ( gérald laroche )  ,  who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife ;  the drag lassalle  ( philippe laudenbach )  and his protégée ,  the retarded pâquerette  ( dimitri rataud )  ,  who ate his six months sister ;  and the intellectual marcus  ( clovis cornillac )  ,  who killed his wife .  one night ,  carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell .  they realize that the book was written by danvers  ( geoffrey carey )  in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic .  they decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison ,  when they find the truth about danvers' fate .   " maléfique "  is an original ,  intriguing and claustrophobic french low-budget horror movie .  the story is practically in the same location ,  does not have any clichés and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene .  i am a great fan of french cinema ,  usually romances ,  dramas and police stories ,  but i noted that recently i have seen some good french horror movies ,  such as  " un jeu d' enfants "  ,   " belphegor "  and  " dead end "  .  my vote is seven .   title  ( brazil )  :   " sinais do mal "   (  " signs of the evil "  )
1	malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere .  nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest .  soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell .  from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison .  that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light .   honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together .  anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast .  the kills are raw and eerie .  .  .  its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser .  malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint .  at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger .  .  .  when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal ,  so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be ?  with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do .  i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale .  several elements like the visitor with the camera ,  the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story .  anyway ,  i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette ,  although its a turn-off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of  " one missed call "  which was worn off and useless already in the miike-version .
1	good horror movies from france are quite rare ,  and it's fairly easy to see why !  whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film ,  he emigrates towards glorious hollywood immediately after to directed the big-budgeted remake of another great film classic !  how can france possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy-directors leave the country after just one film ?   " haute tension "  was a fantastic movie and it earned director alexandre aja a  ( one-way ?  )  ticket to the states to remake  " the hills have eyes "   ( which he did terrifically ,  i may add )  .  eric valette's long-feature debut  " maléfique "  was a very promising and engaging horror picture too ,  and he's already off to the hollywood as well to direct the remake of takashi miike's ghost-story hit  " one missed call "  .  so there you have it ,  two very gifted frenchmen that aren't likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon .   " maléfique "  is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start ,  but once the plot properly develops ,  it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects .  the film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters .  we're inside a ramshackle french prison cell with four occupants .  the new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud ,  the elderly and  " wise "  inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there's a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome .  they find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell ,  belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920's who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape .  the four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book ,  only to realize the occult is something you shouldn't mess with eric valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists ,  which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots ,  but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of wishmaster-device .   " maléfique "  is a dark film ,  with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior .  watch it before some wealthy american production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals .
1	french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene .  maléfique preceded the revival just slightly ,  but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made !  maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget ,  but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film ,  and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner .  the plot focuses on two main ideas ;  prison and black magic .  the central character is a man named carrère ,  sent to prison for fraud .  he is put in a cell with three others ;  the quietly insane lassalle ,  body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy .  after a short while in the cell together ,  they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal .  after translating part of it ,  they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls .   black magic is a very interesting topic ,  and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it .  it's fair to say that maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints ,  the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout .  director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film ;  the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic ,  and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it's very easy to get behind them !  it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people ,  and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner ,  and this helps to ensure that maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening !  the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot ;  the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done .  anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying !  overall ,  maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - highly recommended viewing !
1	maléfique is a very interesting movie .  it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures .  the central concept is great ,  three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth  ( who the audience identify with )  and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell .   the atmosphere is well-woven ,  it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes' in the château d'if  ( prior to becoming the count of monte cristo )  .  the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell ,  particularly the character we are meant to identify with  ( carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified ,  but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud )  .  on one occasion carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him ;  we never leave the cell ,  the claustrophobia is unbroken .  there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell ,  and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall .  so even though the film appears to be very modern ,  it has a very old world feel of incarceration .   the characters are intriguing .  we have marcus ,  a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pâquerette  ( french for daisy )  a heavily retarded young man .  pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful ,  and unfortunately this included his baby sister ,  hence his current predicament  ( i like this comment on internalisation ,  very primitive )  .  lasalle is a withdrawn ,  possessed elderly man ,  in for brutally murdering his wife .   the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you ,  and there's a ritual that goes with that .  i think that's what disturbs me the most ,  seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically .  it has a real life ring to it .  the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well ,  every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong .  i'm actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self-destructive .   i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently ,  particularly with carrère ,  also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film ,  not in terms of a successive revelation either .  i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish ,  more by design than execution ,  such as the famous  " vagina eye "  ,  and the sodomy of lasalle ,  for me ,  totally hollow images .   at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with ,  and some things don't seem logical ,  for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about carrère's child .  this doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird ,  a  " pure "  horror movie .  there is no comedic dross or genre segueing ,  like cube  ( 1997/natali )  ,  the obvious movie to compare it to ,  it's a total immersion experience ,  where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters .  this last comment i make about it being a  " pure "  experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point .   on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian .  he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him .  the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge .  this prompts lasalle to go insane .  that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge .  it's something i myself have felt .   one final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters' names .  to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character ,  simply click on philippe laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936 .
1	i'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england ,  but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it .  there are a lot of great things to the film ,  for a start the acting .  its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work .  this and the constantly gripping and interesting script ,  with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it ,  give the film a real solid backbone .  add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner .  it has my favorite kind of gore too ,  supernatural and splattery .  also ,  the characters of marcus ,  the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy ,  his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times ,  and give a far out ,  anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones .  this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies ,  far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce .  my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone ,  but it still works ,  so on the whole i'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs .
1	i didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless .    it is original ,  although reminded me a little of two other french films ,  vidocq and city of lost children ,  mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters .   set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off ,  this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster .   always interesting ,  with the perennial 'black arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable !    scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing .
1	the film opens with bill coles  ( melvyn douglas )  telling a story about how his best friend--make that client--jim blandings  ( cary grant )  and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment ,  with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms .  when jim's wife ,  muriel  ( myrna loy )  ,  wants to renovate the apartment ,  advertising exec jim falls in love with  ( or falls for !  )  an ad for a house .  once he's purchased the house ,  bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim's 'dream house' goes wrong .   one of three collaborations between grant and loy ,  this is a charming little comedy--not very taxing ,  with no real great message ,  but a great way to spend an hour or two .  the laughs are there right from the start ,  when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off ,  only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel .  the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros ,  and that's just what grant and loy give us :  polished performances ,  simple chemistry ,  and a lot of fun .  myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role  ( it's evident that grant's character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting ,  and grant ,  as always ,  pulls both off with remarkable aplomb )  ,  but she gives muriel a colour ,  life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character .  melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well ,  never hitting a single wrong note .   one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the 'store room' ,  and jim goes to 'save' him .  .  .  only to get everyone trapped inside !  every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'wham'--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch .  8/10
1	if you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'book of the dead' ,  'book of eibon' or 'necronomicon' ,  then you should feel right at home with malefique ,  a film which also features an occult tome ,  one with the power to change the destinies of all involved .  discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell ,  the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers ,  a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s ;  a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished .  finders of the book are carrère  ( gérald laroche )  a company embezzler shopped by his wife ,  lassalle  ( philippe laudenbach )  who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan ,  the halfwit pâquerette  ( dimitri rataud )  who once ate his baby sister ,  and the 'librarian' marcus  ( clovis cornillac )  ,  supposedly driven mad by reading ,  who murdered his wife .  reminding the viewer of meat loaf's equally bizarre ,  bosomy male in fight club  ( 1999 )  ,  lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet ,  one who is especially protective of the infantile pâquerette .  with the coming of the book however ,  and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents ,  marcus assumes greater and greater significance .  at first assured of an early bail ,  meanwhile carrère takes little more than academic interest in events .  suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and ,  as the prisoners experiment ,  danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers .  .  .   staged for the most part within a prison cell ,  and between four or five characters ,  malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter  ( as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers )  .  only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell ,  a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed ,  closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere .  more than anything ,  this is a film about being trapped ,  either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding .   " i'm going to escape ,  "  says carrère at the start of the film ,  wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son .  whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price ,  and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine .   with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director eric vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does .  as critics have noticed ,  it is a film with strong freudian overtones - lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance ;  the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye ;  the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus ;  danvers' original placenta fetish ;  the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited ,  etc .  with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong ,  and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what ,  when one comes down to it ,  is just a matter of four guys ,  four bunks ,  one folding table and a book .  there's a genuine ,  growing ,  lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages ,  while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina ,  or what ultimately happens to pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable .  the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate ,  rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions :  a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore .  perhaps this is a particularly european manner ,  as one recalls a similar ,  measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven's the fourth man  ( 1983 )  - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye .   lensed well in 1 . 85 : 1 ,  malefique benefits from excellent performances and ,  if for this viewer at least ,  the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been ,  the journey to the final shot was worth taking .  coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received haute tension  ( aka :  switchblade romance ,  2003 )  ,  this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry ,  this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia
1	well ,  magic works in mysterious ways .  this movie about 4 prisoners ,  trying to escape with the help of spells ,  written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense .  even if it had something of a theater-play  ( almost everything happens in the cell )  it never got boring and it was acted very well .  in the tradition of  " cube "  you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal ,  you developed some sympathy with some of them ,  only to change your mind by the twists the story takes .  some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air .  altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything  ( a friend rented it )  ,  it was a positive surprise !
1	" maléfique "  is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart .  its cast doesn't have recognized names ,  it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect ;  but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script ,  an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills .  eric valette may not be a well-know name yet ,  but with  " maléfique "  ,  his feature length debut ,  he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet ,  gans or aja .   the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell ,  four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal :  to get out .  carrère  ( gérald laroche )  gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud ;  his cell-mates ,  the violent marcus  ( clovis cornillac )  ,  the intellectual lassalle  ( philippe laudenbach )  and the mentally challenged pâquerette  ( dimitri rataud )  ,  are all convicted for murder and give carrère a cold welcome .  their personalities will clash as carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic .   written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier ,   " maléfique "  is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker's stories .  the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters ,  they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities .  the story's supernatural element is very well-handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel .  despite being a movie about four men locked in a room ,  the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact ,  the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust ,  claustrophobia ,  and specially ,  paranoia .   director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere ,  mood and his cast to give life to the plot .  despite its obvious lack of budget ,  he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original ,  fresh and very attractive .  his subtle and effective camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location ,  and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot .  the very few displays of special effects are very well-done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore .   the characters are what make this film work ,  and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit .  gérald laroche is excellent as carrère ,  a man at first sight innocent ,  but who hides a dark past .  philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too ,  specially rataud in his very demanding role .  however ,  is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus ,  a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself .  the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them .   the movie is terrific ,  but it is not without its share of flaws .  of course ,  the most notorious one is its the low-budget .  some of the cgi-effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make-up and prosthetics used in other scenes ,  however ,  it is never too bad for it .  probably the bad thing about  " maléfique "  is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters ,  not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view .   anyways ,   " maléfique "  is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately ,  and one that deserves to have more recognition .  valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest  ( albeit complex )  tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities .  personally ,  this film is a new favorite .  8/10
1	when i was six yo ,  i learned about a series called  " los campeones "  ,  and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch  " the champions "  and  " the avengers "  once every week .  i think that was the golden age of english series .  .  .   ( i already own the complete cycle of  " the prisoner "  !  )  but lasted also a few years later with  " the tomorrow people "  ,   " the worst witch "   ( i just me ,  or this is  " harry potter "  in girl ,  of course ,  before as much as i want  " the campions "  to be in zone 1 or zone 4 ,  i'm also waiting for  " dr .  who "   ( pack the whole series in a set of ,  uhm ,  maybe 300 dvd's ,  please ,  i couldn't expend more for it ,  8 )  ,   " people of tomorrow "  ,  and several other 'low budget' ,  but great stories to be available within my reached zones .  i speak and understand english ,  but not all my relatives do ,  including my parents ,  whom introduced me into these great stories .  .  .  i hope someday ,  someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them .  .  .  dubbed or subtitled ,  but in the same format i saw them .  remember ,  zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set !
1	i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history .  .  .  .  .  . i was hooked .  the premise was pretty simple ;  two hardened nemesis agents ,  richard barrett and craig stirling  (  william gaunt and stuart damon )  are partnered up with an expert  ( if not young )  doctor and biologist  ( sharron macready )  to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china .  whilst making their escape ,  their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio ,  thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come .  .  .   the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived ,  one season run that has set it up for cult status .   monty berman ,  the producer ,  was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as  " happening "   (  a studio deputising for the australian outback )  and the 'snow' sets of  " operation deep freeze "  and  " the beginning "  but if you can get past this ,  and focus on the characters and the story lines ,  the show was really a lot of fun .  it had a great mix of adventure ,  and plenty of deadpan humour  ( mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt )  .   the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show  ( and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig !  !  )  .  they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine .  i have to say ,  i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross ,  and those eyes .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv .  i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since .  however ,  craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too .   the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with ,  including donald sutherland ,  jeremy brett ,  peter wyngarde ,  burt kwouk ,  anton rodgers ,  kate o'mara ,  jenny linden ,  paul eddington and colin blakely .   notable episodes for me were  :   " auto kill "  ,   " the interrogation "  ,   " the fanatics "  ,   " the mission "  and  " the gilded cage "  but i am sure every one has their personal favourites .   if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time ,  or to re watch it after many years ,  remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it .   enjoy !
1	my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's .  we absolutely adored it .  there was something so exotic and mysterious about it ,  especially when compared to the usual american re-runs  ( petticoat junction ,  green acres .  .  .  you get the idea )  .  it had a similar feel to the avengers  ( not too much of a surprise ,  since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre )  .   i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up .  i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it ,  so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence .  but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it .  hopefully it will find a new generation of fans .
1	well ,  what can i say ,  other than these people are super in every way .  i quite like sharon mcreedy ,  i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes ,  i did not realise that they had made so many ,  i also think that it is a great shame ,  that they have not made any more .  i wish that i got given these powers ,  imagine me ,  being knocked off my cycle ,  somewhere and being knocked out cold ,  then waking up in a special hospital .  later on ,  i discover that my body has been enhanced .  just like richard barrat .  these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way ,  you cannot fight these 3 people ,  as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry .  the music is well written ,  and to me ,  puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind ,  the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats ,  improved sight ,  improved hearing and touch .  and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon .  who i thought was beautiful and intelligent .  when i was a boy ,  i had a huge crush on her !  !  !  !  now i can see why ,  on my dvd set .  the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series .  i also thought that trymane was a good boss ,  firm but he got things done !
1	monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this ,  a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man' .  it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster ,  and i enjoy watching it still .  stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett ,  while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready .  the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne .  by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson ,  terry nation and brian clemens ,  while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner' .  i regret that there was never a second series ;  the concept had so much life left in it .  would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections ?  what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers ?  did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw ?  we never found out ,  alas .
1	i was 10 years old when this show was on tv .  by far it was my favorite .  the actors were very credible .  alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous .  .  .  .  i just order the dvd  ( 15 episodes )  .  they didn't have super-powers .  they just had superior human skills  ( strength ,  hearing ,  sight )  .  the 3 actors were very good in their rolls ,  very believable .  there was a good story in each episode .  at the time ,  there were no special effects or explosions everywhere ,  so the script was suppose to be good ,  and the characters performs were great .  there was no fancy stuff ,  like in other shows .  they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show .  i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff .
1	i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen .  it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation .  the thought that maybe they won't get together .  .  .  it is an indie film after all .  this movie was well written ,  directed and acted .  the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent .
1	manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences .  the worst one is the lack of closet space !  some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full !   melvin frank and norman panama ,  a great comedy writing team from that era ,  saw the potential in eric hodgins novel ,  whose hero ,  jim blandings ,  can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel ,  and two daughters ,  must share .   jim blandings ,  a madison ave .  executive ,  has had it !  when he sees an ad for connecticut living ,  he decides to take a look .  obviously ,  a first time owner ,  jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent .  this is only the beginning of his problems .   whatever could be wrong ,  goes wrong .  the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house ,  after the original one is razed .  as one problem leads to another ,  more money is necessary ,  and whatever was going to be the original cost ,  ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford .   the film is fun because of the three principals in it .  cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings .  myrna loy ,  was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr .  grant .  the third character ,  bill cole ,  an old boyfriend of myrna ,  turned lawyer for the blandings ,  is suave and debonair ,  the way melvin douglas portrayed him .  one of the blandings girls ,  joan ,  is played by sharyn moffett ,  who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint .  the great louise beavers plays gussie ,  but doesn't have much to do .   the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe ,  who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better .  the direction of h . c .  potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies .
1	the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's  " i'll take you there "  is not overt ,  but clearly has ties to his work  ( shelly has acted in two of hartley's films )  .  not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative ,  but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light .  though this film is not ironic on the whole  ( thank god )  ,  the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss .  with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies ,   " i'll see you there "  is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion .   the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces .  not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home ,  but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat .  all washed up ,  bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy  ( played by the director adrienne shelly )  brings him all kinds of surprises :  a self-help book and a  " date "  for her traumatized brother .   the unwilling bill tries to refuse ,  but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice .  no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to  " rebound "  with her .  however ,  her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date .  and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him ,  forcing herself upon him .  to what end ,  we are not aware .  .  .  except for maybe the fact that she is psycho .   ( and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy ?  )   aware that bill desperately wants to see rose ,  bernice offers her car ,  but on the condition that he take her somewhere first .  on the way ,  she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun  ( a pinkerton detective ,  no less )  .  an imbroglio of angst ,  resentment ,  redemption ,  passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose .  .  .  of course ,  with a few stops along the way .
1	this movie is wonderful .  the writing ,  directing ,  acting all are fantastic .  very witty and clever script .  quality performances by actors ,  ally sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky .  really original and heart-warmingly unpredicatable .  the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production .
1	i too have gone thru very painful personal loss  ( twice )  and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well ,  life out of balance ,  nothing makes sense ,  well meaning relatives ,  etc .  .  .   it was nice to see ally again .  she is one of my all time favorite movie actors .   i laughed and cried as the story unfolded .  great story and cast .  well done !
1	real cool ,  smart movie .  i loved sheedy's colors ,  especially the purple car .  alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella .  i liked sheedy's reference to how her face had gotten fatter .  the roadside dance scene is brilliant .  really liked this one .
1	i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne's  " waitress "   ( 2007 )  .  this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie .  adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director ,  an original and unique artist .  she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency .  ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge .  male lead reg rodgers ,  looking like judd nelson ,  is fine .  there is also a great cameo by ben vereen .  the song at the end of the movie  " the bastard song "  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy :     " it's a world of suffering ,   in a sea of pain ,   no matter how much sun you bring ,   you're pummeled by the rain .  .  .   don't let the heartless get you down ,   don't greet the heartless at your door ,   don't live among the heartless "
1	" i'll take you there "  tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date .  unlike most romantic comedies ,  this little indie is mostly tongue-in-cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance .  a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving ,  stays fresh ,  and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers .
1	this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail .  there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one .  this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film .  at first ,  the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves ,  even if grudgingly ,  through each other .  rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them .  you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread .  hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .
1	for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and  ( i guessed )  all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies .   this film was a real surprise :  despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces ,  the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we ,  the viewer ,  got back was almost true suspension of belief .  when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police ,  you almost believed it was possible .   if you are a fan of some of the better sex farces  ( canadian or not )  you should definitely seek this one out .  and the big surprise ,  this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity .
1	at the end of the movie i still don't know whether i liked it or not .  so was the case with most of the reviewers .  but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in .    long ago i read a quote :  there are 2 kind of writers ,  1 .  those who think and write .  and 2 .  those write and make the readers think .  while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience .   i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club .  .  .  .   it is definitely a classic :  something which no one understands but appreciates .  .  .  .   what i don't understand :  why stathom ( jake green )  had a blackout  ( thats how it all began )  ,  all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one .   well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about :  i'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not :  then answer this first .  .  .  .  when you come across a puzzle labeled as 'no one has ever solved' would you like to try ?    i would
1	aside from a few titles and the new sherlock holmes movie ,  i think i've watched every movie guy ritchie has directed .  twice .  needless to say ,  i'm a big fan and revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why .  this movie is a very different approach from ritchie ,  when you look at it comparatively with lock ,  stock .  .  .  and snatch .  revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn't expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn't know he needed .  along with seeing andré benjamin of outkast fame strut his acting ability ,  other standout acts are ray liotta playing the maniacal mr .  d/macha and mark strong playing sorter ,  the hit-man .   after being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner ,  macha ,  jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent .  when he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from macha ,  jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that's left him with three days to live .  a team of loan sharks ,  however ,  have an answer for him and a ticket to life- only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them ,  all in a ploy to both take macha down and show jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself .  along with having the air of death loom ,  and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money ,  jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him ,  which introduces sorter - a hit-man under macha's employ .  the depth with the story comes when jake realizes that some co- convicts he spent time with in solitary may very-well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that jake seems to find his way into .  when faced with this reality though ,  zack  ( vincent pastore )  and avi show jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary ,  having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to jake .  the movie unravels to a humbling process for both jake and macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons .   the style of the movie is top-notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes .  although a lot of nods at ritchie's previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue ,  the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre .  it's also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should .  the characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and ,  true to ritchie fashion ,  they're all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone's affairs .  i could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but i don't want to take too much away from it if you haven't seen it yet .   it may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it's a great movie and it should be seen .  if you're lucky and you haven't seen the watered-down us release ,  see if you can get the original uk version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take .  i saw it with my crew around early-2006 and we're still talking about it with little things we've picked up on today .  it has garnered its cult status ,  and it's well- deserved as the film where ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit .   standout line :   " fear or revere me ,  but please ,  think i'm special .  we share an addiction .  we're approval junkies .  "
1	if you are a fan of altman's large ensemble casts ,  as evidenced in major films like m . a . s . h .  ,  nashville ,  gosford park ,  and lesser seen films like a wedding ,  then you will no doubt be entertained by health .  centered around a health convention where two women are running for president ,  health contains many of altman's latter 70s regulars like paul dooley  ( who helped write the film )  ,  carol burnett ,  and henry gibson ,  while also including top star altman newcomers like lauren bacall ,  james garner ,  and glenda jackson .  like a lot of altman ensemble films there are numerous subplots in this film ,  but it is not nearly as overwhelming as films like nashville or a wedding ,  rather it has a more centered feel ,  perhaps like m . a . s . h .  or gosford park .  the whole thing is an obvious satire on the health movement ,  filled with over-top ,  outlandish ,  contradictive characters ,  with guest stars like dick cavett providing a wry commentary on the whole thing .  underlining the whole election process is altman's characteristic pessimism about politics and public appeal but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun most people seem to be having .  this would be one of altman's last films like this for a while !
1	" ah ritchie's made another gangster film with statham "  thought the average fan ,  expecting another snatch/lock stock ;  expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts ,  but none too hard for  " me and the lads "  to swallow after a few beers .   ah ,  pay attention ,  you do need to watch this film .  no cups of tea ,  no extra diet cokes from the counter ,  no  " keep it running "  shouts as you nip to the fridge - watch the film !  no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence  ( and if that floats your boat ,  so be it )  but sharp solid direction ,  excellent dialogue ,  and great performances .   my favourite - big pussy from the sopranos ,  always a reliable hood .
1	i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art .  i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5 . 2 .   not only does guy bring together a b list ( ish )  movie cast and make them into such glorious characters ,  he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination .   far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate .  .  . yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable .   this film is special .  get it ,  now !
1	in the classic sense of the four humors  ( which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment )  ,  altman's  " h . e . a . l . t . h .  "  treats all of the humors ,  and actually in very funny ,  entertaining ways .  there's the phlegm ,  as personified by lauren bacall's very slow ,  guarded ,  and protective character esther brill ,  who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance ,  protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being .  there's paul dooley's choleric dr .  gil gainey ,  who like a fish out of water  ( perhaps more like a seal )  flops around frenetically ,  barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness .  the melancholy of glenda jackson's isabella garnell smacks of shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous hamlet -- even proffering a soliloquy or two .  and let's not forget henry gibson's bile character ,  bobby hammer  (  " the breast that feeds the baby rules the world "  )  .  then there's the characters harry wolff and gloria burbank  ( james garner and carol burnett ,  respectively )  ,  relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for h . e . a . l . t . h .  -- a kind of world trade organization specializing in h . e . a . l . t . h .  ,  which is to say anything but health .  this is altman at his classic best .
1	i'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever .  absolutely smashed ,  stunned and dazed by the whole picture ,  marvellous playing of jason statham ,  ray liotta and all the crew ,  amazing plot .  .  .  just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul ,  because it's strange ,  but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for .  .  .  the very best ,  mr .  ritchie !  the very best ever .  those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed .  but there are lots of shallow movies in hollywood nowadays ,  you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it .  on the contrary ,  revolver is unique ,  i could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself ,  of everyone who was to watch it .  absolutely unsurpassed ,  astounding ,  dazzling .  .  .  one can get insight watching this ,  i have no doubt about that .  actually ,  no words can express my admiration .  .  .  i'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy hollywood rubbish we had been watching .  thank you from all heart ,  it's simply the best .
1	it's all very simple .  jake goes to prison ,  and spends five years with the con and the chess masters .  they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure ,  and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks .  they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom :  from his innermost fears ,  from what he believes to be himself .  for that ,  they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear ,  all the pride ,  all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will .   it's a clever movie about the journey of illumination ,  about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves .  10/10 ,  no doubt .
1	i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life .  believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all-time classic .  i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock ,  stock .  .  .  .  and snatch ,  but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed .  i absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again .  this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films ,  and also a lot better .  i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie .  i believe he has taken movie-making to another level  (  i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film ,  but i believe time will prove me right  )  .  this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together .  i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film  (  some answers from endless hours of thinking ,  some answers from reading other people's take on the film  ) and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again .  i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been .
1	neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist ,  revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers .  but then ,  nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew ,  especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework .  as might be expected from luc besson's name on the credits as producer ,  there's a definite element of 'cinema de look' about it :  set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap ,  it looks great ,  has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style ,  all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment .  but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck ,  and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life ,  the universe and everything .  if anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences  ( a bit of machiavelli ,  a dash of godard ,  a lot of the principles of chess )  ,  motifs and techniques ,  littering the screen with quotes :  the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims ,  and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie .  rather than a commercial for kabbalism ,  it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce ,  chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central  ( somewhat metaphysical )  con .   the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy  ( literally )  within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger ,  but it's got a lot going for it all the same .  not worth starting a new religion over ,  but i'm surprised it didn't get a us distributor .  maybe they found ray liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?
1	having read the reviews for this film ,  i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good .  however ,  this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time .  the majority of reviews that i had read ,  said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow .  and whilst some parts do leave you confused ,  the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much .  it's not like  " lock ,  stock .  .  .  "  or  " snatch "  ,  in the sense that it isn't that funny  ( in fact ,  it's pretty dark )  ,  and it is a lot more intelligent ,  in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints  ( and ,  in one of the best scenes of the film ,  jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself )  .  the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned ,  is that it is full of memorable characters ,  specifically statham ,  who gives a fantastic performance as the lead ,  and ray liotta ,  who spends most of the film in speedos ,  but gives a great performance none the less .  if you've got time ,  and have time afterwards to think about the film ,  and even watch it again ,  you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film .  i think it's fantastic ,  and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game .
1	i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone !  the fact is it wasn't what anyone was expecting ,  especially from guy ritchie .  what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners  " do ya like dags ?  "  etc ,  but this is far more mature than his previous works .  i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder ,  this film demands all your attention !  look past the cool and dazzling look of the film ,  try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film .   yes this has its influences from modern classics (  fight club ,  pulp fiction etc  )  but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none .  i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney  " masterpieces "  .
1	first of all ,  don't go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock ,  this is a different sort of gangster film .   i saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience .  it's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that ?  that was awful ,  and the other half will leave thinking what was that ?  that was cool .  personally i like films that i don't understand ,  i . e . mullholland drive ,  and usual suspects ,  so i enjoyed revolver .    it definitely wasn't perfect though .  i saw the big twist coming a mile away ,  at least part of it ,  and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good ,  revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed .  also some scenes ,  like the animation ,  and the scene where sorter goes on a killing spree ( actually one of my favourites )  ,  although ,  awesome scenes to watch ,  seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch ,  not because they fit in with the movie .   however there were many good things too .  i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors ,  jason stratham ,  ray liotta ,  vincent pastore ,  and even andre benjamin ( who was a pleasant surprise )  .  this movie definitely kept my interest ,  with one great ,  suspenseful ,  action packed ,  scene after another .  when ray liotta was being held under the table wow .  .  .  . well you have to see it .  the script was extremely well done ,  and the soundtrack ,  as with most guy ritchie films ,  was great .   though a step below such movies as , fight club ,  mullholland drive ,  and usual suspects ,  it was still an awesome fast paced ,  psychological ,  action movie ,  with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over .
1	i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away .  it is a real masterpiece of art and i don't understand why most of the people think it's garbage .  the main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power !  this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way .   " the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look "  - do you remember this from the movie ?  because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego .  .  .  that voice that always tells us that we are important ,  that gives us our pride ,  that tells us not to give ,  but only to take ,  that creates our aggression ,  that wants to be in control ,  that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts .  gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance .  a superb movie !
1	i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think ,  and don't just drip-feed the answers to their audience .   " revolver "  is one of these films ,  and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow ,  with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it .  first time .  true ,  it doesn't compare to other mind-mucks like  " the usual suspects "  or  " memento "  ,  but in its own right its an intelligent and thought-provoking film .    another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is .  every scene ,  every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages .  if you see it you'll know what i mean .   so ,  to conclude .  .  .  watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it .  if not ,  well ,  no-one ever said  " revolver "  is for everyone .  and that's my 2 cents .
1	first of all ,  when people hear 'guy ritchie' ,  they immediately think of snatch .  yes ,  snatch was a good movie ,  but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch .  they don't expect him to explore new frontiers .  this movie revolver is different than snatch ;  it's much darker and is very complex .  the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything .  so this movie toys with your head .  it's very cleverly written .   this movie is different than snatch .  it was done wonderfully ,  the cinematography is beautiful ,  and you can recognize guy ritchie's personal touch  ( style of directing )  in it .   what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers .
1	ok .  .  .  this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike  ( although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film-makers ,  and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics )  so i wanted to sit in guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it .   the film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is .  this has been described many times as as making the film  " inaccessible "  to the viewer .  the film's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle  ( or not so subtle )  hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory ,  ie .  ray liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words  " fear me "  is portrayed as both tragically pathetic  ( from statham's pov )  or interrogating and bold  ( from liotta's pov )  .  this is but one example of ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with revolver ,  we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal  ( the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption .  .  .  i mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys ,  all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs )  but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points .   take the scene where jason statham's character runs afoul of a car .  this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever .  .  .  but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death .   so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling ,  i'd be taking the p*ss if i said i didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going  " uh .  .  .  wtf ?  "  .  .  .  but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art .  it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand .  and even easier to say  " well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film !  "  .  in my humble opinion ,  revolver is a stylish ,  complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers .  if we choose this opportunity to collectively say  " ah sh*t ,  i wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in-nit loll .  .  .  guy ritchie is a tit !  "  then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow ,  crappy people .  just because guy made a name for himself with funny ,  cheeky cockney romps ,  doesn't mean he can't be deep without being  " pretentious "  .  funny people can be thoughtful too .
1	i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid ,  and ,  naturally ,  was moved to tears by this story of a fox family .  the fantastic scenery at hokkaidô ,  the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists .  i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack .  to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa-dubbing is the only one worth listening to .  i taped both  ( defa and br )  but i keep viewing the first one only .
1	glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made .   the film makes you care about each member of this fox family ,  from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic .  set against an inhospitable countryside ,  the audience's hearts warm to the family members .   the music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms .   man remains one of the biggest predators ,  but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living ,  not just surviving beyond human endeavours .
1	i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old - i bugged my parents to take me back three times .  i began looking for it on video about five years ago ,  finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site ,  but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased  ( i understand the original video run was small )  ,  or have the rights purchased by the family channel ,  disney ,  etc .  and shown regularly .  it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan ,  narrated by a wise old tree .  the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well .  it would be a good seller today ,  better than many of the weak offerings to children's movies today .
1	i have been looking for this movie for so many years .  i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie .  i called disney all the movie stores and the net .  no luck .  what a waste it was a very good movie .  it will be missed :  (
1	i saw this movie when i was little - it was called  " glacier fox "  .  i was totally traumatized by it !  it follows a cute little fox family around .  the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes .  i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics .  i won't tell you what happened ,  but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the foxes .  i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die .  oh man .  this movie made me cry for hours .  it was a good movie .  .  . i think - i was really little and truth be told -all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die .  rent it if you can ,  but don't show your kids !
1	i recommend families if possible , to show this to older children only . some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . now that thats out of the way , let me explain about this movie . this is in reality a documentary of a male fox , who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score , is breath taking . you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible , it'll get ugly later . they gave both the fox and the vixen names , but i can't remember what they are for the likes of me . he fights off this invading male , to win her love . they later on create a den , and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs ; one of which is blind . there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family , but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . the first victim is the blind pup , who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . the second victim is the mother , who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . she unknowingly walks into a foot trap . while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot , causing her to bleed to death . the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . the male is now a single dad , forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . it later proves not to be enough , when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own ;  thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . i won't spoil the surprising ending for you , but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early 1980s ,  when we had a thing called showbiz cable . i was only 4 when i saw it , but i could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it . now i know why , after i secretly watched it when it came on disney , when i was 9 . i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . i was moved to tears . but as dark and ugly as it was , it serves a purpose . to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals , and why they are endangered . this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species , and i hoped it worked . its not fake like the true life nature films by disney , they don't teach about why animals are going extinct . the encroachment of land , the killing off of the foxes main prey , and senseless killing of these beautiful animals ; has resulted in them becoming endangered . i wish they would make sequel to this movie ,  ( glacier fox 2005 ) to see if they're being treated better . maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up . this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes , especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . the surviving parent takes on the roll of both , and tries to teach the important lessons of life . it isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults , especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . best all around soundtrack and musical score i've ever heard .
1	some of the acknowledged altman  " masterpieces "  seem sadder to me now .  maybe it's me .  like the last reviewer ,  i even like this  " lesser "  altman  ( shown recently on fmc )  ,  although i don't think he was aiming at a wide audience .  organization politics as a  " microcosm "  for public campaigns .  some of this satirical  " docudrama "  is now dated ,  like dick cavett watching the tonight show ,  but i found much of the dialog funny and insightful  ( e . g .   " you are for real .  that means you're no threat to anyone "  )  .  the story isn't  " profound ,  "  but i liked it .  and the performances are funny ,  especially cavett  ( as  " himself "  )  ,  lauren bacall as an aging conservative figurehead ,  glenda jackson  ( who actually became a member of parliament )  as a left wing ideologue  ( in the opening scene lecturing someone dressed as a carrot on the sanctity of politics )  ,  and carol burnett as a basket case .  all in the inimitable altman style ,  although maybe not quite as inimitable as usual .  but pretty inimitable .
1	the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing ,  that is what i guess makes him so mean .  i don't think most men will like this movie ,  especially if they ever cheated on their wife .  this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end .  but then ,  there you have it ,  a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say ,   " hokie as hell .  "  a pretty good movie until the end .  ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning .  and then there is the aftermath of what happened .  guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending .  i'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end .
1	this film made john glover a star .  alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film .  and i mean that sport .
1	successful self-made married businessman harry mitchell  ( a superbly steely performance by roy scheider )  has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper cini  ( the gorgeous kelly preston )  .  harry's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods -- sleazy porno theater manager raimy  ( a splendidly slimy john glover )  ,  antsy strip joint owner leo  ( well played by robert trebor )  and crazed pimp bobby shy  ( a frightfully intense clarence williams iii )  -- who have videotaped his affair with cini .  when harry refuses to pay up ,  the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it .  this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods .  director john frankenheimer ,  adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard's gritty crime thriller novel ,  expertly maintains a steady snappy pace ,  delivers plenty of gripping tension ,  and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere .  the leads are all uniformly excellent ,  with stand-out supporting turns by ann-margret as harry's bitter neglected wife barbara ,  vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen ,  and lonny chapman as harry's loyal business partner jim o'boyle .  the tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout .  the wickedly profane dialogue ,  jost vacano's glossy cinematography ,  gary chang's stirring score ,  the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well .  as an added bonus ,  both vanity and preston take their clothes off .  a very strong and satisfying little number that's well worth checking out .
1	life's going not to badly for harry mitchell ,  he's an ex-air force major  ( plus nifty little pension i imagine )  ,  who's raking in the cash for a patent he's developed  ( fusing titanium and steel via explosive process ,  creating super metal fit for nasa )  ,  and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick .  he's got a nice little pad in la .  i like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream ,  and you get a good slice here ,  what with the restored silver jag  ( a series 1 e-type roadster )  for him ,  and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her  ( as well as i'm sure other trinkets and boys toys )  .  there's always got to be more though hasn't there ?  so harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans  ( you're only as old as the woman you're feeling )  .  as in many films noir ,  one mistake ,  in an otherwise blotch-less life ,  leads to a downwards arc for harry .   three blackmailers leech onto him .  these are where the value are for me ,  great character actors playing very believable roles .  bobby shy  ( played by clarence williams iii )  is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers .  he's reminiscent of pluto ,  the vicious black ex-con psychopath from carl franklin's well-regarded neo-noir  " one false move "   ( 1992 )  .  there's a similar character motivation i believe .  both men have had enough of the man ,  and well pretty much everyone ,  in extremis .  robert trebor plays leo franks ,  a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour ,  and $50 for a whole hour  ( did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount ?  )  .  he's in over his head ,  and it's great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat ,  believable breakdown .  john glover wins as alan raimy ,  who is the brains of the plot ,  an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui .  he's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie ,  including what i believe is a pretty well-implied rape  ( pay attention to his rap sheet readout ,  it's easily missed ,  and read between the lines for the motel scene with  " slim "  )  .   in common with one false move ,  though not exclusively ,  i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence .   so far so good but i think there's a real problem with the film .  harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his  " tit in the wringer "  .  my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider .  roy scheider protagonists never lose ,  they're self-sure and smooth ,  but not in an annoying way .  i feel i'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril ,  the movie relies on this for dramatic tension ;  however i didn't believe it .  for me it's like being asked to believe that sandra bullock's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama ,  or stephen seagal's character is going to get taken down by the baddies  ( did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value )  .  roy scheider doesn't convince as an adulterer either ,  you don't feel any annoyance with him at all ,  his character is teflon-coated .   it also felt like a movie that took some cuts .  at 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped :  harry's wife ,  ann margaret ,  is pretty much a cardboard cutout ,  an extension of harry ,  her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention .  the effect that the affair has on harry's marriage isn't properly communicated .  this could be a frankenheimer problem ,  he's not known for character development .  i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs .    there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film ,  but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better  ( no disrespect to the great roy scheider )  .  the film felt short ,  even with the long running time ,  and i think could have taken some more fleshing out .   but you really can't forget the sleaze ,  like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour .
1	52-pick up never got the respect it should have .  it works on many levels ,  and has a complicated but followable plot .  the actors involved give some of their finest performances .  ann-margret ,  roy scheider ,  and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals .  notable too are vanity ,  who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows ,  and kelly preston ,  who's character will haunt you for a few days .  anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .
1	this is a great  " small "  film .  i say  " small "  because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions ,  as in a john woo film .  great performances by roy scheider and the three  " bad guys "  .  john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days .  the film is very easy to watch ,  the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around ,  it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens .  wonderful ending ,  very positive .  i never read the elmore leonard book ,  but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie .
1	this slick and gritty film consistently delivers .  it's one of frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date  ( and if you are scratching your head thinking  " but i loved get shorty "  you need to be punched in the face )  .  in my opinion ,  no one captures the  " feel "  for leonard's characters better then john glover in 52 pick-up .  the relocation of the story from detroit  ( novel )  to hollywood  ( film )  elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights .  be a man ,  have a few beers and watch this movie .  for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are :  swag ,  rum punch ,  cat chaser ,  city primeval ,  and 52 pick-up .  my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate .  i also have a real special place in my cold ,  movie heart for dead bang and black sunday .
1	i've always liked this john frankenheimer film .  good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of frankenheimer .  his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference ,  he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant !  you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made .  i've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance .  clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out .  frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail ,  murder ,  sex ,  drugs ,  and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts .  what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped ?  a guilty pleasure to say the least .  vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance .  a classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten .
1	based on elmore leonard ,  this is a violent and intelligent action film .  the story :  a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals .  roy schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit's got to go to john glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath .  i must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film .  also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are kelly preston as the young bate for schieder's character .  vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers .  i'm glad to say that ann-margaret still hasn't lost it - this lady is a true babe .  don't look at the rate of this film .  i really don't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film .  you will enjoy it ,  that's a promise .  recommended a+ .
1	spoilers !   from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10 : 00 news ,  i wanted to see it .  i don't remember who it was ,  or which local omaha newscast carried the review ,  but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going nebraskan .  they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann-margret when she's swimming in the pool .  glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth ,  using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out .  i was hooked .  there was one problem ,  though .  i was only 13 years old at the time ,  and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable .  let's just say ,  it was worth the wait !   if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine ,  this movie is it .  to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement .  the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman .  roy scheider ,  who is as effective as ever ,  plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains .  john glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time .  he's sleazy ,  funny at times ,  and always on the brink of doing something crazy .  then there's robert trebor's  ( nice name ,  by the way !  )  character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme .  he is a whimpering ,  sweating ,  coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models .  then ,  you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy ,  a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason .  who could forget the wake-up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear ?   after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against ,  scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation ,  that is until glover goes after his wife !  the conflict is played out brutally ,  with virtually the entire cast getting shot ,  raped ,  or blown up .    i don't know why i love this movie so much .  it really should creep me out ,  but it doesn't .  maybe it's because these characters are all interesting ,  and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try .  it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glover's running around out in l . a .  looking for trouble .  just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle .   " hey sport ,  have a nice day !  "   this film has plenty of shootouts ,  cool cars ,  great dialog  ( like the line in my opening statement )  ,  and decent acting .  plenty of cameos by real life porno stars .  look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glover's place .    another thing i must add :  how hot are the women in this film ?  ?  ?  wow !  travolta did right by marrying kelly preston .  yum !  we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian .  and ann-margret .  what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty .    9 of 10 stars .   so sayeth the hound .   added feb 14 ,  2008 :  rip roy scheider !
1	having only seen two of his pictures previously ,  i've come to terms with altman .  before ,  though ,  i always labeled his style of film-making  " boring .  "  you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius .    " health "  is fairly underrated ,  and very questionably out of print .  in fact ,  i don't think it's ever even been issued to vhs .  why is that ?  when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily ,  this one is left behind for no good reason ?  honestly ,  i had no real problems with this film .  it was ,  for the most part ,  consistently amusing and funny .  almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason ,  be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances .  there is real skill here .   and paul dooley's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating .   if you can ,  try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem .  it's not perfect ,  but it's much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases .  hell ,  i'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing .   it's often on the fox movie channel ,  though ,  so look out for it .
1	brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos .  he died by getting shot in the eye .  this was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the sopranos .  brendan filone is too good .  brendan filone shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior can't take it anymore .  brendan filone is the best character .  brendan filone was killed in episode # 3 ,  denial ,  anger ,  acceptance .  but his legacy will live on forever .  brendan filone is the best character on sopranos !  brendan filone is the best character ever .  i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing ,  because it doesn't get any better than this series .  brendan filone is the best .
1	chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos .  unfaltering performances ,  rock-solid writing ,  and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever .   all of the cast are strong ,  but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy's .  anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes ;  particularly from the first few seasons .  james gandolfini is absolutely fierce ,  absolutely terrifying ,  and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him .   many people that i've spoken to about the sopranos  ( who haven't seen it yet )  will say  " i'm just not a fan of mafia movies/shows "  .  whatever .  run - don't walk - and get it .  those same people usually love  " e . r .  "  ,  but i bet they don't much care for hospitals .  .  .  it's not about the context .
1	this is my favorite show .  i think it is utterly brilliant .  thanks to david chase for bringing this into my life .   season 1  1 .  the sopranos :  5/5  2 .  46 long :  4 . 5/5  3 .  denial ,  anger ,  acceptance :  5/5  4 .  meadowlands :  4/5  5 .  college :   6 .  pax soprana :  5/5  7 .  down neck :  4 . 5/5  8 .  the legend of tennessee moltisanti :  5/5  9 .  boca :  4 . 5/5  10 .  a hit is a hit :  3 . 5/5  11 .  nobody knows anything :  5/5  12 .  isabella :  5/5  13 .  i dream of jeannie cusamano :  5/5
1	the sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90's .  its sad that its over ,  its was the best show on hbo if not on tv ,  not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think ,  it was brilliant .  the cast was excellent .  tony  ( james gandolphini )  is a great actor and played his character excellent ,  as well as the others .  each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long .  the last episode was good ,  i'm not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn't die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense .  tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel .  .  .  long live the sopranos and tony soprano .  .  .  .  .  .  .
1	now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i'm appalled .  for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to .  let me tell u something .  i started watching many t . v shows like lost ,  prison break ,  dexter ,  deadwood and even invasion .  but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season ,  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season .  then we have the sopranos .  i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season ,  and more importantly all of its episodes .  there is no department that this show doesn't excel in .  acting- nothing short of superb .  james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode ,  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would've been the better choice ,  however after watching the first few episodes ,  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony .  the raw emotion he displays is superb .  then we have everyone else ,  edie falco ,  michael imperioli ,  lorraine bracco ,  dominic chianese  ( whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2 )  and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie 'walnuts' gualtieri and silvio dante .  all of these actors perform to the best quality ,  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode .  then we have the story ,  never have i been so sucked into a t . v show before .  the story is nothing short of excellent .  each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic .  i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of .  its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence ,  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television ,  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show .  not just say its too violent ,  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral ,  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day ,  i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god .  i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me ,  you'll be hooked from the very first episode ,  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show ,  hooked on it .  trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t . v .  after you've watched the first season ,  you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television ,  and no t . v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos .
1	" the godfather "  of television ,  but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters ,  the two are nothing alike .  tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks .  his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families -- in one family he is a loving father yet not-so-perfect-husband ,  and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy .  after analysis ,  dr .  melfi concludes that tony's problems actually derive from his mother livia ,  who's suspected to have borderline-personality disorder .  gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character ;  yet bracco and marchand aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother ,  respectively .  falco ,  imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles .  van zandt  ( from the e-street band )  plays his first and only role as tony's best friend ,  and is quite convincing and latching .  chianese ,  the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film ,  plays tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis .  many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore ,  ventimiglia ,  curatola ,  proval ,  pantoliano ,  lip ,  sciorra and buscemi .  tony's children are  " okay "  but not notable  ( with the exception of iler's stunning performance in the third-to-last episode ,   " the second coming "  )  ;  sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top ,  but the show is too strong for them to hold it back .  even as the show continues for over six season ,  it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment .   ****  ( out of four )
1	as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite ,  this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view .  if you've never watched this show ,  you're in for an extended treat .  yes ,  there is violence and nudity ,  but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano ,  the thinking man's gangster ,  with the reality of the life he has been born to and ,  quite frankly ,  would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up .  tony soprano can discuss sun tzu with his therapist ,  then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage ,  and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew ,  take a break ,  sit down and watch tv while eating peanut butter out of the jar ,  and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing nfl football .  even carmella ,  his wife ,  when given a chance for a way out ,  finds that she really prefers life with tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own .  if you followed the whole thing ,  you know how it ends .  if you didn't ,  trust me you've never seen a tv show end like this .
1	though  " the sopranos "  is yet another gift from the megahit  " the godfather "  and sequels ,  which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia ,   " the sopranos "  takes another tack .  no suited up ,  classy mobsters here with homes in lake tahoe and stakes in vegas casinos - these guys are goombahs ,  with a front of waste management ,  who deal with things that fall off the back of trucks ,  topless bars ,  protection money - in short ,  what the neighborhood mobs were all about .   colorful characters dominate this series ,  which doesn't hold back on the sex and graphic violence .  tony soprano  ( james gandolfini )  is a mob head with a wife and two children ,  living in new jersey ,  who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one .  to get to the bottom of his attacks ,  he sees a psychiatrist ,  jennifer melfi  ( lorraine bracco )  ,  who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time .  tony's henchman - paulie ,  his nephew christopher ,  his uncle junior  ( the titular head of the mob )  ,  his good friend pussy - are all fully fleshed-out characters .   as we learn going through the series ,  there are enemies not only from without ,  but from within ,  and one of those enemies includes tony's sickly but horrible mother  ( nancy marchand )  ,  who convinces junior that tony is a danger to him .  tony's sister janice ,  meanwhile ,  is searching for money in her mother's house with a stethoscope and a geiger counter .  tony has mistress problems ,  and a wife  ( edie falco )  who puts up with a lot because she loves him ,  all the while keeping ties to her catholic religion .   " the church frowns on divorce ,  "  she tells one woman contemplating a split .   " let the pope live with him ,  "  is the response .  as far as tony's mistress problems ,  his psychiatrist points out that tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough ,  and asks him if it sounds familiar .  yeah ,  it sounds like his mother .   i'm of italian descent ,  and yes ,  i'm sick of italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all italians are mobsters .  yet you can't help liking this show ,  which is a constant reminder of our culture .   ( thanksgiving ,  it's pointed out ,  isn't turkey and sweet potato pie - it's the antipasto ,  the manicotti ,  the meatballs and escarole ,  and then the bird !  )  not to mention ,  the right-on pronunciation of words like melenzana  ( mullinyan )  ,  escarole  ( scarole )  ,  manicotti  ( manigot )  etc .  the only un-italian thing about tony is that he doesn't have a finished basement ,  something unheard of in the rest of my family  ( except my parents never had one either )  .   the standouts in this show are gandolfini ,  as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants ,  falco ,  who is brilliant as his wife ,  and bracco as the tortured jennifer .  but everyone is excellent .  if you can take the violence and the language ,  this is a great show ,  an unrelenting portrait of new jersey mob life .
1	the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever ,  so naturally my expectations were through the roof ,  and yet the show surpassed them .  i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds ,  but this is so much more .  86+ hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia/action stories ,  but also to be a great family drama ,  a shocking character study ,  a laugh-out-loud comedy ,  a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil ,  and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one .  david chase's epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more ,  and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection ,  paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away .   realism is present when it is needed ,  but chase's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for  " dream episodes "  and the like only adds more layers to the series .  chase--along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter ,  future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively--turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i've seen on tv .   james gandolfini domineers the show as tony ,  one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever .  tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture ,  but he defies the other half entirely ,  and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr .  melfi  ( lorraine bracco ,  with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show )  ,  we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect .   edie falco matches the power of gandolfini's performance as tony's wife carmela .  from her mixed feelings about tony's lifestyle ,  to her suspicions about murders ,  to her torment over tony's cheating ,  to her own thoughts about infidelity ,  carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non- mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world .  scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television .   the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal ,  and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons ,  somehow without any redundancies .  nancy marchand steals the show as tony's overbearing mother livia ,  an insight into tony's personality problems and panic attacks .  the familiarity of marchand's incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far .  michael imperioli is christopher ,  tony's protégé ,  whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed .  drea de matteo plays christopher's girlfriend adriana ,  and is so well- meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher's career .  tony sirico is paulie ,  introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic ,  but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show ,  and nobody plays true anger better than he .  and that's just the tip of the iceberg .   familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich ,  jon favreau ,  ben kingsley ,  lauren bacall ,  will arnett ,  nancy sinatra ,  david strathairn ,  robert patrick ,  hal holbrook ,  burt young ,  and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show ,  while names as notable as joe pantoliano ,  steve buscemi ,  and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series .  there are 50+ great characters with powerful arcs ,  and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show .   comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series ,  which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough ,  the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered .  the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall ,  and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows  ( most of which i disagree with )  .   whether you love or hate the ending ,  or what you make of it is irrelevant :  the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself .  the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history .  there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show ,  so if you're thinking of watching something else instead ,  do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit .
1	the sopranos  ( now preparing to end )  is the very peak of adult television and drama .  when the sopranos hits the mark ,  it really hits the mark .  using great writing and great actors  ( most of them being extras from goodfellas )  the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way .  heading up the cast is james gandolfini ,  who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano ,  and edie falco ,  who certainly holds her own .  the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary  ( usually violence and foul language )  .  tony sirico ,  michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting .  seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi  ( great !  )  ,  joe pantoliano  ( great !  )  ,  david proval  ( good )  ,  robert patrick ,  robert loggia and frank vincent .   the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv .  symbolism and simple story lines ,  dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package .  watch it .  .  .
1	well .  .  .  easily my favourite tv series ever .  call me a walking mail cliché but include violence ,  mafia ,  sex ,  gambling ,  drugs etc .  on a show and you're already winning points on in my book .  combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen ,  add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind  ( and a few brains a long the way )  and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with .   above all stand two actors ,  james gandolfini as tony soprano ,  and edie falco as his wife carmela .  .  .  as for gandolfini ,  he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express ,  if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now !   i can go on and on and on about every character in the show ,  the psychological brilliance ,  the gripping scenes etc .  but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld ,  that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more .
1	the sopranos stands out as an airtight ,  dynamic exploration of american life ,  and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money .  by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld ,  david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt ,  low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era .    every character represents a facet of american industry .  tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff ,  torn between familial duty and a need to keep his  " business "  on an even keel .  the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward .  the characters of christopher ,  paulie ,  and bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise ,  who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit .  with the character of ralph ,  joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath ,  a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power .  and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard ,  which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up- and-comers to deflect blame .   though abrasive and occasionally disturbing ,  the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama .    ps a good companion piece to chase's series would be the shield ,  another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting .
1	i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes .  but if you liked princess bride and forest gump ,  you would like this movie .  you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course ,  but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose .  killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite .  just my opinion .  i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french .  so this film isn't for a world audience .  and while i am not a trained film critic ,  i know what i like .  i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie .  my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .
1	i can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting ,  balanced writing ,  multi-faceted characters ,  a great anti-hero in tony ,  great commentary on millennial american life .  the integral use of psychiatry coupled with tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous .  several other characters add a lot of depth - hesh's interesting history as an outsider muscling in ,  ralphie's total irredeemable viciousness ,  chris' dual desires in life ,  and so on .   i have to dig into some of the criticisms however ,  especially the 'it glorifies violence/belittles italian-americans' one . most of the writers and actors are italian-american ,  would they attack themselves ?  there are several positive italian-american characters - artie bucco the chef ,  dr .  melfi and her family and the cusamanos next door to the sopranos .  indeed ,  dr melfi's ex-husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of italian-americans have ever had mob connections  ( certainly smaller than the proportion of african-americans involved in crime ,  dare i say it .  in both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes )  .   most of the characters don't really choose the life they have ;  family background or circumstances largely corner them into it .  outsiders  ( even of italian stock )  who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - matthew and his friend in season 2 ,  for example .  if you criticise this show ,  i assume frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist ,  or will & grace made you want to go homosexual ?  presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs ,  or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity ,  or rock music which discusses drugs  ( or any other combination )  ?  people aren't as stupid as some of you make out .  .  .  .   not everything is perfect however .  a lot of characters have only appeared once ,  when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - tracee the dancer ,  meadow's friend ally ,  uncle junior's ladyfriend  ( supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1 )  .
1	before dogma 95 :  when lars used movies as art ,  not just a story .  a beautiful painting about love and death .  this is one of my favorite movies of all time .  the color .  .  .  the music .  .  .  just perfect .
1	this is not  " so bad that it is good ,  "  it is purely good !  for those who don't understand why ,  you have the intellect of a four year old  ( in response to a certain comment .  .  .  )  anyways ,  killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself ,  a parody of you ,  and a parody of me .  it is the single most genius text in cinematic history .  i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa .  it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard .  i write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me ,  the likes of which we have never seen .  it can only be taken in portions .  .  .  its sort of exploitive .  .  .  by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum .  my comment ended a while ago .  hopefully it works when i submit it now .
1	the sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch .  it's smart ,  it's quirky ,  it's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can't resist watching .  the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters ,  set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families .  for most of the time ,  you really don't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back ,  or buy them lunch .    further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men ,  most of them murderers ,  but by god if you don't love them too .  i've laughed at their wisecracks ,  been torn when they've made err in judgement ,  and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal .    the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show's subtext - people aren't always as they seem ,  and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds .    if you haven't already ,  you most definitely should .
1	take a pinch of goodfellas ,  mix it with the godfather ,  add some roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy ,  and you have the sopranos ,  about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey .  it's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling .  i am not the biggest fan of this show ,  but i do admire james gandolfini's very complicated tony soprano ,  a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience .  i also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel-voiced dom chianese as the bewildered but murderous uncle junior ,  silver-haired tony sirico as the perpetually perplexed paulie and the very beautiful edie falco as the duplicitous ,  tough-as-nails carmela soprano .  the violence is sudden and graphic ,  the body count steadily climbs each season ,  but it is often the small moments that matter most here .  watch paulie and tony's nephew christopher  ( michael imperioli late of law & order )  as they get lost in the pine barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck ,  both convinced they've had it .
1	i've only watched the first series on dvd ,  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino-like script .  the series is as good as goodfellas and casino ,  and almost as good as the godfather  ( hence not a  " 10 "  )  ,  and far better than any of guy ritchie's efforts .  although there's plenty of action ,  some of it pretty bloody ,  the story is character driven .  even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines ;  e . g .  the priest's relationship  ( or lack of )  with carmilla and the restaurateur's wife ,  and christopher and his dimwit friend  ( who didn't last very long  ( a darwin award nominee ?  )  )   apart from the plot ,  the script and the acting ,  the other reasons i liked it ;   1 .  it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce .  2 .  the music .  3 .  it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .
1	it probably isn't fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten ,  but oh well .  .  .  .  .  .  .   from a standpoint of acting ,  how could any actor fail with these characters ?  each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life .  tony soprano-while a mob  " capo "  and suffering from mental illness ,  still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive .  each of his men ,  you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism .  it definitely brings out a sort  " nosey "  side in each and every viewer ,  and i include myself in this !   while some above don't care for bracco ,  i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas .  she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason ,  that makes him decent ,  that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long ,  if ever .  she is simply put ,  his savior .   ( not speaking in religious tones )   but the knockout performance here is without doubt ,  edie falco .  to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series ,   " oz "  and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress .  she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress ,  something only actresses like merle streep can get away with .  a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles .  but as i have mentioned before ,  with a characters a strong as these ,  how can any actor fail ?   livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself .  she is a survivor ,  as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors .  she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business ,  yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey .  she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself .   all in all ,  the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season .  this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series .  it was what brought the larry sanders show ,  sex and the city ,  dream on ,  and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them .  too much space in between seasons and very sporadic .  until then ,  i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled .
1	i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it .  i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released .  in all 42 episodes so far ,  the best one is definitely episode #3 ,  denial ,  anger ,  acceptance .  this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos .  his name was brendan filone .  he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver .  brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang .  in the end ,  he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath ,  and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos .  brendan filone is # 1 for me .  and my # 2 most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua ,  who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti .  tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him .  my # 3 most favorite character is sean gismonte ,  who was killed right after shooting christopher .  and finally ,  my # 4 most favorite character is chucky signore ,  one of uncle junior's henchmen .  he was killed on a boat by tony .  all the awesome characters are dead .  that's the only bad thing about the sopranos .  all the cool guys always get killed .  you know what would be great to change about the sopranos ?  they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris ,  tony ,  uncle junior ,  silvio ,  and paulie ,  because they need to get their revenge .  brendan filone shall strike back !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 1
1	" the godfather "  ,   " citizen kane "  ,   " star wars "  ,   " goodfellas "  none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of  " the sopranos "  .  each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity ,  completely and utterly three dimensional .  we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly ,  despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs .  evil ,  he is evil .  soprano is the most provocative ,  intricate ,  and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history .  if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer ,  and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment ,  watch  " the sopranos "  .  i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season 1 ,  and not want to continue with the series .  each season is completely brilliant in its own way .  dvds are essential to anybody's collection **** of out 4
1	not only do the storylines in  " the sopranos "  engage audiences from all over ,  but i think  ( for me at least )  what brings the viewers back is the acting .   ( not even you ,  gary ,  can dispute that claim )  james gandolfini ,  who plays the lead-man ,  tony soprano ,  has become  ( in this viewer's opinion )  one of the  " hollywood elites "  as far as acting in a television series goes .  i wouldn't go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino ,  or at least ,  not just yet .  he ,  however ,  does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano .  in the years since 1999 ,  gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor  ( mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos )  that today he is considered to be among the best in the business .  and it's not just him .   " the sopranos "  fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco ,  edie falco ,  michael imperioli ,  dominic chianese ,  and the late nancy marchand who played tony's dreadful mother .  at this point in the show's existence ,  it's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so .  the first two seasons were extraordinary .  violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner ,  but without a doubt ,  extraordinarily done .  the third season was great ,  but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 .  season 4 ,  which wrapped up right before new-years ,  was the weakest season yet  ( or at least ,  in my opinion it was )  .  despite a dry-spell ,  i still found it  ( season 4 of  " the sopranos "  )  to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately i've been noticing a trend in good new television shows .  examples of this :  six feet under ,  the shield ,  curb your enthusiasm ,  and oz  ( which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year )  .  to get back to my point though ,  to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year ,  no less ,  is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers .   " the sopranos "  ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit .  to close ,  i'd like to say ,   " the sopranos "  is the real deal folks .  for the average mature viewer  ( 17 and above )  who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity ,  you might want to check out  " the sopranos "  if you get the chance .  trust me in that it will be well worth the time .
1	the  " gangster "  genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody .  in retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in it's genre ,  thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it .  the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance ,  humor and unvarnished violence .  the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew  , however ,  tony is of two persona's one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent .  with out any inhibitions or contradictions i still adamantly believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory .  all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series ,  but i won't .  if ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital ,  ambiguous ,  unrelenting ,  epic ,  uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you .
1	there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly ,  one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building .  each character unfolds more and more each series .  also each series has an array of different 'small time characters' as well as the main .  a good example of a character  ( who was only in three episodes )  who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick .  every little detail builds the perfect tv series .  the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano  ( james gandolfini )  who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two .  the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable .  whilst tony runs things with capos paulie  ( tony sirico )  and silvio  ( steve van zant )  his nephew christopher  ( michael imperioli )  looks for a promotion .  every episode also features tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano  ( edie falco )  .  on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano  ( dominic chianese )  is trying to get what he can out of tony's businesses despite being under house arrest .  all the acting is powerful and characters complex ,  but the two who stand out the most are ;  james gandolfini who 'is' tony soprano .  also michael imperioli who plays christopher ,  representing the younger  ( 20-30 )  generation in crime .  if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed ,  such as the wire and dexter .  so the sopranos is definitely the godfather ,  goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
1	wow .  i loved the whole series ,  and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly .  perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5 ,  while remaining better than anything else on television .  but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons .    6b started with such a sombre mood and janice's always keen insight into the family angst - that doom-filled line about knowing tony's penchant for sitting and staring .  anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony .  melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series ,  say ,  with tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil's  " wave bye-bye "  line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode  ( not to get into chase's dark humour )  .   i could go on and on ,  but i'll just add that i thought the final show - starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow  (  " you keep me hangin' on "  )  to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj's suv or phil's head were ,  utterly ,  utterly perfect .  the best tv ever .    pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the  " jack-off fantasies "  aj derides  ( and then into which he promptly subsides )  .  a tip of the pork pie to mr .  chase .
1	as a guy who has seen all the seasons ,  i can say that jg constantly surprises me .  i mean ,  after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster ,  u thought to yourself :  ok he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster's skin .  but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life ,  i mean i could almost feel the pain he  " made "  us believe he was going through .  i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro ,  marlon brando and al pacino .  these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more .  but nowadays they are either old or dead  ( brando )  and it's ok that they make less movies and their performances are  " lighter "  than they used to be .  i can't wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role .  can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance ?
1	when we started watching this series on cable ,  i had no idea how addictive it would be .  even when you hate a character ,  you hold back because they are so beautifully developed ,  you can almost understand why they react to frustration ,  fear ,  greed or temptation the way they do .  it's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of christopher's learning curves .   i can't understand why adriana would put up with christopher's abuse of her ,  verbally ,  physically and emotionally ,  but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior .  carmella has a dream house ,  endless supply of expensive things ,  but i'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not .  that's why i watch .   it doesn't matter how many times you watch an episode ,  you can find something you missed the first five times .  we even watch episodes out of sequence  ( watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language ,  a&e with language censored ,  reruns on the movie network )  - whenever they're on ,  we're there .  we've been totally spoiled now .   i also love the malaprop's .   " an albacore around my neck "  is my favorite of johnny boy .  when these jewels have entered our family vocabulary ,  it is a sign that i should get a life .  i will when the series ends ,  and i have collected all the dvd's ,  and put the collection in my will .
1	greetings from this portuguese guy  :  )   i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever ,  it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way ,  that it's hard to see the difference .  it has the same quality as godfather !  james gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove !  i would love the sopranos would never finish at all .  it's perfect !  it should be a subject in school  :  )  i saw sopranos when i was a kid ,  but i was too young to stay waked until the episode ends ,  so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted ,  like i did with prison break .  in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best-ever series made for television .  the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect .  congratulations for such a work .   sorry about my english .  thanks for reading .
1	the sopranos  ( 1999-2007 )   number 1 - television show of all time   everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode .  the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time .    james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss ,  tony soprano ,  accompanied by a stellar cast .  edie falco is superb as the worrying ,  loving upper-middle class mother ;  tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious ,  greying consiglieri who is often very funny .    while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian-americans as mafiosi ,  and to an extent this is undeniable ,  i can see so many positives from the show .  the portrayal of strong family values ,  friendships ,  love and compassion ;  could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters ?  yes .  furthermore ,  other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism ,  social inequality and injustice ,  homosexuality ,  drugs etc .  this is no shallow ,  dull show about tough guys and violence .  it has so much more .  many of the issues we see on the show are very real .    the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives ,  which makes the whole thing more interesting .   credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini ,  for envisioning ,  television's most complex and enigmatic character .    simply exceptional .   10/10
1	what can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude ?   " the sopranos "  has literally redefined television as we know it .  it has broken all rules ,  and set new standards for television excellence .  everything is flawless ,  the writing ,  directing ,  and for me ,  most of all ,  the acting .  watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are not real .  the acting tricks you into thinking there is a real tony soprano ,  or any character .  this show is also very versatile .  some people don't watch the show because it's violent ,  it's not all about the violence ,  it's about business ,  family ,  and many deeper things that all depend on what you ,  as a fan see .  for me ,  i don't like when people refer to the show ,  a show about the mafia .  for me ,  it's a show about family .  a family who ,  through generations ,  happen to be apart of the mob .  overall this is a masterpiece of a show .  this is what television should be .  right here .  complex characters from stunning acting ,  magnificent story lines from brilliant writing ,  and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together ?  a show that defines excellence ,  and dares to be different .
1	the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history .   its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence ,  sublime writing or first rate performances .   across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality .  centering around the life of one tony soprano ,  a man who lives in two families .  one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group ,  of which he is the boss of both .  played by james gandolfini ,  of true romance and the mexican fame ,  tony is a fascinating ,  scary but also likable guy .  full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man .  contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony .   the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever .   the true genius of this tale however ,  is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series .  twenty minute long dream sequences ,  powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence .  yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love ,  honour and respect for family .  the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous .   with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america's most original and compelling drama .  forget family redifined .  this is television redifined .
1	i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine .  what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 ,  it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x .  of course ,  at that time x meant maturity .  since i was only two years old at the time of the movie's release ,  it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then .  however ,  when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film ,  which included prostitution  ( the title itself was slang for a male prostitute )  ;  homosexuality ;  loneliness ;  physical  ( and to some extent emotional as well )  abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day ,  i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release .  it is worth noting that in the 1970's ,  midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r ,  some of the scenes could almost be rated pg-13 by today's standards .   i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie .  jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women .  he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women .  after being rejected by all the women he has come across ,  he meets a sleazy con-man named enrico  " ratso "  rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman .  ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager .  once again ,  joe is conned and before long is homeless .  however ,  joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment .  without giving away much more of the plot ,  i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams .  i . e .  joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health .   i want to make some comments about the movie itself .  first of all ,  the acting is excellent ,  especially the leads .  although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end ,  there are some classic scenes .  in fact ,  there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny ,  i find them amusing .  for example ,  there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over .  dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says  " hey ,  i'm walkin' here !  i'm walkin' here !  "  i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry .  another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso  ( dustin hoffman )  sends joe  ( jon voight )  to a guy named o'daniel .  what is amusing is that at first ,  we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut .  in addition to the two scenes i mentioned ,  i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self-defense  " john wayne !  you gonna tell me he's a fag !  "  what i like is the delivery in that scene .   i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late '60's ,  much of it rings true today .  that's because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years ,  homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago .  also ,  many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character .  one thing that impresses me about jon voight's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie ,  he had matured a great deal and that ratso  ( dustin hoffman's character )  was a good influence on him .   in conclusion ,  i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie ,  one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on .  for example ,  there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings .  also ,  what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck  ( jon voight's character )  and the people who were in his life in texas .  even the ending ,  while i don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie ,  is rather open-ended .
1	first i would like to say how great this .  it is astounding and sometimes shocking .  and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie ,  i can definitely stand a boring film ,  but this is anything but boring .  it is like a trip through humanity .  its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece .  it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers  ( voight and hoffman )  who build a mutual friendship .  joe buck  ( voight )  a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women .  soon he meets rico 'ratso' rizzo  ( hoffman )  ,  who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent .  ratso becomes joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food .  as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is .  they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party .  joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso's dream spot ,  florida .  the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film .  from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life .
1	this is a great example of a good ,  dumb movie .  no ,  it is not high art by any means .  nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks .  but so what !  the killer tomatoes series  ( four movies and a cartoon series )  are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks .   as the title suggests ,  this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france .  in this case ,  professor gangrene  ( john astin's 3rd time in the role )  has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france .  steve lundquist returns as igor ,  a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true king of france .  obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t k of f ,  happily skewering the french language .   opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato  ( like the others ,  ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon )  and his human allies .  mark price ,  recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series ,  plays a thinly disguised version of himself ,  passing himself as  " michael j fox "  as a way to win the girl of his dreams .  and angela visser is a dream as marie ,  gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis .  oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career !  another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell  ( now best known as the hapless title subject of  " who wants to marry a millionaire ?  "  )  .  like co-creator john de bello ,  rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series .   what can you say about jon de bello ?  not much ,  really ,  except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and ,  having done that ,  has apparently dropped into obscurity .  john ,  if you ever see this ,  thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes .   the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie .  like return of the killer tomatoes ,  the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew .  and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox .  this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series .  okay ,  the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series  ( which was also quite clever )  ,  but cartoons just aren't the same .
1	i didn't at all think of it this way ,  but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title  " midnight cowboy "  was a gay porno .  at that point ,  all i had known of it was the reference made to it in that  " seinfeld "  episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed .   the movie was great ,  and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies i can't even remember because they're all crap .   the plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy joe buck going to new york trying to be a hustler  ( a male prostitute ,  basically )  ,  thinking it'll be easy pickings ,  only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling him ,  charging him for their sexual encounter .   then he meets enrico salvatore rizzo ,  called  " ratso "  by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time .  you think of him as a scoundrel ,  but a lovable one  ( like han solo or lando calrissian )  and surprisingly he and joe become friends ,  and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such .  rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad ,  pitiable man who's very sick ,  and very depressed and self-conscious ,  hates being called  " ratso "  and wants to go to florida ,  where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved ,  and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there .   it's heartwarming watching joe do all that he does to get them both down to florida ,  along with many hilarious moments  ( like ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party ,  and getting caught by the woman who says  " gee ,  well ,  you know ,  it's free .  you don't have to steal it .  "  and he says  " well if it's free then i ain't stealin' it "  ,  and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where hoffman almost gets hit by that taxi ,  and screams  " hey ,  i'm walkin' here !  i'm walkin' here !  "  )  ,  and the acting is so believable ,  you'd never believe joe buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor jon voight ,  and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman .  it's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles ,  but the chemistry is so thick and intense .   then there's the sad part that i believe is quite an overstatement to call it  " depressing "  .  ratso rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie ,  can barely walk ,  barely eat ,  coughs a lot ,  is sick ,  and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to florida .  he's hurting badly ,  and only miles away from miami ,  he finally dies on the bus .  the bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong ,  and continues on .  sad ,  but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years .   all in all ,  great movie .  and the soundtrack pretty much consists just of  " everybody's talking' "  played all throughout the movie at appropriate times .  an odd move ,  but a great one ,  as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly .  go see it ,  it's great ,  go buy it
1	jon voight is brilliant in midnight cowboy ,  but hoffman's performance ,  though reminiscent of his later turn in rainman ,  is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies .  as a portrayal of a new york character ,  only daniel day lewis' portrayal of bill butcher in gangs of new york comes to mind as comparable ,  and day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that hoffman gives ratso .    it's typical of hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight .  i think hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels .    voight's buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether ,  except that ratso pulls him down - pulls him down ,  but also teaches him ,  a lot about how to survive and ,  more importantly ,  how to live .   midnight cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself .  i think that ,  as gritty a movie as it is ,  it has a very beautiful message ,  that no matter how much a loser you might be  ( ratso clearly defines  " loser "  )  ,  if you can find a way to be true to yourself ,  you are in possession of the secret of life ,  and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else .    i can't help but compare midnight cowboy to klute ,  from a few years later ,  which i think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape .
1	sandra bernhard is quite a character ,  and certainly one of the funniest women on earth .  she began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s ,  but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorsese's underrated masterpiece ,   " the king of comedy "  .  her film career never quite took off ,  though .  she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures ,  such as  " dallas doll "   ( 1994 )  or  " dinner rush "   ( 2000 )  ,  but the most amazing parts were those she created for herself .    " without you i'm nothing "  is undoubtedly her best effort .  it's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonna's best friend for about four years .  in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes ,  sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross ,  talks about her childhood ,  andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach ,  prince ,  or sylvester .  director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance that's both sexy and uniquely funny .  if you are a bernhard fan ,  you can't miss out this film ;  it's a tribute as well to her  ( weird )  beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne .  and it has influenced filmmakers in their work   " hedwig and the angry inch "  ,  for instance ,  would look a lot different if  " without you i'm nothing "  didn't exist .
1	i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in 1969 .  after actually seeing it ,  however ,  i'm not surprised anymore .  it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style ,  cinematography ,  and use of flashback to help develop joe buck's character .   the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck's character in such a short movie .  i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked .  the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him .  i think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible .   i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role .  otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate .  anyway ,  this considered an all-time great for a reason .
1	jon voight plays a man named joe .  joe is shook up by a haunting childhood .  he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism .  he quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people .  he meets a misfit named ratso ( dustin hoffman )  and the two for a relationship .  they go out and work together in helping each other out .  they become thieves .  the two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other .  however ,  there is something very important that ratso hasn't told joe ,  and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together .  this is one of the greatest films ever made .  it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other .  their story is devastating to watch ,  but is ultimately important for people to see .  it's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street .  the difference is that this film is from their perspective .  their lives are shown to us and it's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt ,  especially if we at one time were one of those people .  however ,  the film doesn't try to guilt trip you .  instead ,  it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling .  it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman .  the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty ,  gritty ,  and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of joe in this film does .  what startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 ,  and it has stood the test of time perfectly .  today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 .  the film was rated x ,  but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest ,  realistic ,  and effective way .  anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous ,  awkward ,  and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that .  the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be .  movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy ,  a clockwork orange ,  greetings ,  last tango in paris ,  and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today .  the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy .  they are not graphic ,  but they are realistic ,  and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film .  the course language that is used in the film ,  particularly the word  " fag "  is used effectively and is not gratuitous .  the violence is very shocking to watch even today ,  but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler .  i'm really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 ,  if not more .  i can't recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten .   pros :    -jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch .  they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual .  you'll forget who is playing them within minutes !    -beautiful score   -not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today   -fantastic and fast editing job  cons :    -for mature audiences only   -the opening scenes are well done ,  but they could be just a little stronger .
1	although i love this movie ,  i can barely watch it ,  it is so real .  so ,  i put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers .  i remembered it vividly ,  but just wanted to see if i could find something i hadn't seen before .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . i didn't :  that's because it's so real to me .   another  " user "  wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary .  i'm all for that  !  it's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about  " midnight cowboy "  may not have been born when it was released .  they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in ,  at a later time .  i'll be just as ruinously frank :  i am 82-years-old .  if you're familiar with some of my other comments ,  you'll be aware that i was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years ,  and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me ,  even if you were familiar with my night-club persona .  do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  ?  you bet i do  !  !  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  . and am not the least bit ashamed .  if you haven't run-into some of them ,  it's your loss - but ,  there's a huge chance you have ,  but just didn't know it .  so many moms ,  dads ,  sons and daughters could surprise you .  it should be no secret many actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of  " midnight cowboy "  .  who is to judge  ?  i can name several ,  current big-time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities ,  and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there .  i make no judgment ,  because these are humans ,  just as we all are - love ,  courage ,  kindness ,  compassion ,  intelligence ,  humility :  you name the attributes ,  they are all there ,  no matter what the package looks like .   the  " trivia "  about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of  " ratzo "  is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles - how do you think he gets his input ?  i can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money .  although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit ,  i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street ,  looking to make a pick-up .   this should be no surprise today ,  although it's definitely action in hollywood and other cities ,  large and small .  wake-up and smell the roses .  they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue .   some of the  " users "  thought  " joe buck "  had been molested by his grandma .  although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend ,  i didn't find any incidence of that .  believe-it-or-not ,  kids haven't always had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom .  whose business ?  hoffman may have begged for change on the streets ,  but some of the  " users "  point-out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of  " midnight cowboy "  - his actual salary would surprise you .  i think he was robbed  !  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role ,  nor that it made him a star for such great work as  " deliverance "  .  he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it :  few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie .  the end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open ,  but society has always been hip .   i also did not find any homosexuality between  " ratzo "  and  " joe "  - they were clearly opposites ,  unappealing to one another .  they found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship .  if you didn't understand that at the end of the movie ,  then you've wasted your time .   " joe's "  bewilderment ,  but unashamed devotion was apparent .  yes ,  voight deserved an oscar for this role - one that john wayne could never pull-off ,  and he was as handsome in his youth .   hoffman is hoffman - you expect fireworks .  he gave them superbly .  wayne got his oscar .  every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around ,  you are mistaken .   " the party "   ?  - attend some of the  " raves "  younger people attend .  .  .  .  . if you can get in .  look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality .   brenda viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times .  if you were shocked by her brilliant acting ,  thinking  " this isn't real "  ,  look at today's  " ladies "  who live on the brink of disrepute .  .  .  . and are admired for it .   the brutality  " joe "  displayed in robbing the old guy ,  unfortunately ,  is also a part of life .  you don't have to condone it ,  but it's not too much different than any violence .   " joe "  pointedly named his purpose - in that situation ,  i'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it .  that's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through ,  one which i do not watch .  i get heartbroken for both .  .  .  .  .   john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- waldo salt didn't write from clairvoyance .  anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history ,  and should be proud for the honesty of it .  perhaps  " only in america "  can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations ,  while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public .  not looking doesn't mean it isn't there - give me the truth every time .  bravo !  to all .  .  .  .  .  .
1	acidic ,  unremitting ,  and beautiful ,  john schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago ,  when american life was even more disorienting .  the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history ,  because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s :  final dissolution of the great american west ,  the intensification of war in vietnam ,  and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety .   'midnight cowboy' is widely known as the only academy award-winning film to garner an 'x' rating ,  but there is much more behind its fame ;  it also exceeds the norm as a work of art .  while this film  ( from the novel by james leo herlihy )  has much to say about the erosion of american life ,  it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras .  the two main characters ,  in fact ,  are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world .   the initial focus of 'midnight cowboy' is on 28-year-old joe buck ,  a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight .  in the opening scenes ,  we follow joe's bus trip to new york city ,  where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler .  we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade .  garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud , ' the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico 'ratso' rizzo  ( dustin hoffman )  ,  a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx .  ratso ,  who is short ,  thin ,  and with a limp ,  proves of little monetary help to joe .  they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months ,  joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names .  it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them ,  the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds .   throughout the film ,  joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas ,  including life with his grandmother sally  ( ruth white )  ,  who served as guardian ;  his harried relationship with 'crazy' annie  ( jennifer salt )  ,  a notorious local girl ;  and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair .  very much of its time ,  'midnight cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks ,  dream sequences ,  and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds .  for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso ,  more questions about their lives are generated .  both men are no doubt in tatters ;  they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive .  this revelation pushes 'midnight cowboy' to its conclusion ,  a rather hopeful one in a very grim story .   while joe and ratso badly need some luck ,  the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt's screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive .  their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast ,  which features sylvia miles ,  brenda vaccaro ,  and members of the andy warhol clique ,  offers itself as an essential part of the storyline .  the flashback sequences involving voight ,  ruth white ,  and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost .   any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film ,  thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender  ( 'the boy who could fly , ' 'smoke' )  and editing by hugh robertson  ( 'shaft' )  .  the visuals of 'midnight cowboy' work with its soundtrack  ( assembled by john barry )  as a cohesive unit ,  sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades .  the lead song everybody's talking is sung by nilsson ,  which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase .  the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean 'toots' thielemans .   'midnight cowboy' has been released in a two-disc collector's edition by mgm/ua ,  which contains expanded features and commentary .  also available is a 1998 dvd release  ( used for this review )  ,  which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5 . 1 dolby digital sound enhancement ;  three-language subtitles and closed captioning ;  french 'dubbing' ;  a theatrical re-release trailer  ( not the 'original' as advertised )  ;  and an eight-page production booklet .  both dvd editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film ,  showing its original brilliance .  well-deserving of its three oscars  ( best picture ,  schlesinger ,  waldo salt )  and additional nominations  ( voight ,  hoffman ,  sylvia miles ,  hugh robertson )  ,  'midnight cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics .   *** ½ out of 4
1	what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both .  there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character ,  but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other .   this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well .  the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns ,  though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors ,  including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film .  also ,  for those interested ,  andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene .   if you haven't seen this movie ,  it is essential .  check it out .
1	" midnight cowboy "  is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason - it really is one of the finest films ever made in america .  its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial .  no wonder it was a huge success when initially released .  but be warned ,  its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made .  the characters are memorable ,  well-developed ,  and ultimately tragic .  the filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the hollywood ending ,  something which was basically mandatory by the 80s .  still ,  this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film .  its a time when well-made ,  innovative ,  and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer .  all this was over by the time  " star wars "  was released .   the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work .  it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing .  unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects ,   " midnight cowboy "  has aged quite well .  its still as powerful now as it was when initially released .  the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece .  the characters' backgrounds are never fully explained ,  but the performances make them completely developed .  both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic  ( despite their sometimes reprehensible actions )  .  plus ,  being a fan of vintage exploitation films ,  i loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street .   " midnight cowboy "  is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made .   ( 10/10 )
1	midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 ,  drawing an x rating .  by today's standards ,  it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating .  jon voight ,  who has been better ,  is competent in his role as joe buck ,  an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city .  he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo ,  who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes .  the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic .  as ratso ,  dustin hoffman simply shines .  hoffman has often been brilliant ,  but never more so than in this portrayal .  he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison .  losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences .  director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production ,  but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer .  worth seeing for hoffman's performance alone .
1	midnight cowboy is not for everybody .  it's raw ,  painful ,  and realistic but very entertaining .  the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances .  voight as the texas hustler ,  joe buck ,  who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler .  he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy .  the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women .  sadly ,  buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas .  he was raised by his grandmother ,  sally buck ,  played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer .  the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship .  the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job .  as the film evolves ,  buck's past comes to the surface and it's haunting but not clear .  the film is not for children but compared to today's films and television programming ,  midnight cowboy might be more tame .  i can't forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you can't forget .  it's also a tearjerker of a film ,  so get your hankies out too .
1	hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler  ( jon voigt )  and his lame con-man sidekick  ( dustin hoffman )  ,  soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills .   a daring film for its time ,  and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s .  symbolic of the  " end of innocence "  in american films ,  since it was the only x-rated film to win a best picture oscar .   jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body ,  but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk .  befriended by a lame con-man  ( dustin hoffman )  ,  he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter ,  ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida ,  a land his friend  " ratzo "  dreams of living in .   but even in this final quest ,  the two are losers .  john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt ,  and john barry's haunting  " midnight cowboy "  theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation .   summing up :  a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life .
1	john schlesinger's 'midnight cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only x-rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture .  this was certainly how i first came to hear of it ,  and ,  to be completely honest ,  i didn't really expect much of the film .  this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible ,  but somehow i didn't consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching .  this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting ,  ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack  (  " everybody's talking' at me ,  i don't hear a word they're sayin' "  )  make this film one of the finest explorations of life ,  naivety and friendship ever released .   young joe buck  ( then-newcomer jon voight )  ,  dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy ,  travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler ,  a male prostitute .  women ,  however ,  do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services ,  and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up .  during these exploits ,  joe comes to meet enrico  " ratso "  rizzo  ( dustin hoffman )  ,  a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money .  when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament ,  ratso offers joe a place to stay ,  and ,  working together ,  they attempt to make  ( largely dishonest )  lives for themselves in the cold ,  gritty metropolis of new york .   joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex ;  however ,  his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman  ( sylvia miles )  twenty dollars .  though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent ,  ratso is just as naïve as joe .  ratso ,  with his painful limp and hacking cough ,  is always assuring himself that ,  if only he could travel to the warmth of miami ,  somehow everything would be all right .  this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck's classic novel ,  'of mice and men . '  shot largely on the streets of new york ,  'midnight cowboy' is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums .  watching the film ,  we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso's squalid ,  unheated residence ,  our joints stiff from the aching winter cold .  the acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism ,  with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society .  hoffman ,  in particular ,  is exceptional in his role  ( i'm walkin' here !  i'm walkin' here !  "  )  ,  managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967's 'the graduate . ' both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars  ( also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was sylvia miles ,  for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes )  ,  though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in 'true grit . ' 'midnight cowboy' eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations ,  including best picture ,  best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt .   'midnight cowboy' is told mainly in a linear fashion ,  though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe's past .  rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about ,  the audience is invited to think about it for themselves ,  and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing .  the achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope ,  but a large amount of uncertainty .  gritty ,  thought-provoking and intensely fascinating ,  'midnight cowboy' is one for the ages .
1	" midnight cowboy "  was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic .  you know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song ,  'everybody's talking' starts up on the soundtrack ,   ( actually not written for the film )  ,  and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck ,   ( naked and in the shower )  .  we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him ?  this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else ,  his performance here would still be legendary .  as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen ;  even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish  " anaconda "  is a source of pleasure )  .   the film became famous and infamous almost overnight .  it was a crowd-pleaser ,   ( even with its downbeat ending )  ,  funny and sexy and recognizably 'real' ;   ( it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true )  .  it was also the first 'x' rated film to win the oscar as the year's best picture .  adapted ,   ( brilliantly )  ,  by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial american movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner .  everyone is recognizably human ,  warts and all ,  and everyone is treated sympathetically .  voight's joe buck is an innocent abroad ,  a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler ,   ( a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy ;  he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker )  .  but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy ,  wormy little con-man called 'ratso' rizzo ,   ( dustin hoffman ,  fresh from  " the graduate "  and he's a revelation )  ,  he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream .   essentially it's a male love story ,   ( though totally platonic )  ,  between these two not so unlikely bedfellows .  both totally alone ,  both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other ,   ( voight with his physical prowess ,  hoffman with his street-wise savvy )  .  they are misfits adrift from the mainstream ,  tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others .  though 'straight' voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself .   ( the whole film posits a strangely 'christian' attitude )  .   it's also magnificently acted .  while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver ,  bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on ,  beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye-view of the american under-belly without rancor and without criticism .  on second thoughts ,  maybe it is a great movie after all .
1	just kidding .   seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in new york city ,  jon voight is young optimist cowboy  ( almost forest gump-like )  joe buck from texas .  it does not take long for the big apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon joe is the target of both the coldness of new yorkers and cons from its street-thugs .  given his pure heart ,  he takes pity on one of these thugs ,  ratso rizzo  ( dustin hoffman )  and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive .   while midnight comedy is labeled as a drama ,  it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion .  it is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban new york city .  the film crams cowboy joe buck somewhere in between ,  thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position .  we feel for his struggle to fit in ,  but also to merely get enough money to feed ratso rizzo .   midnight cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart .  i imagine this film must have inspired both forest gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and ,  to an extent ,  the crocodile dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick new york cosmopolitans .  very compelling and sensationally creative film that i highly recommend .   8 . 5/10
1	saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released .  had me snifflin' like a baby as i left the theatre ,  trying not to let anyone see .  so ,  when i saw it again now in '07 ,  i knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached .  thankfully this time i was at home .   what i hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it ,  was the technical brilliance of this movie .  the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue .  the camera work which seemed to place the viewer ,  together with the characters in the scene .  think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner ,  the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground ,  framing the street scene .    the story itself ,  & the characters - seedy ,  sad & brutally real .  it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn .  then again ,  joe & ratso could be any of us .  must have been '70 when i saw it .  i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was impelled to find the company of friends .  all these years later ,  i'm glad i'm not alone tonight .  this is one hell of a great movie .
1	midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice-over of the main character joe buck  ( jon voight )  singing in the shower .  he is singing a cowboy song ,  the very thing he strives to be .  joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women ,  and even more money .  he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy ,  but in a cartoonish fashion ,  not even his friends take him seriously .  he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers .  this is primarily a story of joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world .   he starts off as a very naïve southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks .  he has no other reason to think otherwise ,  as they proved helpful in the past ;  we learn this from the many flashbacks he has .  in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical .  they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance ,  as they are ,  they are coming out of his past .  however ,  as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past ,  which is no longer whimsical but gritty ,  filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events .  this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted ,  and her being raped .  in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick .  this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart ;  the naiveté that he once carried is falling off of him .  he and ratso  ( dustin hoffman )  are living in squalor ,  and barely able to get food to eat ;  joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks ,  that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didn't envision .  his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out .   ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe ,  but in an opposite way ;  ratso is joe's foil .  joe is a handsome ,  strong man who ,  for the most part ,  has a good outward appearance .  ratso ,  on the other hand ,  from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite .  he is short ,  dark ,  and always coated with a sheen of sweat .  he understands how the world works ,  that it is unforgiving ,  and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail ;  just as his father did .  they are living in the same world ,  the same apartment even ,  but they understand things on a completely different level .   the theme of alienation ,  one that is common of this era ,  is very apparent in this film .  neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them .  joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider .  ratso ,  living in the cold of nyc ,  wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life .  even though this is his ideal ,  in the fantasy we get from ratso's perspective ,  it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society .  in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him ,  he is yet again an outsider ,  alienated from society .   it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow .  joe resorts to violence ;  he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso .  on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film .  he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation .  he dresses ratso the same way ;  he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering ,  but it is to no avail .  upon ratso's death on the bus ,  their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders .  even in this new culture they have entered ,  they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film .  despite the ratso's death ,  and joe's continued alienation ,  the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc .  midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society ,  and alienation ,  with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman .
1	after racism ,  rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s .  westside story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view .  now ,  midnight cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view .  it has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away .   director john schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts ,  dreams ,  fantasies ,  fears and evaluations of two new york city scums .  while the handsome joe buck ( voight )  dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy ,  the poor ratso rizzo ( hoffman )  dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny florida .  accordingly ,  joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality ;  and ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into florida .  besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can .  they begin sharing everything in life .  they share food ,  they share medicine ,  they share an uninhabited home ,  they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny .  regrettably as the story progresses ,  joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun ;  and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there .   the might is always right ,  and the feeble has no right in the daylight .  thence ,   " midnight "  gives the factual sight .   despite the tragedy ,  there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy .  every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate .  thanks to this ,  midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue ,  the rural exodus .
1	fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man .  extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline ,  extremely well-directed by john schlesinger  ( who never topped his work here )  and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman .  packs quite a punch overall ,  yet the  " fantasy "  scenes--some of which are played for a chuckle--are mildly intrusive ,  as is the  " mod "  drug party .  the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental ,  yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy ,  and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than schlesinger .  originally x-rated in 1969 ,  and the winner of the best picture oscar ;  screenwriter waldo salt  ( who adapted james leo herilhy's book )  and schlesinger also won statues .  ***1/2 from ****
1	it's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered ,  but 1969's  " midnight cowboy "  is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time .  directed by john schlesinger and written by waldo salt ,  the movie seems to be a product of its time ,  the late 1960's when american films were especially expressionistic ,  but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period .  the film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in ang lee's  " brokeback mountain "  .   the meandering plot follows joe buck ,  a naive ,  young texan who decides to move to manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women .  full of energy but lacking any savvy ,  he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances .  he meets a cynical ,  sickly petty thief named  " ratso "  rizzo ,  who first sees joe as an easy pawn .  the two become dependent on one another ,  and rizzo begins to manage joe .  things come to a head at a psychedelic ,  drug-infested party where joe finally lands a paying client .  meanwhile ,  rizzo becomes sicker ,  and the two set off for florida to seek a better life .  this is not a story that will appeal to everyone ,  in fact ,  some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures ,  yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic .   in his first major role ,  jon voight is ideally cast as he brings out joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities .  as rizzo ,  dustin hoffman successfully upends his clean ,  post-college image from  " the graduate "  and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to joe .  the honesty of their portrayals is complemented by schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the times square district at the time .  the director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches .  credit also needs to go to salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story .  the other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters ,  including brenda vaccaro as the woman joe meets at the party ,  sylvia miles as a blowsy matron ,  john mcgiver as a religious zealot and barnard hughes as a lonely out-of-towner .   the two-disc 2006 dvd package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer jerome hellman since unfortunately neither schlesinger nor salt are still living .  there are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary ,   " after midnight :  reflections on a classic 35 years later "  ,  which features comments from hellman ,  hoffman ,  voight and others ,  as well as clips and related archive footage such as voight's screen test ;   " controversy and acclaim "  ,  which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'x' rating and public response to the film ;  and a tribute to the director ,   " celebrating schlesinger "  .
1	'midnight cowboy' was rated x with the original release back in 1969 .  there are some scenes where you can understand that ,  just a little .  the movie about joe buck  ( jon voight )  coming from texas to new york city to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing .  dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler ,  making money by the act of love .  it does not work out as he planned .  after a guy named rico 'ratso' rizzo  ( dustin hoffman )  first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends .  they live in an empty and very filthy apartment .  then ratso gets sick and joe has to try to make some money .   the movie was probably rated x for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things .  the editing in this movie is great .  we see dream sequences from joe and ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way .  dustin hoffman ,  jon voight and the supporting actors give great performances .  especially hoffman delivers some fine famous lines .  the score is done by john barry and sounds great .  all this makes this a great movie that won the best picture oscar for a good reason .
1	at the time i recall being quite startled and amused by this movie .  i referred to it as the most important movie i'd seen in ten years ,  and found myself bumping into people who said similar things .    bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook .  and she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had ,  into a corrosive ,  adult world-view .  the two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers .   ( hi skip .  i wish you weren't my brother so i could **** you !  )    bernhards search for herself after returning to la from new york ,  results in the immersive trying-on of various personas  ( all of which fit poorly )  for our amusement ,  but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a  " black imperative "  values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her .   ( it's been a while .  nina simone comes to mind .  and she has an impressive ,  solidly-built black lover in the movie )  a pretty black girl attends the shows ,  and seems to be authorizing sandra's faux-blackness ,  but ultimately rejects her .   just as catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for christ ,  here sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place ;  as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection .  it's the only value system implicated in the films world ,  outside of bernhards arty confusion .   for a nation whose chief issues are racism and money ,  it's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way .
1	joe buck  ( jon voight )  decides he's going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city .  the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly  " tutti-fruttis .  "  wide-eyed ,  he comes to new york city ,  not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences ,  one worse than the other .  in the middle of that chaos ,  he meets and befriends rico  " ratso "  rizzo  ( dustin hoffmann )  ,  a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building .   there isn't much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck's plights in the city ,  but also inter-cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past :  his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie  ( jennifer salt )  who was gang-raped ,  his abandonment by his mother ,  and his apparent abuse by his grandmother ,  who also had a habit of hustling men for money .  an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery  " everybody's talking' "  ;  we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city ,  the odds are high he won't and will end up working for pennies in a dead-end job -- shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself .  we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this .   a dark story of dashed hopes ,  john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s ,  and at the center ,  the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life .  there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- ratso's reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film ,  one that manages to survive ,  literally ,  to the death ,  and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed ,  older ,  wiser .
1	i sat down to watch  " midnight cowboy "  thinking it would be another overrated '60s/'70s movie .  some of my favorite films come from the '70s ,  in the same vein as  " midnight cowboy "   (  " taxi driver ,  "   " mean streets ,  "   " panic in needle park ,  "  etc .  )  but there are many ,  many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today .  i sort of feel this way about  " easy rider .  "   ( although it ,  too ,  is one of my favorites .  )   so ,  i didn't expect much from  " midnight cowboy "  but got a lot back .  it's a touching story ,  well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time .  dustin hoffman ,  as enrico  " ratso "  rizzo ,  gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times  ( he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - maybe because of the lenny/ " simpsons "  connection )  ,  but hoffman is entirely convincing .  half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood .  opposite him is the second-billed jon voight as joe buck ,  the  " cowboy "  who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute .  soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named  " ratso "  - who offers to become joe's  " manager "  for a certain percentage of profits .   the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long .  some films can tend to drag ,  especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because  ( as it's been said in  " easy riders ,  raging bulls "  )  the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material ,  going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc .  that aren't important .  just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated  ( similar to the drug odysseys in  " easy rider "  )  and really harms its flow because it's not needed .   other than that ,   " midnight cowboy "  is an almost flawless motion picture .  i was pleasantly surprised .  it does have its flaws  ( flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been ,  for instance )  and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy  ( such as the gay movie theater sequence )  but if you can handle its content  " midnight cowboy "  is a truly great motion picture ,  an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60s/early '70s .  it's a depressing movie ,  yes ,  and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of  " life is horrible ,  etc .  "  .  .  . but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long ,  long time .   highly recommended .  one of the best films of the '70s .   ( it was technically released in late 1969 but i'd still categorize it as a 1970s film .  it also won the best picture oscar ,  being the first - and only - x-rated motion picture to do so .  it was later re-rated r on appeal .  )   4 . 5/5
1	the only reason i knew of midnight cowboy was because it was in the afi critic's top 100 .  for a top 100 it is not a very well known movie ;  indeed ,  i had to look hard to find a copy ,  i got the dvd version for about half-price .  surprisingly it was only rated m15+  ( the uncut version )  .   i doubt many will take notice of this review  ( more like comment )  so i'll make it brief .   this is perhaps one of the strangest movies i've seen ,  partly because of the use of montages ,  artistic filming  ( very art-house )  and the unusual theme .  there are many things in the film i still don't understand  ( i've seen it twice )  ,  and it makes for an emotionally confusing film .   the filming and acting were very good ,  and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable .  the main character is joe buck ,  a 'cowboy' from texas who moves to new york to become a male prostitute .  he meets the crippled conman enrico 'ratso' rizzo and ,  of course they become friends going through the usual escapades .  what makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different .   i felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between buck and enrico rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection ,  although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic .  you probably already know what happens by reading the reviews ,  but its pretty obvious from the start .   i personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes .  the deprivation of humanity  ( shown by the darkness of the city streets ,  the breaking-down tenements )  .  most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law  ( a conman ,  giggolo . etc )  yet you can't help liking them .  joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic ,  while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film .   i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period .  at the time  ( and even now )  it was definitely not a typical movie  ( quite art-house )  .  at a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns ,  musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as midnight cowboy pops up .   on a personal level ,  i must say i quite liked the film .  the imagery conveyed a dream-like quality .  i particularly liked the scene at the party ,  the music ,  images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching .  however ,  as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking  ( not really my style of movie )  in thrills .  this is a film to be savoured and appreciated ,  rather than a cheap thrills action flick .   although i would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film ,  the characters and their motives were quite interesting .  from what i understand from the flashbacks ,  joe buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother ,  although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story .  he is a happy-go-lucky young stud ,  who suppresses his darker memories .  the religious connotations in the film are also puzzling .  some have suggested a homosexual connection between buck and ratso ,  although i fail to see where they have got the idea from .  the theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation ,  and later in joe buck's encounter with a lonely old man ,  but it has little to do with the main story .   certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade  ( it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel )  and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do .  while it has a simple ,  sentimental story to it  ( disguised by a hard edge )  the beauty of the film is in the strange ,  often psychedelic sequences .
1	watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing .  i was too young to watch it when it was originally released ,  and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago ,  but it has absolutely stood the test of time ,  and i have watched it several times since .    everything about this film is brilliant ,  from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman  ( even though i know this movie well ,  i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks ,  or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way )  to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences .    it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one .  midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools .    10/10
1	virile ,  but naive ,  big joe buck leaves his home in big spring ,  texas ,  and hustles off to the big apple in search of women and big bucks .  in nyc ,  jb meets up with frustration ,  and with  " ratso "  rizzo ,  a scruffy but cordial con artist .  somehow ,  this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty ,  sometimes brutal ,  urban america ,  en route to a poignant ending .   both funny and depressing ,  our  " midnight cowboy "  rides head-on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change ,  and thus confirms to 1969 viewers that they ,  themselves ,  have been swept away from the 1950's age of innocence ,  and dropped ,  dorothy and toto like ,  into the 1960's age of aquarius .   the film's direction is masterful ;  the casting is perfect ;  the acting is top notch ;  the script is crisp and cogent ;  the cinematography is engaging ;  and the music enhances all of the above .  deservedly ,  it won the best picture oscar of 1969 ,  and i would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade .
1	in my opinion ,  this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the afi top 100 list  ( though it's shamefully too low on the imdb top 250 list ,  at only #183 as of this writing )  .  if you enjoy acting of the highest calibre  ( voight and hoffman are a superb match )  ,  well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction ,  editing and cinematography ,  you'll love this just as much as i did .  schlesinger paints a vivid ,  always credible picture of the late 60s new york city scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality ,  poverty and hopelessness of 42nd street ,  new york city .   the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement  ( and of the city )  and are nothing less than dazzling .  i've seen many ideas  ( including the rapid-fire editing ,  the handling of the voice-over flashbacks ,  the drug/trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror )  stolen by other filmmakers .   the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having it's homosexual underpinnings .  i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times ,  but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life ,  whether it be sexual or not .   midnight cowboy is a brave ,  moving film of magnitude ,  influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years ,  so if you haven't seen it ,  you're really missing out on a true american classic .  i recommend this film to everyone .   score :  10 out of 10 .
1	young ,  handsome ,  muscular joe buck  ( jon voight )  moves from texas to new york thinking he'll make a living by being a stud .  he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another .  at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled ,  sleazy ratso rizzo  ( dustin hoffman )  .  together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida .  but will they make it ?   very dark ,  disturbing yet fascinating movie .  director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants .  in that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now .  he also uses every camera trick in the book--color turning to black & white ;  trippy dream sequences ;  flash forwards ;  flash backs  ( especially involving a rape )  ;  shock cuts ;  weird sound effects .  .  . you name it .  it keeps you disoriented and off center--but i couldn't stop watching .   there isn't much of a story--it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck .  there is an implication that they may have been lovers  ( the final shot sort of shows that )  .  it's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold ,  cruel ,  urban jungle .   this was originally rated x in 1969--the only reason being that the mpaa didn't think that parents would want their children to see this .  nevertheless ,  it was a big hit with high schoolers  ( back then x meant no one under 17 )  .  it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture .  hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was  ( mysteriously )  sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of  ( maybe )  5 minutes !  it was eventually lowered to an r  ( with no cuts )  when it was reissued in 1980 .   also the excellent song  " everybody's talkin' "  was introduced in this film--and became a big hit .   a great film---but very dark .  i'm giving it a 10 .  don't see it on commercial tv--it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible .
1	i typically don't like reality shows ,  particularly the ones that are profiting off of  " american idol " 's success .  but this one i can live with .   comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts ,  and if they like them ,  those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience .  then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do  " survivor "  style competitions using comedic tactics .  then one will be determined as  " last comic standing .  "  i do like stand up comedy ,  so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests .  there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through .  it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden ,  ralphie may ,  and josh blue .   my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama .  at first they lived together in a house like  " big brother ,  "  but now they've done away with that ,  thank god .   and there are a lot of comedians i felt ,  were only chosen not because they're funny ,  but because of race ,  ethnicity ,  attitude ,  sex ,  etc .  when other comics clearly should've beaten them out .  but overall ,  it's a well-made reality show ,  which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron .
1	horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination .  we all know that killers like freddy ,  jason ,  michael and even leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day .  most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains .  and let's hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them .  this is where imagination wins out over fact .  horror ,  and most films in general ,  requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow .  this usually isn't a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c .  scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville .  but what i do have a problem digesting  (  without wanting to regurgitate  )  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film .  to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself ,  but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed .  there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is .  but the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done ,  suspenseful ,  blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough .  if the film would have offered me a different killer ,  then i would actually be raving about it .  this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film ,  but believe me ,  anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me .   john cassevetes plays dr .  sam cordell .  he and his daughter jenny  (  played beautifully by erin flannery  )  have just recently moved to this small new england town .  cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died .  we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  (  one can only presume it is his wife  )  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour .  her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed .  again ,  i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway .  cassevetes ,  it has to be mentioned ,  is strange to say the least .  cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental .  there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities .  it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent ,  but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug .  thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy .    casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan .  he has a deceptive smile and a virile ,  commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice .  but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene .  he just has that slimy ,  disingenuous ,  phlegmatic ,  uneasy way about him .  he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film .  i guess that is a credit to the writers ,  the director and to cassevetes himself .  there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go .    the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry .  there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see ,  something or someone is watching them .  when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck ,  the young woman wanders into the shed ,  just to play a prank .  once she is there ,  she is attacked .  the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail .  hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in .  he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner ,  and then smacko ,  the guy gets it .  it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note .   also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces .  tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place ,  he has another dream .  toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother ,  a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galen .   throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time ,  the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped .  this is my first feeble  ( and careful )  attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement .  it just didn't strike the right chord .   the incubus is a well done film .  it is tense ,  tight and even most of the performances are very well done .  i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders .  but when you get through all that was good in the film ,  you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth .  and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones .    7 out of 10-- this could have been a nine .  too bad .
1	shocking ,  well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces .   small town doctor tries to discover who ,  or what ,  is committing a series of violent sexual murders .   incubus is a tight mystery ,  with some horrific murder sequences ,  that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist .  the murder scenes are intense and gory ,  so this isn't a film for the squeamish !  the direction of john hough ,  along with a bizarre music score ,  combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film .  it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well .  nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight .   the cast isn't bad either .  the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town .  also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter ,  helen hughes as the town historian ,  and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen .   all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated .   *** out of ****
1	this is a wonderful film .  .  .  first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women's baser motivations diverge  ( vive la difference  !  )    you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses .  human beings are a bit rubbish really ,  but we have big hearts and we try our best ,  despite temptation .  it's not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be resisted ,  that's just who we are .   there is a consistent stylishness from start to finish ;  crisp photography and sharp composition ,  very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content ,  well suited music and laugh out loud scripting .   watch out for the very young  " lone wise voice "  .  .  .  brilliant ;  wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition .
1	this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad ,  unfortunate death at the box office .  i saw this film at a local art cinema , in revival form , shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas .  it certainly deserves to be approached a second time  ( or even a third )  .  sandra b .  takes it to the limit by doing spoken word & taking on some well known songs in this piece  ( her version of hank william's 'i'm so lonesome i could cry' could easily move you to tears )  .  maybe someday ,  audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously  ( but not without some well placed laughs , too )  .  the film moves at a brisk pace  ( thanks to some nice editing )  , so that some viewers will not find it stale & boring .  perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .
1	this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time .  not only is it revolutionary in its narration ,  but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians .  felix herngren and fredrik lindström are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today ,  and this film really puts that on display .    " vuxna människor "   ( adult people )  is a warm-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood ,  and the question if we wouldn´t be better off without it .
1	this is a very funny movie !  i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not .  however ,  i do think men all over the world can identify with  " frank "  and his thoughts to some extent !  these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm sure !   all cast members perform well ,  and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us .  but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish ,  you are in for a treat !   highly recommended .
1	high energy raoul walsh classic from 1933 ,  the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy ,  george raft ,  with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry .  it's not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about ,  but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids .  plenty of wisecracks at the beginning ,  but the characters soften up as the film progresses .  apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery's saloon .  the various characters ,  sexy chorus line ,  lots of drinking ,  a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so-called pre-code restrictions ,  and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself .  it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that's long gone .  i don't like to compare eras ,  but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today .  the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see .
1	i love this freekin movie !  walsh is a true master of the cinematic form ,  his film have been sometimes in my opinion ,  overlooked .  but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in . \  all the wonderful characters that existed ,  the lifestyle ,  the mode of dress ,  the way they spoke ,  ok they might be exaggerated ,  but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts .   i just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact .   can i get it somewhere on dvd ?  i have only seen it on tv .  but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one .
1	in brooklyn a century ago ,  the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge .  this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof ,   " bowery bugs "  from 1949 .   this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers -- a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes ,  giving the film a great deal of historical interest ,  in my view .
1	four words account for why this film was made -  " she done him wrong "  .  the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition .  here we are rewarded with a fast moving ,  well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars .   wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals ;  jackie cooper is a little harder to take ,  but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress .  with a strong director - as walsh proves himself to be - wray could carry a lot of punch ,  and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery's affection .   lots of atmosphere ,  beautifully designed ,  this is a forgotten film worthy of revival .
1	george raft as steve brodie ,  the carefree ,  dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare ,  is pitted against the lumbering ,  sentimental ,  chuck connors  ( wallace beery )  . a soft touch for every panhandler ,  connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays ,  notably runaway orphan  " swipes "   ( jackie cooper ,  complete with kittens !  )  and the homeless lucy calhoun ,  an out-of-town innocent with ambitions to become a writer .    in this male-dominated culture ,  communication takes place mostly in the form of violence  ( one sees why the bowery is a martin scorsese favorite )  .  exploding cigars provide a running gag .   " swipes "  enjoys throwing rocks through windows in chinatown ,  on one occasion setting a laundry alight .   ( the simultaneous arrival of both brodie's and beery's volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl ,  during which the building burns to the ground .  )  beery casually saps a troublesome girl ,  and thumps anyone who disagrees with him ,  including brodie ,  whom he defeats ,  in a night-time fist fight on a moored barge ,  to regain control of his saloon ,  lost on a bet that brodie wouldn't have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge .   ( brodie does make the leap ,  but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment .  )   as usual ,  walsh fills the frame with detail ,  illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin ;  singing waiters ,  bullying barmen ,  whores from suicide hall being hustled into the black maria ,  tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don't want .  a minor but admirable little film .
1	a favourite of mine , this movie tells of two feuding new york  " characters "  ,  steve brodie ( raft )  and  " chuck "  connors ( beery )  , who both strive to be the  " main guy "  in the bowery in the late nineteenth century .   brodie ( 1863-1901 )  and connors ( 1852-1913 )  , were real people , though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics ( based on a play )  . brodie's legendary ( did he do it ? - it's still a cause of argument !  )  , jump from the brooklyn bridge ( 1886 )  , for which he became famous , is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish-american war ( 1898 )  . director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period , so beautifully recreated here , and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbray ( a young pert kelton )  . raft is at his slickest as brodie , and beery shows again what a clever actor he was , as tough ,  big hearted ,  and at times quite touching connors . pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing .   full of life and energy ,  " the bowery "  moves at a fast pace ( unlike many early  " talkies "  )  . it is not an easy movie to find , but is well worth looking out for .
1	culled from the real life exploits of chuck connors and steve brodie in 1890s new york ,   " the bowery "  is high energy and good natured .   but be warned :  casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of wallace beery and little jackie cooper .  the very first shot might be startling .  this is true to the time it was set and the time it was made .  and it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods .  it certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere .   beery as connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action ,  a loud-mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade .  and he has a soft spot for ornery orphan cooper .  raft as brodie is connors' slicker ,  better looking rival in almost every endeavor .  brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention ,  leading up to a jump off the brooklyn bridge  ( it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy )  .   beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on irish-american accent .  he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children ,  cats and ladies in distress .  this is possibly the most boisterous character raft ever played ,  and he even gets to throw in a little dancing  ( as well as a show of leg )  .  and again he mistakes the leading lady  ( lovely fay wray )  for a prostitute .  cooper is as tough as either of them ,  though he gets a chance to turn on the tears .   the highlight isn't the jump off the bridge but a no-holds-barred fistfight between connors and brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals .  it's sure someone bruised more than an ego .
1	when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud . this is not steven kings best work .  i thought that his best work was the shining .  i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking .  as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick .  i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius .  making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool .  people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all .  don't expect something from a movie that it isn't .  it still in a general area wasn't that good .  i still recommend people to watch the movie
1	did sandra  ( yes ,  she must have )  know we would still be here for her some nine years later ?   see it if you haven't ,  again if you have ;  see her live while you can .
1	there is something about pet sematary that i never felt anywhere else .  maybe the fact i was a kid when i first watched it made this experience so memorable .  but as i keep watching it over and over again ,  it never gets old ,  and i never get bored .  from the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending ,  there is something insane ,  sad and scary at the same time ,  and it keeps ringing in your head :  sometimes dead is better !    i don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again .  all you need to know is it starts from point a  ( the most perfect situation for a happy american family )  and step by step drowns to point b  ( which is ,  believe me ,  the very end of all joy )  .  the music is perfect ,  the story makes sense ,  the special effects are cool ,  and the pet sematary is the last place on earth i would be .  like i said ,  sometimes dead is better !
1	if you ever have the chance to see sandra bernhard live in person ,  you better move on it sweetie .  i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row ,  and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show .  she is now in new york with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner ,   " without you i'm nothing "  .  we have lost richard pryor ,  lenny bruce ,  nina simone ,  but sandra is still with us .  patti smith is missing in action ,  but not sandra .  barbara streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where babs leaves off .  okay ,  i want it known ,  ms .  bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more .  i really wanted to push this film because of its truth ,  honesty ,  humor ,  eclectic songs  ( ranging from laura nyro ,  sylvester ,  nina simone ,  prince )  ,  and a script that defines the decadence ,  joy ,  sadness ,  ups and downs of the 70's and 80's .  it is my opinion that many  ( and i mean ,  many )  comics have lifted ,  okay outright stolen ,  so much from this show if not from sandra herself .  i won't name names but come on ,  people ,  you and i know who they are .  see ,  the thing is ,  bernhard plays by her own rules .  this movie shows ,  as does her live performances ,  that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business ,  as well as pushing forward .  her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs  ( during the time of miles davis , coltrane , monk )  ,  70's tv shows ,  intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan jett .  most comedians couldn't even touch where sandra is coming from or going to .  so ,  here i was ,  a year ago ,  watching sandra at the silent movie theater ,  in total awe and joy .  i wanted to meet her after the show ,  give her something that meant something to me ,  that ,  hopefully would mean something to her .  but i listen to my copy of giving til it hurts ,  and just thank her in a prayer ,  of sorts for making me laugh ,  making me think ,  making me feel .  you can't deny this lady's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage .  she's still here ,  damn it ,  even after the release of without you i'm nothing ,  some 15 years ago .  and she looks great ,  by the way .  i know this firsthand ,  walking from the theater one audience member said to another ,   " she is so funny .  . and she still looks incredible !  !  !  if you can't experience her live yet ,  please see this movie .  as for me ,  i do hope that sandra will see this .  you've meant a heck of a lot to me ,  gotten me through some tough crazy times .  if you can send me an email ,  please do .  if not ,  knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so ,  is enough for me .  come on ,  people ,  give it up for the lady !  !  !  !
1	overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come .  although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct .  the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts .  i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie  ( because i hadn't found out about the movie yet )  but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal-mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected .  overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts  ( relative accuracy and overall making sense )  and for its bad parts  ( large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies )  .
1	personally ,  i absolutely love this movie and novel ( i read the book first and decided to see the movie )  .  first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind .  the acting is also great and i love the cast .  judd crandall  ( plays fred gwynne )  fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you .  there are also a few corny lines thrown in there  ( idk if they were meant to be corny )  ,  but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh .  the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie .  not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again ,  i recommend this 100% to any horror fan !  !
1	ah ,  clichés ,  clichés ,  clichés ;  they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films . this one ,  has a lot of them . still ,  it's stephen king ,  one of the best masters of horror .  this movie was really good ,  just too predictable .  and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people ?  this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken .  pet semetary i found to be creepy a little .  the way everything is set up was really spooky ,  but not terrifying .  for the most part ,  the acting was somewhat believable ,  the suspense wasn't that suspenseful ,  but the entertainment level is set at a major rank ;  my eyes were practically glued to the screen . all stephen king fans must see this movie ,  but as for anyone else ,  expect an okay thriller .
1	probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet .  not surprising ,  since king himself wrote the screenplay .  the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house .  one of the other residents is jud ,  a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area .  one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard .  the other is a path leading to the pet sematary ,  where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway .  soon enough ,  ellie creed's cat ,  church ,  is found dead .  luckily ,  this happens while the family ,  with the exception of louis ( the father )  ,  is away for thanksgiving .  jud takes louis to another burial ground ,  beyond the pet sematary ,  where church is to be buried .  later ,  louis is greeted ( not so politely )  by church .  he's returned ,  appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in .  maybe he was buried alive .  maybe not .  nothing more i can say without ruining the story .   of all the king adaptions i've seen this would be the most terrifying .  the characters are real and the situations are normal .  mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings .  suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film ,  due in part to the plot development .  the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever .  then ,  of course ,  we have the conclusion .  easy to determine what's going to happen ,  but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary ,  and sometimes disturbing ,  moments .   overall ,  this is a good film and an excellent adaption .  if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then  " pet sematary "  is just what you're looking for .  non horror fans will want to avoid this .
1	so often with stephen king adaptations ,  you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books .  this really captures the heart of the book .  maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book ,  but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story .  a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage .  dale midkiff and denise  " tasha yar "  crosby really act like his parents .  there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage ,  and they are very natural together .  fred gwynne is wonderful .  he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody ,  and is wise and warm just like jud should be .   ( 8 out of 10 )
1	ok ,  first i have to point the fact that when i first saw this flick i was 9 years old .  if i had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time ,  i´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply-made-cable-tv horror film with some well-made scenes .  but when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts .  this scared the hell out of me back then ,  especially those aforementioned zelda- scenes  ( and they still do )  .  nowadays i´m kind of hooked to this film .  i have to see this maybe once in a month ,  and on every new year´s eve i watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends .  it´s like an appetizer for a good party !  i kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense .  midkiff and crosby do look like i wanted louis and rachel look like ,  but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two .  hughes and gwynne pretty much save the scenes which  " the creeds "  underact .  what i actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to pet sematary ,  and i don´t mean the zombie stuff here .  the atmosphere of this film is certainly a novelty and one of a kind .  honestly ,  how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-tv one ,  but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ?  alright i busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago ,  but i have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection .  but hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to pet sematary !  i really would love to know .  .  . and i don´t mean night of the living dead here .  .  . this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .
1	*****spoilers herein*****  what really scares you ?  killer sharks ,  or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message ?  maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath ?   maybe .  but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider--and that is the death of one's own child .   " pet sematary "  taps this base ,  primal adult fear ,  and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore .   i've read comments about this film that include poor acting ,  characters making stupid decisions ,  etc .  i disagree .  the acting is actually first rate for a film like this .  maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario .  but the film's events are not only logical ,  they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible .  this is the true horror of  " pet sematary "  :  it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels ,  it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does .  despite warning ,  or even past history .   the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart .  the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect .  and the results are horrifying .  in fact ,  when the film dives into slasher territory near the end ,  it's almost a letdown ,  although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there .   i am a true horror fan ,  and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made .  if you don't think so ,  see it again after you have children .
1	minor spoiler  underrated little stephen king shocker .  it's not perfect ,  by any stretch of the imagination--even if the limp performances of dale midkiff and denise crosby were better ,  there'd still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with .  the old micmac burial ground ,  rachel's terminally ill sister ,  and the jacob-marley-an victor pascow never really come together into anything coherent ,  and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed .  but few horror movies really are perfect ,  and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock .  `pet sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory ,  with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of zelda .  it's politically incorrect ,  it's tasteless ,  it's gratuitous--and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way `safer' horror movies never can .  add to that one of fred gwynne's best performances and mary lambert's witty direction ,  and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie--even with the hokey ending .  highly recommended for genre fans .  7 . 5 out of 10 .
1	" pet sematary "  succeeds on two major situations .  first ,  it's a scary horror movie .  those that just aren't produced in these days .  second ,  it's an emotional ,  clever movie overall .  so if you are looking for chills ,  scares ,  creepiness and visually stunning settings ,  great acting ,  dialongs ,  and gruesome effects ;  this is the movie you are looking for .  a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan .    probably ,  the best adaptation to any of king's novels .  the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel ,  but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror/drama accomplishment .    stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time .  the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members .  then ,  when everything seems to be happiness  ( technically happy ,  because the title  " pet sematary "  does not offers appiness !  )  a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere ,  now it turns very dark .  the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits ,  but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad ,  gray ,  creepy .  dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life ,  and  " pet sematary "  proves it dramatically .    the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience ,  but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot .  sadly enough ,  the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead .  the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much ,  much worse .  what will happened with the lives of our all american family ?  could pascow prevent this tragedy ?  what is it with the surreal nightmares ?    watch  " pet sematary "  to witness one of the most touching ,  emotional horror movies of recent times .  you won't regret .  the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father .  he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation .  but that's just my opinion .  denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble ,  tender mother .  baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts .  *shivers* .  overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears .  .  .  the loss of someone you love ,  the dead returning to life ,  and a feeling of desperation .   something is for sure .  .  .  i don't wanna be buried ,  in a pet sematary !  !
1	making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is never a good idea .  when people read the book ,  they automatically start making their own  " mental movie "  of who the characters look like ,  the places they exist in ,  how the situations progress .  and everybody's mind's-eye opus is different ,  which is why when the 'real' movie finally comes out ,  you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up .   all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is ,  and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see .   there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king .  when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories ,  the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying  ( carrie ,  'salem's lot ,  the dead zone )  ,  or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess  ( kubrick's version of the shining ;  the miniseries for it and the tommyknockers )  .    although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation ,  pet sematary has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book ,  that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings .  for that ,  we have music video-turned-film director mary lambert to thank ,   ( she also directed siesta ,  not exactly a horror movie ,  but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list )  ,  working from a screenplay by the 'man-ster' himself ,  and probably one of his better ones .   since the majority of you know the story ,  i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details .  dr .  louis creed  ( dale midkiff )  has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country .  well ,  almost perfect ,  except for two nasty little details :  the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front ,  and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back .  since louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son .  .  . well ,  even if you haven't read the book ,  do the frickin' math .  it is a king story ,  after all ,  so no mystery where this is headed .    it's not so much the destination that counts here ,  but the spooky stops along the way .  certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery ,  scream-inducing life here :  rachel creed's  ( star trek's denise crosby )  horrific memory of her terminally ill ,  crippled sister ;  louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger victor pascow  ( brad greenquist )  ,  both before and after his death ;  the trip into the  " other "  cemetery beyond the pet cemetery .  and that third act .  .  . if it doesn't give you a few nightmares ,  maybe you should check your pulse .   good performances by all here ,  especially the late fred gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor ,  jud crandall ,  who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up :   " sometimes ,  dead is better .  "   about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of louis's son ,  gage  ( miko hughes )  .  knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this ,  lambert and crew still did the best they could ,  and unfortunately ,  hughes at the time was just too damn cute to  " sell "  his intended role as an evil ,  demon-possessed zombie .  this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up ,  though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged ,   ( especially gwynne's death scene .  )   other than that ,  everything else is still about as good as it gets .  carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned ;  but sematary is right up there in the top five .   still ,  will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story ?  not bloody likely .  .  . for now .
1	well ,  this might be one of the funniest movies of all time ,  and sandy gives a tour-de-force performance !  alas ,  her career never quite took off ,  but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures :   " the king of comedy "  ,   " dallas doll "  ,  and  " without you i'm nothing "  .  she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america .  sexy and fierce ,  tender and sensual ,  philosophical and melancholic ,  she convinces the audience in every scene ,  and she actually is  " really pretty "  .  watch this one  ( if you're not from iowa )  ,  you'll certainly enjoy it !  !
1	this is one of the creepiest ,  scariest and most heartbreaking horror movie ever !    dr creed  ( louise )  and his family moving in to new home with his wife  ( rachel )  ,  daughter  ( ellie )  and little son  ( gage )  everything seems normal until dr creed loses one his patient who had a terrible head injury , then he is haunted by the ghost know as victor takes him to the pet sematarty and show him that where the dead come to life .   louis not knowing if that was all dream and is talking to ellie who worried about her cat that could be killed by lorry and then later on rachel tells louis that it really hard for to talk about death because of her sister zelda who was really sick  ( as we see in a flashback how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scene ever !  )    the next day louis gets a call from jed saying there cat as been killed by lorry and jed take him to place where victor the ghost told him not to go !  and bury the cat ,  his wife and kids have go to see their grandparents and louise is home alone shocked to see the cat is back and now it as evil in it eyes so he goes to see jed then jed tell him that he also buried his dog there too  ( as we seen other flashback )  .   later on in the movie the family out having picnic ,  gage is playing with kite and gage say's i drop it "  ,  the wind blow the rod near the road where a lorry coming at fast past ,  gage is get closer to road ,  louis is rushing to get him ,  the most heartbreaking scene in any horror movie will leave with your jaw on floor or shivers will go down your back when you hear louis screams ,  soon he missing him so much ,  louis then buries gage in same place where is buried the cat .    the scariest thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie are not too far from really life .    this movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great !  10 out 10
1	i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable .   i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary .   the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out .  and the  " no fair "  uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance .
1	" pet sematary "  is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title .  the story follows the creeds - an all american ,  middle-class family ,  who move into a house out in the country .  the family consists of louis and rachel ,  and their two young children ,  ellie and their toddler son ,  gage .  the house couldn't be better ,  and the family meets a strange but friendly old man ,  jud ,  who lives across the road .  he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves .  and just beyond there ,  lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power .  when the family cat ,  church ,  is killed ,  louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough ,  soon after ,  church returns to life .  but there's something evil about him now ,  he isn't the same cat he used to be .  and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage ,  louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son .  .  .  unfortunately ,  he gets more than he bargained for .   having read stephen king's novel ,  i can say that the book is much better than the film .  not to say the movie is bad ,  because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better .  the real strength in this film lies in it's story ,  which is both bizarre but extremely original ,  something that king's stories are typically known for .  the script is very well adapted from the story ,  and while it minorly differs in some aspects ,  it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation .  there are a few plot holes here and there ,  nothing major though .  besides that ,  this movie is actually pretty scary ,  and it succeeds in it's intention to do so .  there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film ,  and i'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel's sister zelda is the number one .  honestly ,  that is one of the most disgusting ,  disturbing things i've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody ,  it's just flat out sickening .  one thing's for sure ,  that image won't leave your head anytime soon .   the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there .  this film is actually on the gory side ,  there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there ,  including the shocker of an ending .  i really liked the way they ended the film ,  it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive ,  but it worked better that way with all things considered .   overall ,   " pet sematary "  is a good horror movie that i'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general .  the story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too .  one of the better stephen king adaptations i'd say .  7/10 .
1	louis creed ,  a doctor from chicago ,  moves to a large house near a small town ,  since he is going to be giving classes in the university of maine's .  along with him ,  is his wife rachel and their two kids ,  ellie and gage , as well as ellie's cat ,  church .  soon ,  they met their new neighbor , and old man named judd crandall . judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house ( that is constantly a way used by big trucks )  but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house .  judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery ,  but rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children ,  since she has traumas from her sister zelda's death .   during the first week of the family in the new house ,  louis already has dead people to deal with :  victor pascow ,  a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident ,  addresses his dying words to louis personally ,  even though the two men are strangers .  on the night following pascow's death ,  louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets pascow ,  who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not  " go beyond ,  no matter how much you feel you need to .  "  louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream ,  until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles .  anyway ,  he dismisses the dream .  many strange things starts to happen and church ,  ellie's cat ,  dies while walking on the highway .  louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about church's death with ellie ,  but judd ,  sympathizing with him ,  jud takes louis to the pet cemetery ,  supposedly to bury church .  but instead of stopping there ,  jud leads louis farther on a frightening journey to  " the real cemetery "  :  an ancient burial ground that was once used by the micmac  ( ' .  .  . indians .  .  . ' )  .  there louis buries the cat on jud's instruction ,  with jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life .  and that is where the real horror story begins .  .  .   i personally find this movie very good .  it's not the most horrifying of all ,  but it is one of the best horror movies i watched .  the way gage dies ,  is almost impossible to not stay in your memory ,  specially being a toddler .  it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral .   of course ,  there are some script errors :  how can a rich doctor with two small kids ,  goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house ?  how gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck ?  why louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters ?  things like that doesn't make any sense ,  but i can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work .   a good thing i saw in this movie ,  is the necessity to talk about death with the children ,  no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist ,  and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything .  because of louis being afraid to be honest with ellie ,  confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again ,  all the nightmare began .
1	as this happens to be one of most favorite novels  ,  i was very excited to see the move .  i was not disappointed !  yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on  ,  but i think that the movie stuck true to the book ,  and was a really good movie .  it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review  ,  but this is one of the good ones .  it is such a dark story  ,  which i guess is why i like it  .  .  and what is better than the dead coming to life .  .  and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too .  if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book !  !  it is a well written screen play  ,  the actors could have done a better job  (  i only say this for rachel  ,  and ellie  .  .  she was so whinny  )  i liked everyone else a lot .  .  and most important to me  .  .  it stuck true with the novel .
1	in the trivia section for pet sematary ,  it mentions that george romero  ( director of two stephen king stories ,  creepshow and the dark half )  was set to direct and then pulled out .  one wonders what he would've brought to the film ,  as the director mary lambert ,  while not really a bad director ,  doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of king's novel ,  of which he wrote the screenplay .  there are of course some very effective ,  grotesquely surreal scenes  ( mainly involving the sister zelda ,  likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film )  ,  and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect .  but something feels missing at times ,  some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably king-like atmosphere ,  which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in  ( who knows if he'll save that for his final novel .  .  .  )    as mentioned though ,  some of the casting is terrific ,  notably miko hughes as gage creed ,  the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie ,  to being a little monster  ( i say that as a compliment ,  of course ,  especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel )  .  and there is also a juicy supporting role for fred gwynne of the munsters ,  who plays this old ,  secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone .  and applause goes to whomever did the make-up on andrew hubatsek .  but there are some other flaws though in the other casting ;  dale midkiff is good ,  not great ,  as the conflicted ,  disturbed father figure creed ,  and his daughter ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all .   in terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces ,  only a couple really stand-out :  a certain plot-thickening moment  ( not to spoil ,  it does involve a cool ramones song )  ,  and the first visit to the pet sematary  ( the bigger one )  ,  including the sort of mystical overtones king had in the shining .  for the most part it's a very polished directing job ,  though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script .  if thought out in logical terms  ( albeit in king terms )  it is really one of his more effective works of the period .  but it doesn't add up like it could ,  or should .  still ,  it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .
1	pet semetary  ( 1989 )  9/10 the creed family have just moved into the small town of ludlow .  the family consists of a father ,  louis ,  a mother ,  rachel ,  a brother gage ,  and a daughter ,  ellen .  they are greeted with kindness by jud crandall .  jud is 89 ,  and could basically tell you about the entire history of ludlow .   behind the creed's new house ,  there is a path leading to a pet cemetery  ( spelled pet sematary )  .  when ellen wants to go up to see it ,  jud willfully takes the family on a trip .  that is the start of hell for the creed family .   when rachel and the kids are gone ,  ellen's cat church dies .  jud feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat ,  so he suggests louis follow him further up the path ,  past the pet cemetery .   jud tells louis of this burial ground ,  once used by micmac indians .  louis buries church ,  without jud's help .  a couple of days later ,  church returns ,  alive ,  but from hell .   this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me ,  aside from  " the exorcist .  "  the greatest performance would ever be zelda ,  rachel's sister with spinal meningitis ,  or victor pascow ,  a ghost who tries to help the creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead .   the music in this movie plays an extravagant part .  it is at the same time sad and mysterious .  it goes along with the movie wonderfully .   9/10
1	i am a big fan of stephen king's work ,  and this film has made me an even greater fan of king .  pet sematary is about the creed family .  they have just moved into a new house ,  and they seem happy .  but there is a pet cemetery behind their house .  the creed's new neighbor jud  ( played by fred gwyne )  explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery .  that burial ground is pure evil .  jud tells louis creed that when you bury a human being  ( or any kind of pet )  up in the burial ground ,  they would come back to life .  the only problem ,  is that when they come back ,  they are not the same person ,  they're evil .  soon after jud explains everything about the pet sematary ,  everything starts to go to hell .  i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film .  the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good ,  but needed a little bit of work .  the story was one of the main parts of this movie ,  mainly because it was so original and gripping .  this film features lots of make-up effects that make the movie way more eerie ,  and frightening .  one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back ,  was in fact the make-up effects .  there is one character in this film that is truly freaky .  that character is  " zelda .  "  this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise .  zelda is rachel creed's sister who passed away years before ,  but rachel is still haunted by her .  the first time zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything ,  but the second time is the worst ,  and to be honest ,  the second time scares the living **** out of me .  there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie ,  it is almost perfect .  pet sematary delivers great scares ,  some pretty good acting ,  first rate plot ,  and mesmerizing make-up .  this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time .  10 out of 10 .
1	pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel .  mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king's creepy story pretty well .  most people may avoid this ,  but they should check it out .
1	one of the best  ( if not the best )  stephen king's screenings .  dark as dark can be ,  surprising non-hollywood ending ,  terrifying atmosphere ,  amazing book adaptation ,  outstanding cast ,  educational  ( don't play with afterlife )  ,  in short - everything an excellent horror should be .  .  .   my favorite horror movie ,  straight 10+ .
1	sandra bernhard's without you i'm nothing ,  the movie released in 1990 ,  followed on the heels of her 1988 off-broadway stage production  .  .  .  what she and others refer to in the movie as her  " smash-hit one-woman show .  "   there were several changes in monologues and one-liners ,  and the movie version visually re-vamps the story ,  taking sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in new york ,  during what she calls her  " superstar summer ,  "  to an illusory ,  almost desperate existence back in her home in los angeles - her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting sandra back  " to her roots ,  to  .  .  .  upscale supper clubs like the parisian room .  "   there's a point to be made here .  sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of american pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it .  in l . a .  she's playing to a predominantly black audience ,  trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is  " shashonna ,  "  a madonna-look-alike stripper .  and even then ,  with shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from  " like a virgin ,  "  there's not much to be said for the audience's enjoyment of the show .  the scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone .  a funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping shashonna out of her pants .   but ,  if she's going down ,  sandra's doing so with style and force ,  conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability  .  .  .  right to the point at which she's naked  ( literally )  ,  pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom .  her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein ,  jerry lewis ,  bianca jagger ,  ralph lauren and  ( what we're lead to believe is )  warren beatty are fictional and hilarious .   sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment ,  performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone's song  " four women "  while dressed in a mufti and other african garb ,  singing lines such as  " my skin is black ,  "   " my hair is wooly ,  "  and  " they call me sweet thing .  "   she resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for andy warhol :   " leave it to andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the indian product  .  .  .  that they've been so lucky to cash in on this whole santa fe thing happening .  "   she expounds on the excessiveness of hollywood ,  consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him ,  saying  " mister ,  if this is about ishtar ,  i'm getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that's too self-indulgent even for me !  "   sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism .  dressed as a cosmo girl ,  sandra retells her young-girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss .  she eventually concludes in relief ,   " i'll never be a statistic ,  not me .  i'm under 35 ,  and i'm going to be married !  "   sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society :   " when he touches you in the night ,  does it feel all right ,  or does it feel real ?  i say it feels real .  .  .  mighty real .  "   finally ,  she cries for change in progressive american society by channeling disco greats patrick cowley and sylvester and proclaiming ,   " eventually everyone will funk !  "   all this comes in the form of glitzy ,  schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by billy paul ,  burt bacharach ,  hank williams and laura nyro ,  to name a few .  at the same time ,  the idealized ,  fictional incarnation of sandra -- her self-generated mirror image -- floats around town ,  a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the kabala ,  studying chemistry and listening to nwa rap music .   in without you i'm nothing ,  sandra bernhard explores emotions and existences that ,  up until then ,  she'd only toyed with as a regular guest on late night with david letterman .  her almost child-like enthusiasm for shock ,  exhibited throughout the '80s ,  is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure ,  and her confidence in the face of materialism and american celebrity proves refreshing .  this approach to comedy would change sandra's direction forever and mark the more mature ,  more personable entertainer to come .   if you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour ,  celebrity ,  sex ,  loneliness ,  despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship ,  this movie will keep you in stitches .  it may not be meant to be funny across the board .  perhaps it's a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some .  but consider the emptiness of the world sandra paints for you ,  and you'll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is .   but see without you i'm nothing with a friend  " in the know "  because it's definitely funnier that way .  before you know it ,  the two of you will be trading sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else .
1	this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff , fred gwynne ( who sadly died few years ago ) and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects . director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style , and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing , but genuinely unnerving . the depiction of the zombie child gage ( miko hughes-later in  " new nightmare "  ) is equally noteworthy , as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky . as for the people , who think that this one isn't scary-watch it alone in the dark ( eventually with your squeamish girlfriend ) and i guarantee you that  " pet sematary "  will creep you out . some horror movies like this one or  " the texas chain saw massacre "  shouldn't be watched in group . recommended for horror fans !
1	i have screened this movie several times here at college ,  and every time i show it ,  the number of people watching with me grows exponentially .  .  .  in addition to the virgins ,  anyone i've already shown it to needs to see it again !  it takes a little while to get into it ,  but by the end the whole room is screaming ,  shouting ,  yelling ,  rewinding scenes repeatedly ,  repeating dialogue ,  and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in  " the lonely lady "  !  scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed ,  poorly written ,  horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own  ( no small statement ,  friends )  .  for me nothing compares 2 u ,  pia .  .  .  and i don't suppose i'm the only one who's ever felt this way !
1	i kind of liked the lonely lady .  give pia a break .  she looks great and she has really nice eyes .  what's not to like ?  the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel .  actually ,  a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel .  but its a trashy movie .  a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad .  i liked this better than valley of the dolls ,  which was not only trashy but boring as well .  at least this wasn't boring .   pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer .  watching her talk about pushkin and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable .  i'm sure pia's a nice person in real life ,  she just doesn't project the writer vibe .  she looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a glittery disco dress .   a couple of the scenes are funny .  the one where she tells the two-timing actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to  " stop hanging around !  "  ,  all the while he's practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by .   pia's nervous breakdown scene is good .  it was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it  ( the vortex of floating faces and freeze-frame scream - whoa !  )  and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone .   the acceptance speech is a hoot ,  though .  i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class .   but ,  again ,  this is trash we're talking about .  you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties .
1	bad script ,  bad direction ,  over the top performances ,  overwrought dialogue .  what more could you ask for ?  for laughs ,  it just doesn't get any better than this .  zadora's over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the  " hollywood "  machine .  almost as funny as  " spinal tap "  even though it was clearly not intended as such .  don't miss ray liotta's debut film line ,   " looks like a penis .  "
1	the title has many meanings - the boxing ring ,  where differences and grievances are fought out ,  a wedding ring ,  where mabel feels trapped and jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble ,  a ring-like bracelet that bill gives mabel as a love token .    former professional boxer ,  danish carl brisson ,  was given his start in films by alfred hitchcock in  " the ring "  .  a very young ian hunter ,  who went on to have such a long career in movies ,  plays bob corby ,  who catches the eye of a pretty girl ,  mabel  ( lillian hall davis )  at a fun fair .  she happens to be engaged to  " one round "  jack sander  ( carl brisson )  but that doesn't stop her flirting with bob .  bob is persuaded to go  " one round "  with jack .  he goes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if jack is as good a fighter as they have heard .  he offers to take jack on and jack goes off ,  along with his boorish trainer  ( the great gordon harker )  to make his fortune with plans to marry mabel when he makes good .  jack wins his fight and marries mabel the next day ,  but the deep attraction that she and bob feel for each other is still there .  jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight bob for his wife .   at last a boxing movie where the hero doesn't go off the rails - bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only mabel acted in the same way !  !  !  she has left him for bob - and the fight at the end is a mighty one .  it is intensely realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film .  from being raw and enthusiastic ,  jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds ,  reuniting with mabel ,  gives him the courage to triumph .  the question is why would he even want her back - from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with bob - why wouldn't she do it again ?   the film is loaded with symbolism .  jack ,  shaking hands with the promoter ,  changes to mabel's hands accepting a bracelet from bob .  when jack puts the ring on mabel's finger ,  bobs bracelet slips down her arm .  at the end jack sees mabel's reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on .  this is an excellent film that will not disappoint you .   highly recommended .
1	'one-round' jack sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience .  if they can last one round ,  they win a prize--a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago .  jack is in love with the ticket girl ,  mabel ,  though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack .  what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ ,  so he's able to beat jack--though it takes him some work .  as a result ,  bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit .  later ,  jack improves so much that he ,  too ,  becomes a legitimate boxer .  slowly ,  he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the champ .   in the meantime ,  the champ and mabel start running around behind jack's back--even though by now mabel has married jack .  so ,  when the final fight occurs between jack and bob ,  it's very personal and jack is ready to kill him .  is he good enough ?  will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance ?  tune in and see .   this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films ,  back in the 1920s ,  hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote  ( he did both for this film )  .  in fact ,  in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock's silent style ,  as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents ,  the manxman  ( also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband )  .  so ,  while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day ,  it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending .   overall ,  while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly ,  the film works well .  while far from a perfect silent ,  it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch .
1	another silent love triangle film from hitchcock ,  not a mystery ,  but very english ,  very well-paced and photographed .  smooth boxer bob corby  ( ian hunter )  recruits circus boxer  " one round "  jack sander  ( carl brisson )  to be his sparring partner ,  partly to keep the pretty but fickle mabel  ( lilian hall-davis )  nearby .  there are lots of character actors and grotesquesat jack and mabel's wedding the verger ,  standing in the aisle of the church ,  registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men ,  the fat lady ,  the conjoined twins who ,  of course ,  argue about which side of the aisle to sit ,  and the wedding feast is amusing .  the rest of the movie has jack losing mabel and boxing his way back to her heart ,  or something like that .  it was another era altogether ,  with the audience in evening dress ,  and the boxers dressing up ,  too ,  when out of the ring .  the camera angles ,  the pace ,  the use of symbols ,  the cuttingall very stylish and masterful .  the camera-work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping .  brisson's good looks are well-used in this one ;  his smiling is not so oblivious of what's going on around him as he is in hitchcock's the manxman ,  and so is not annoying .  but can boxers have such dimples ?
1	hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film .  the plot of the film ,  involving two boxers fighting over a girl ,  is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it .  hitchcock's talent ,  though ,  is found in his stunning use of images .  nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols .  especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer .  he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know .  the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was .  the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women .  the object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust ,  not reason or love .  the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships .  all in all ,  the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller .
1	i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films ,  because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc .  so ,  that being said ,  i would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc .   now ,  that may be overshooting a little bit ,  the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above ,  but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s ,  i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them .  as an almost brand new director ,  there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career .   granted ,  the film does start with ,  among other things ,  the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer  ( and i use idiot in the definitive manner ,  the way stephen king so often does )  having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people .  i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then ,  but i think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any hitchcock film i've seen .   the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round ,  but when he meets his match ,  it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger .  so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman ,  who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly .    ( spoilers )  there is ,  for example ,  a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and ,  just before going into the building ,  she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss .  this kiss is never explained ,  and there is also the fact that ,  even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband ,  or at least ultimately chooses him ,  they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss .   the film is certainly beautifully photographed ,  even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years .  there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack's trainer who ,  in his stone faced expressionism ,  reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton .  hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous ,  but this is a great sample of his early work .
1	this early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images .  it's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically ;  note ,  for examples ,  the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery .   its core ,  though ,  remains the final match ,  which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing .  even though you know that the hero has to win ,  it becomes quite believable that he will lose ,  and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his ,  motivating the final plot pay-off ,  is very well entwined with the progress of the match .  the inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should ;  you can almost hear the ticking  ( even though this is a silent film ,  the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them )  .  the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid ,  and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it .   the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of laserlight ,  a public domain company .  as with each hitchcock silent they've released ,  they've attached various musical selections ,  mostly orchestral ,  to the action .  the sound editing is frequently sloppy ,  and the sound quality varies widely ,  but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices ,  and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well ;  it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here .   this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest .  it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films .
1	surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock .  one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself ,  this film shows remarkable story structure .  it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ  " one round "  jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter .  the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack ,  his girl and the professional boxer .  the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men ,  this time for the heavyweight crown .  even in this early film ,  hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement .  an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness .  the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 .  the final match ,  as a result ,  ends up being somewhat anticlimactic .  the story ,  though ,  is what carries this film through .
1	at first ,  i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it's ordinary plot .  how surprised was i !  of course ,  the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter ,  with laughter and fear ,  with compassion and anguish .  the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair ,  the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men ,  the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies ( north by northwest ,  the rope ,  etc .  )  .  the master did it great even before his thirties !
1	the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals ,  as many of his earliest pictures do ,  with a love triangle .  at first glance ,  it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of cecil b .  de mille ,  but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture .  even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers ,  he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense .   as well as being a student of the german expressionist style ,  the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock .  but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery .  this is apparent from the opening shots ,  where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo .  and like eisenstein ,  the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in ,  we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring .   there is also a contrast ,  particularly with silent films from the us ,  in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards .  as much as possible is conveyed by imagery ,  and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters' speech .  and it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting ,  it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing ,  particularly with point-of-view shots ,  as well as some strong yet subtle performances .  there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices  ( particularly double exposures )  ,  many of which were unnecessary ,  but there is far less of this than there is in the lodger .   let's make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors .  first up ,  the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role .  in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role ,  as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist !  but that just goes to show how much i know ,  as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting .  playing his rival is the competent ian hunter ,  who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s .  the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian hall-davis ,  torn between two lovers .  she pulls it off very well however with an emotive ,  understated performance ,  and it's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era .  and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role .   the ring's climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent-era hitchcock .  martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull ,  as his watchword for these scenes was  " stay inside the ring "  .  the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots ,  but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it ,  with close-ups and point-of-view shots .  hitchcock's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience ,  and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character's fear or paranoia .   the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger .  it's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture ,  and probably the best of all his silent features .
1	the symbolic use of objects ,  form editing ,  the position of characters in the scene .  .  .  these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had .  the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses ,  the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger .  .  .  while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards ,  in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken .  even the title has a least four meanings that i can see ;  the boxing ring ,  the wedding ring ,  the bracelet the lover buys ,  and the love triangle at the heart of the story .
1	this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space .  as a history of space flight ,  it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it .  disney has shown it on  " vault disney "  and i wish they would do so again .
1	i have not seen this movie !  at least not in its entirety .  i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all .  one sequence remains in my memory to this day .  a  ( very convincing looking )  spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon .  the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him .  the moon flashes into visability  .   .   .   .  and for a few seconds there it is .  parallel lines ,  squares ,  could it be  .  .  then the light fades and the brief glimse of  .  .  . what .  .  .  has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth .  wonderful .  i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie .
1	this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why .  even 45 years later ,  it is quite an impressive piece of work .  why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain .  good use of live footage and animation in tandem .  this used to run as part of  " vault disney "  every few months or so ,  but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while .  *sigh* most recommended .
1	not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994 .  but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher .   the plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida ,  but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman ,  and when he realizes that he was seen ,  well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff .   shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's ,  especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill ,  this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known ,  it's a pity it isn't .  this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes  ( just try guessing who the final girl is going to be - i got it totally wrong )  .  the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away ,  which of course they don't .  this ,  coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half-an-hour jars  ( in a good way )  with some flashes of real nastiness  ( the second murder provides a real jolt )  and some unexpected sleaziness  ( even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra  ( accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast )  ,  in a film from this late in the 80's )  .   there are one or two bad things about this movie ,  well not bad just minor ,  like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic .  there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but ,  to my mind at least ,  it's a slasher flick through and through .  the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting .   all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher ,  with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff .
1	oh ,  where are you going ,  my little one ,  little one .  .  .   turn around and you're two ,  turn around and you're four .  .  .   i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on disneyland .  i remember sitting there ,  electrified by werner van braune's explanations of rocket science .  i watched as history ,  science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities .   that was fifty years ago .  and the shows are back in the disney treasures series ,  and what a treasure they are .  i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter ,  who at first would not even come in the room ,  but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated .  as she watched i watched her ,  and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as i had been .   turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own .  .  .   sure ,  some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong .  but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate ,  and the overall presentation is still impressive .  i found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class ,  not only as a 50 year old artifact ,  but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history .   turn around ,  turn around ,  turn around and again .  .  . you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years .
1	buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when  " humanizing "  animals ,  and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them .   based on a true story ,  buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other ,  and that they will do anything for each other .   while not a perfect movie ,  the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children .   this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets ,  but does show the difficulties .   a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions .
1	trudy lintz  ( rene russo )  was one very fortunate lady many years ago .  she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money .  her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds .  trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children .  they dressed in clothes and had many amenities .  one day ,  she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla .  knowing nothing about the large apes ,  she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life .  once out of danger ,  trudy decides she will raise the gorilla ,  also ,  as one of her children .  this works well for years and buddy ,  the gorilla ,  is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home .  but ,  buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous .  will trudy be able to keep buddy under control ?  for those who love animals ,  buddy is a must-see movie .  based on a true story ,  trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore .  of course ,  buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one ,  in the film ,  but he is very close to seeming totally real .  russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice .  the costumes are exemplary ,  as befitting the earlier era of the story ,  and the settings and production values outstanding .  but ,  most importantly ,  animals are here in abundance ,  not only buddy ,  but the adorable chimps ,  the ducks ,  the rabbits ,  and so forth .  for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven ,  here on earth ,  this is a great movie choice .  all animal lovers ,  and even those who just want to watch a great family film ,  will go  " ape "  over buddy .
1	europa  ( zentropa )  is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago .  this film is truly unique ,  and a work of genius .  the camerawork and the editing are brilliant ,  and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film ,  creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience .   the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed .  max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator .   a one of a kind movie !  four stars  ( highest rating )  .
1	i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst .  the gorilla looks just terrific ,  and the eyes were especially lifelike .  it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top .  rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine .  usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla .  it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans ,  how they feel the same emotions we do ,  and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't .  not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity .
1	this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser .  bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser ,  and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson .  the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive .  after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife .  is pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes .  the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story .  how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it .  since there was real no name actress in this picture i can't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8
1	this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense .  we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen .  then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them .  we know there will be dynamite in the car ,  that he will lose a wheel ,  that the car will have a crash ,  just to speak of the car .  and that is what happens .  now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film .  that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap .  now ,  how is he going to get out of it ?  that's what you must discover by yourself .  and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story .  a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river .  we also know when he is going to be wounded .  they did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days .  it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq .  but what is the meaning of such a film ?  this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem .  but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil .  why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance ?  when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them ,  to do them .  it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive .   dr jacques coulardeau ,  university paris dauphine ,  university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
1	this was the first  " walking tall "  movie i saw ,  i think in a $2 movie theater along hollywood blvd .   ,  so i didn't have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker .  i remember being shocked at the corrupted system of mcnairy county and the brutality of the  " redneck gangs "  .  i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide ,  and went out to do something about it .  courageous  ?  i thought so - to a point where it sent shivers up my spine .   i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest .  i was pretty blown away about it ,  and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero/anti-hero genre ,  which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the  " the punisher "  ,  but even more so because it's a true story .  the recent remake starring the  " rock "  just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of buford pusser .   a  " classic "  that i'm sure will resurface again in the future .
1	i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job ,  they must have anyway because since watching the movies ,  i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff buford pusser as i can .  all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and buford pusser was a true hero ,  i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him .  i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave .  i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain .  my heart goes out to them .  so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff pusser and of the 3-part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him ,  please do not be negative about these movies and actors ,  they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had .  and to all the young people who may have not heard much about buford ,  i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him .
1	the story is extremely unique . it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly . the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time , friends , and mentors .   the ending could have been fantastic . it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad .   the animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays . i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity . i actually found it to be somewhat decent . the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess .   overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic .
1	being an otaku since the days of robotech ,  i can still say that gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time .  considering when it was made ,  the animation is of superior quality .  there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality .  although the final episode is in black and white ,  it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film .  although it has been described as being  " sappy ,  "  it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do .  since the main character is a female ,  it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to  " macho-man "  tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers .  the seiryuu for noriko ,  incidentally ,  also plays akane in ranma 1/2 .  noriko is as 3-dimensional a cartoon can get ;  her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will .  the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears .  even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious  " homing laser "  and  " buster shield "   ( which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style )  technique .  i doubt that scene was meant to be funny ,  but it cracked me up .  yet all in all ,  i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time .
1	here's a real weirdo for you .  it starts out with another take-off on the psycho shower scene ,  on campus ,  then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break .  the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean .  one of the college cuties wanders into the woods ,  witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open .  then it's lets-rip-off macon county line-time as dean stalks ,  traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one .  tony march is on-target as the evil ,  shotgun-happy dean .  the movie's overall tone is truly disturbing .  the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film ;  it's also a study in despair .  shallow grave is a must for misanthropes ,  misogynists and nihilists the world over .
1	this anime is a must-see for fans of evangelion .  it's an earlier work of anno hideaki ,  but his unrestrained ,  dramatic style is quite in place .  also ,  those who didn't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable .  gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it's actually based on real science .  in fact ,  the show has several little  " science lesson "  interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie .  one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light .  the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed .  the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably .  be warned ,  this show is heavy on the sap at times .  it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen .  i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes ,  because the series is otherwise very good ,  but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one .  on an interesting note ,  gainax ,  as always ,  managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes .  however ,  they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway .  the ending is a bit silly ,  but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it .  gunbuster is ,  in my opinion ,  one of the finest pieces of anime around .
1	/* slight spoilers */  way back ,  before evangelion was made ,  before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans ,  and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite ,  gunbuster was made .  with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time ,  and the famous otakon shorts or course ,  gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up .  it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before ,  space opera .   luckily ,  gainax decided to put it out as a six-part oav  ( direct to video )  series .  this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film .  this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long ,  with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way .  besides that ,  they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam ,  and many other popular space operas .   for one ,  the shows starts out pretty light ,  with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting .  noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle ,  when she was still a little kid .  this makes her life at the academy quite hard ,  as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors .  the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama ,  with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school .  things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced ,  and noriko and kazumi  ( best girl in class )  are chosen to help the assembled fleet out .   the middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space ,  focusing on both personal drama and action .  a couple more characters are introduced ,  and parts of noriko's past are dragged up again .  besides that ,  the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute ,  and the gunbuster ,  mankind's final hope ,  is presented .  smart as writer okada was ,  he incorporated the principles of time dilation ,  to spice things up a bit .  in short ,  time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light .  this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete .  also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated ,  when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base ,  who have aged considerably more than her .  the science might not be perfect ,  but it's presented in a pretty believable way ,  with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes ,  where noriko ,  kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series .   the animation ,  for a series made in the 80s ,  is definitely good .  the designs are retro 80s style of course ,  but it has it's charm .  animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice ,  although the costumes do betray  some of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest .  the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too ,  with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine ,  strong and vast .  the last episode was entirely done in black and white .  while it's generally believed  ( but not confirmed )  that this was done for budget reasons ,  it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series ,  which is suited perfectly for the latter part .   the music is very typical space opera fair .  too bombastic in places ,  very generic ,  and definitely not worth buying .  it does fit the series for the most part ,  but it can become quite annoying at times .  tanaka is not really a famous composer ,  and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half .  if you think 80s anime music ,  you will know what to expect .   as the series progresses ,  the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle ,  but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this .  step by step the drama will be toned down ,  and the battles will take the front row .  neither aspect is ever left completely out though .  with the last episode in sight ,  noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind ,  and with the last battle in sight ,  certain questions are presented to the audience ,  concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy ,  and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation .  while they are never answered later on ,  they still present some interesting food for thought .  the last episode is very epic ,  with a nice ,  but quite predictable ending ,  though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course .  again ,  it fits the series .   gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first ,  with alien invasions ,  huge battles ,  and some personal drama ,  and for the bigger part ,  it is .  but it is done exceptionally well for a change .  instead of going for a steady mix of former elements ,  six episodes long ,  gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism .  along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters ,  which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon .  the show is very tightly written ,  although it does tend to slip up at some points .  overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided .  overall ,  the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed ,  sometimes sad ,  sometimes heroic one .  it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre ,  but at least it bend them a little .  highly enjoyable anime classic ,  but not without flaws .   ***/*****
1	aim for the top !  gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it .  i totally loved this series ,  and to this day ,  it remains my favorite anime .  and while it was not gainax's first animated product ,  it was their first ova series .   mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970's sports drama aim for the ace  ( ace o nerae !  )  ,  gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 ,  when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father ,  who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with .  it is because of her father's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot .  but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters .  her friend ,  kazumi amano ,  even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot .  however ,  noriko's coach ,  koichiro ota ,  has faith in her .  and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot ,  for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko's father was killed .   other characters include jung-freud ,  a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to ,  smith toren ,  a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together ,  and kimiko higuchi ,  noriko's childhood friend .  kimiko's involvement is also of interest ,  as while noriko is off in space ,  kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life .  and because of the acts of time dilation ,  kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school .  by the end of the series ,  noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fifties .   all in all ,  this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation .  if you like hideaki anno's other shows ,  or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto's artwork ,  then give this show a chance .  it will grow on you .
1	terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt ,  good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines ,  well acted and well cast ,  tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
1	very entertaining ,  and a great cast as noted .  i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also ,  as is usually the case .  worth renting if you can find it ,  which has proved difficult for me .  also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name .
1	tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud .  the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself .   there are a few surprises .  as cynical as we are today ,  i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave ,  instead of his buddy's .  especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend' ,  when she first meets matt .  and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr .  allen's face ,  blinding him  ( interesting role by bruce dern )  .  wrrrooonnnnggg !  !  !  some of the other hollywood endings do happen ,  but the writing is so excellent ,  the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware .   and the music is out of this world .  taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley .  even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago ,  but at a club called ,  wonderfully ,  'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks .  i'll be watching it again ,  just to hear the music .  good thing i have the factotum sound track ,  so i can listen to that in the car .  watch both together ,  and you'll see how matt has matured .  .  .  . playing bar room characters in both .  now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc ,  he probably has great opportunity to do his studies .  great actor ,  just coming into his own .  he shows finely nuanced performances  .  .  . the good and the bad in his characters .  his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study ,  made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes .  he makes love ,  convincingly as well .  since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager ,  i wonder how that it  .  .  . making love to an actress you kinda grew up with .  adds conviction ,  i'll say that .
1	considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film .  the acting for the most part is great ,  although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best .  however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent .
1	what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be .  this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages .  particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago ,  which i still keep thinking about .  the back cover doesn't do this film justice ,  it's superb ,  and in my top-5 for sure .
1	star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways .  first ,  it's a fan made series ,  available only on the web ,  and it features mainly friends & neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to ,  as mickey & judy once put it ,  put on a show .  it's definitely friends & neighbors to ,  you can tell .  a lot of these people aren't the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen ,  or the youngest ,  or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they're walking on marbles some of them have thick accents ,  or simply don't seem to speak well in the first place ,  whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they're saying .  still ,  you have to admit ,  for everything these friends & neighbors have put together ,  it's actually fun to watch .  yes ,  some of the dialogue is hokey .  yes ,  it's a little odd  ( though admittedly a little cool too )  watching two starfleet males kiss  ( although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on .  )  yes ,  you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st : tos ,  tng ,  other shows and the movies ,  or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show .  okay .  we can get by that .  why ?  the graphics are first rate .  better than almost anything you've seen .  and sometimes ,  a show or two really stands out story-wise some of them are actually real tear-jerkers .   hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due .  it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude .  people ,  sets ,  costumes ,  graphics it's a huge effort on a lot of people's parts .  we watch ,  we return ,  and we thank them .
1	hidden frontiers-is more than fan fiction- it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing .  from a fun little fan project to now a well known net series ;  hidden frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it .  set in the late star trek :  next generation/ds9 and voyager time lines hidden frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other star trek series with set stories using a well developed characters ,  plots ,  and story arcs .  star trek hidden frontier has taken on social context stories that gene roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments - the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts sci-fi addicts know and love .  done in a  " green screen "  studio ;  hidden frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts .  the large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project .  inventive use of green screen technology ,  props ,  makes up and costumes work to make the hidden frontier worlds of star trek fun and believable .  hidden frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction ,  and thrived once they got there .  hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website ,  with interesting discussion forums ,  access to creative ,  production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat .  i highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch .
1	four teenage girlfriends drive to fort laurdale for spring break . unfortunately they get a flat tire in medley , georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . the local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins .  .  .  " shallow grave "  is a pleasant low-budget surprise . the cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . especially the second murder is pretty grim . the murderous sheriff isn't one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done . the subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting . 7 out of 10 .
1	this is short and to the point .  the story writing used for star trek :  hidden frontier is surprisingly good .  acting is all over the map ,  but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills .  it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-may 2007 .   i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics .  considering this is all-volunteer ,  for no profit ,  it is pretty amazing .   if this was being ranked as a professional production ,  i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets .  however ,  as a fan-based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts ,  this is in a league of its own .  for sheer volume ,  i don't think this has been matched .  congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire .
1	with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast .  nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work .  anyone heard of adobe after effects 7 ,  they should buy it get their keying better .   stories are well thought out ,  plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context .  but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode .  im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining  ( dont mind women )  .  anyway .  .  .  for a fan series this is good stuff .  with minor improvement in their green screen ,  brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning .  anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9 .
1	hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry's mission .  their focus on homosexuality ,  depression ,  war ,  and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies .  the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved ,  the stories are more complex ,  and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive .  in season 6 episode 1 ,  countermeasures ,  there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history .  the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting .  the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds ,  but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters .  there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know .  i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked !
1	i really enjoyed this one ,  and although the ending made me angry ,  i still give it 10 out of 10 .   four college girls  ( baltron ,  kelly ,  stahl and cadby )  are driving down to florida ,  on their way they meet 2 guys  ( turner ,  davis )  ,  they really add nothing to the plot ,  but are at least somewhat likable .  the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun ,  but they have car problems and never make it .  one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help ,  the other three stay by the car .   soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom ,  being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes .  soon she witnesses as a man  ( march )  strangles a woman ,  in terror the girl flees the area ,  she doesn't get very far ,  but manages to get lost .   her friends by the car go looking for her ,  they too go into the woods and run into the same man ,  one of them sees the dead woman ,  the man responds by shooting the girls head off ,  the other girl runs away ,  manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed .   eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested .  this is when i started getting mad ,  these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them .   they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell ,  the remaining friend manages to escape ,  but not without getting in dangerous situations .   this movie has nudity ,  good actresses ,  a shower scene imitating psycho ,  graphic violence towards women and solid story .  some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending ,  but over all ,  this is a great little unknown movie .
1	i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it .  i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view .  i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out .  i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job .  if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film .  the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
1	okay ,  so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way ,  but from the beginning ,  hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances ,  and have always been willing to mistakes they've made .  they advice people to see newer episodes first ,  so they can see just how good the show is ,  and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes .  the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen .    the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show ,  as the story lines go from strength to strength .  the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression ,  drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way ,  but that is what star trek is and was all about .  it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way ,  dealing with them subtly and smoothly .    yes ,  they have used some characters from trek history ,  but they have done them justice - characters like shelby ,  lefler and necheyev ,  vastly underused in the show ,  had a rebirth in the new frontier books ,  but they lost their sizzle after a while ,  when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi ,  and hf shows those characters in a completely different light ,  which serves them better .    the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved .  they release bloopers for every episode ,  so the fans can see what a laugh they have ,  because they are people doing it in their spare time ,  with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock !    what this series ,  now drawing to a close after 7 years ,  has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together ,  inspiring others to do the same .  hf will live for a long time after it ends ,  as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .
1	i kind of consider myself as the #1 fan of hidden frontier ,  seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well ,  not counting conventions ,  of course .  i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001 ,  and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with .   hidden frontier is the brainchild of rob caves and his self-made studio ,  areakt pictures ,  which operates out of the back room of his house .  while not as  " fancy "  as ,  say ,  the tos-based series new voyages  ( which sometimes gets some of the actors/writers from the original series ,  like walter koenig ,  aka mr .  chekov )  ,  rob and the cast and crew of hf manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called  " enterprise "  .  the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star trek's first openly gay character ,  corey aster  ( who was introduced in the second season )  ,  and his search to find a soul mate .  somewhere later in the series ,  he meets jorian zen ,  the excelsior's trill helm officer .  in the recent story lines with these two characters  ( warning :  major spoiler !  do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point !  )  ,  zen is joined to an exiled symbiont ,  causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with aster .  though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode ,   " beachhead "  ,  was just shown to hf fans in the chat room last night - i think that this relationship will endure ,  but only time will tell .   gene roddenberry created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles .  rob caves created hidden frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is .  as the previous comment stated ,  i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10 ,  but it will have to suffice .  although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek :  the next generation - i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode .
1	this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans ,  and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting ,  and it's characters show realistic depth and dimension .  the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking .  while it's first season might be a little shaky ,  it's final few are well thought out and well shot .  some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise ,  but these fans don't take no for an answer .  i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike ,  10/10 hidden frontier crew .   make it so .  .  .
1	nicely done ,  and along with  " new voyages "  it's a great continuation !  fab to see james cawley in the latest episode  " vigil "  check it out !    i like the growing characterisation ,  and think we have good replacements for the tv actors in a fan-produced piece .  this show manages to capture the feel quite well ,  as they state on the ste ,  it has improved over the years with experience and i hope with some more experience ,  a strong script editor ,  and a pick-up in timing and cgi that hf will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is !   good work to all concerned !    ( i have a huge soft spot for lefler & mcfarland  ( great acting )  ,  although i'm a bit tired of  " lefler's laws "  .  enough already !  shelby's great  ( if a little uptight )  and it's cool she got the ship .  commodore ian's nice  ( like fred flintstone )  ,  but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself .  the doc ,  counselor ,  and rawlins are right on the money in my eyes ,  as is the wonderful nechayev  ( what a beautiful accent - a real russian !   ( well ,  i'm guessing rene hails from the czech rep .  )   it gets my vote ,  and the cgi is kewl .  some of the greenscreen's obvious ,  but on a small budget whaddayagonndo ?   really glad i found it !    ( ok ,  some of the acting isn't great but it's fan-made and is therefore allowed to be variable - sorry cmm .  cole )   the gay material is layed on too thick  ( graham norton'd be embarrassed )  .  trek doesn't pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging ?  it's not necessary to showpiece someone's sexuality to this extent - i hope they tone it down & let aster & zen be people not tokens - i don't treat my gay friends any differently ,  they're just regular guys .   musically it's a mixed bag .  i can tell its all stock trek ost stuff and works most of the time ,  but timing can fall flat now & then  ( the end of  " worst fears part 2 "  misses the crunch ,  and the edit .  love the fact they use the  " galaxy quest "  music !   i certainly can't wait for more !  !  dazza   " never give up ,  never surender !  "   viva les frontieres
1	for the record ,  i am not affiliated with the production in any way .   hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date .  over 7 seasons  ( this is the last )  they have produced some 50 or so episodes .   this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy .   by their own admission ,  the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects ,  green screen work and acting all improve .   i did find it difficult to  " dip into "  so started from the beginning and watched all the way through .  hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set .  characters and  " relatives "  from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories ,  sometimes improving on the characters over the original .   the whole experience includes an excellent web site ,  blooper reels ,  a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat .   if you are looking for high definition ,  high budget productions ,  this is probably not for you .   if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think ,  this is the one .
1	star trek :  hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film ,  done completely for the love of the series ,  and a must watch for fans of trek .  the production quality is extremely high for a fan film ,  although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it .  this doesn't take away from the overall experience however .  the cgi ships are fantastic ,  as well as the space battle scenes .  .  .  on the negative side ,  i could tell in the earlier episodes  ( and even occasionally in the newer ones )  that some of the actors/actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles ,  but once again ,  this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek .  the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here ,  and ,  as a whole , i would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space 9 .
1	hidden frontier is a fan made show ,  in the world of star trek .  the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta-quadrant  .  it has some characters from the official star trek shows ,  but most of them are original to the show .  the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships ,  which gives it opportunities the official shows don't have .  the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy ,  which characters in shows with only one ship doesn't have .  the show has good computer animation of spaceships ,  but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors .  not all the actors are equally good ,  but most do fine .  the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes .  that is a bit more like in babylon 5 ,  than in most official star trek shows .  hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using .  all in all i enjoyed watching it .
1	hidden frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based star trek fan series .  while the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like starship exeter ,  or new voyages ,  hidden frontier concentrates largely on story ,  and in that regard it does very well indeed .   hidden frontier has no physical sets ;  instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen ,  and the backgrounds inserted digitally .  one of hidden frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced .  one of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming ,  instead of in post-production .  while this does save a great deal of time ,  it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production ,  though it still serves its purpose .    while it may not be everyone's cup of tea ,  hidden frontier is well worth a shot ,  though you might be best to start off watching the third season ,  since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride .
1	low budget brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star ,  becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much .  good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before .  several scenes are a bit hysterical and o'connor's voice sounds a lot like mini mouse !  she disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art !  a must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though .
1	i agree with all the accolades ,  i went through a box of tissues watching this film .  it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way .   the question i'm about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals .  i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats ,  and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous .   this is the age of  " no animals were hurt in the production of this move .  "  iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation .  was it possible to fake these animal deaths ?  or were these animals slaughtered for art ?
1	i acquired this ,  one of my all-time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual ,  during viewing ,  the whole thing just blew me away .   i am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears ,  especially the  " will you "  track .  it's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth .  this rates second best to quadrophenia  ( which also starred phil daniels )  .   a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which i grew up .  the ending is so sad ,  for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby .   i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing ,  i can watch it over and over again and never be bored ,  simply for the soundtrack alone .   hazel ,  sorry to hear about your dad darling .  god bless you all .  xx
1	anyone interested in pop music ,  and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies ,  should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once .  the movie ,  about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world ,  captures the times perfectly ,  from the overt sexism ,  rough economic times ,  social upheaval ,  to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism/new romanticism .  the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled  ( there really has been nothing new since 1980 )  .  this was a dazzling time ,  and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape ,  and does both extremely well .
1	i first saw  " breaking glass "  when it was released in england in 1980 .  . i loved it then and having just caught it in august 2005 on a canadian station it still is great .  the only thing i regret is i can't find the sound track or the dvd in the stores ?  ?  .  .  . anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company .  but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time ,  hazel/kate had something to say about 80's britain .  . actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being  " thatcher "  and what she was doing to the country at the time .  please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry !
1	one of my best films ever ,  maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts ,  but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming phil daniels not sure about his latest project eastenders  !  !  excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the uk soaps today exp :  carver out of the bill ,  the more i watch it the more of them i spot ,  well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video ,  don't forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head mochanian style .  .  .  . enjoy
1	i first saw  " breaking glass "  in 1980 ,  and thought that it would be one of the  " movie classics "  .  this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers .  this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry .  i can't wait for it to be available on dvd .
1	breaking glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once .  it is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible .  looking at some of today's 'search for a star' style tv shows on both in the uk and abroad i am always reminded of this film .  though not an expert on the subject ,  the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there .  this film predates these shows though the effect seems the same .  after getting rid of her manager ,  played quite brilliantly by phil daniels ,  slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out .  you potential stars of tomorrow .  .  .  .  watch this and beware  !  !  !
1	i first saw the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out .  it blew my little head away ,  i was only 16 and it was the first new wave music i'd heard ,  having been a strictly folky ,  classical kid growing up .  the music mesmerized me ,  as did hazel o'connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances ,  and phil daniels' tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart .  but i think my favorite character was jonathan pryce's drugged out sax player .  he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic ,  he just begged for sympathy .  favorite scenes ,  the performance when the lights went out ,  and the love scene on the train .   okay ,  so the movie isn't the rose !  but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80's ,  exploding with rebellious youth ,  looking for a way out of the dole queue .  i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere i found when i was there .   if you get a chance to ,  see it .  it is a great movie ,  with some wonderful performances ,  and the music will blow you away .
1	illudere  ( to delude )  comes from latin verb 'ludere'  ( to play )  ,  so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent  (  !  )  activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history ,  whatever it may be ;  and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty ,  the raw material of any relationship ,  from the personal to the social ;  after ,  many years ago ,  i was able to finish the book it was a revelation !  at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing  ( i really started to love le carre after that novel )  .  the main character is not wavering at all :  he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love ,  or is he not ?  after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama' ;  there is no game left ,  there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way ,  or both .  there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service' ,  or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case .  the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels :  the actors are excellent ,  as are the locations and sets ;  of course the script here is brilliantly adapted .  be warned though ,  even if someone may find it laughable ,  the after taste is bitter .
1	i have just watched the whole 6 episodes on dvd .  the acting throughout is excellent - no question .  there was not quite enough action for me i must say .  no real suspense as such ,  just plenty of first class character development .  nothing like tinker tailor in terms of  " whodunnit "  .  if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you .  peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent .   the film portrayed the life of a traitor .  a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things .  as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man .  pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him  ( wife ,  son ,  mentor )  .  pym is fatally damaged by his father's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away .  he has no real love or loyalty in him .   heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series .  very well done though .
1	having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go ,  one can do nothing but doff one's hat - a pure masterpiece ,  which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley ,  has quite different qualities .   in the minis about smiley ,  it is alex guiness ,  as smiley ,  who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him ,  one can say .   here it is ensemble and story that's important ,  as the lead actor ,  played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes ,  isn't charismatic at all .    egan just plays a guy called magnus pym ,  who by lying ,  being devious and telling people what they like to hear ,  is very well liked by everyone ,  big and small .  the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex ,  his czech handler .   never have the machinery behind a spy ,  and/or traitor ,  been told better !  after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor .  his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy' ,  as his czech handler calls him .    and ,  by following his life ,  we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path ,  once you've veered off it .  he trundles on ,  even if he never get anything economic out of it ,  except promotion by his mi5 spy masters .  everyone's happy ,  as long as the flow of faked information continues !    magnus's father ,  played wonderfully by ray mcanally ,  is a no-good con-man ,  who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money .  in later years it is his son who has to bail him out ,  again and again .  but by the example set by his dad and uncle ,  who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison ,  and his mom is sent off to an asylum ,  magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving ,  not telling the truth .  at first he overdoes it a bit ,  but quickly learn to tell the right lies ,  and to be constant ,  not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad .   his czech handler alex ,  expertly played by rüdiger weigang ,  creates ,  with the help of magnus ,  a network of non-existing informants ,  which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years ,  and years ,  just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned ,  liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men .   the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully ,  and most of them are more charismatic than the older ,  little more cynic ,  and tired ,  pym ,  played by egan .  but you buy the difference easily ,  as that is often the way we change through life ,  from enthusiasm to sorrow ,  or indifference .   indeed well worth the money !
1	as a fan of author john le carre i've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them .  i found this 1987 adaptation of le carre's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect .  i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries ,  a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama .   peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym ,  the perfect spy of the title .  carrying on in the long tradition of le carre's strong main characters ,  pym is also quite possibly the best .  egan plays pym  ( who in fact contains many shades of author le carre )  as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming  " a perfect spy "  .  egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run ,  if not from others then from himself .  egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone .   surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast .  ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pym's con man father rick who  ( as le carre has said )  is based strongly on the author's own father .  mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pym's life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming  " a perfect spy "  .  in fact if it wasn't for mcanally's performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career .   the rest of the supporting is excellent as well .  from caroline john as pym's mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to rüdiger weigang as the young pym's friend turned controller to jane booker as pym's wife the supporting cast is fantastic .  special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym  ( jonathan haley ,  nicholas haley and benedict taylor )  who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter egan .   the production values of the miniseries are strong as well .  as the miniseries adaptations of tinker ,  tailor ,  soldier ,  spy and smiley's people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format .  the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards .  the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries .  yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script .   screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently .  the novel was largely  ( at least in its early parts )  autobiographical in that pym's early life echoed much of john le carre's life .  the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to  " a perfect spy "  .  never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage .  if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight ,  fist fight ,  or james bond style car chase this would be the proof .  while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it .   though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention spans here is a must see .  from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see .  it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that .  it is also a trip down what john le carre has called  " the secret path "  :  the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive .  as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy isn't to be missed .
1	this is my second time through for a perfect spy .  i watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it .  i like it still .  it's natural that it gets compared to the beeb's other big le carre' series ,  tinker tailor soldier spy .  tinker tailor focuses on the  " game "  spies play ;  perfect spy gives us the other axis - what kind of person a spy is .  there are a number of themes that these movies share ,  along with others in the genre .   ambiguity - moral ,  sexual ,  interpersonal - which creates a multidimensional space of true vs .  false ,  inside vs .  outside ,  love vs .  responsibility .  in a way ,  these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect -  " backstabbed "  in its various nuances .   the theme of fathers and father-figures is also important .  one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick ,  the main character magnus' perhaps ersatz father .  throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed .  a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he's been toppled ,  who seems impervious to what others think of him ,  asks magnus each time they meet ,   " do you love your old man ?  "  and never ,   " do you love me ?  "  maybe it says this somewhere else ,  but a perfect spy is a love story .   another theme is that of malignancy .  the nature of the business is to turn others - turn them against their government ,  against their friends and associates ,  turn them against their values and beliefs .  in each of the le carre' movies i have seen ,  the spy who came in from the cold ,  looking glass war ,  tinker tailor soldier spy ,  smiley's people ,  and a perfect spy ,  turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy .    finally ,  not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot ,  or perhaps two shots bookending the story .  violence ,  torture ,  cruelty are always just beneath the surface .  we see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects le carre''s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass .   if you haven't seen the films above ,  and you enjoy a perfect spy ,  you are in for a treat .  i'd also recommend the sandbagger series  ( yorkshire tv )  ,  the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity .  the ipcress file and burial in berlin are nice ,  though light weight .  for political intrigue try a very british coup ,  house of cards and yes ,  minister/yes ,  prime minister .    if only a brit would set his hand to making the three kingdoms - there would be a film with intrigue and complexity .
1	this is an extremely long movie ,  which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting ,  but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies .   if you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching ,  because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak .  if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym ,  the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country ,  his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people .   there isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story ,  not one loyal ,  'moral' personality to sympathise with .  but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable .   i really enjoyed it in the end .  well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character .
1	it's been a long time since i saw this mini-series and i am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time .    most of the components of 'a perfect spy' ,  the adaptation of lecarré's finest novel ,  in my opinion ,  are top-drawer .  outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay ,  the latter written by arthur hopcraft who was also ,  i believe ,  the screenwriter for 'tinker tailor soldier spy' with alec guinness a few years before .   the actors are mostly very good ,  some superb ,  like alan howard's jack brotherhood and ray mcanally's ricky pym .  peter egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle .  the passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done .  so much so that i wondered exactly how old peter egan was at the time of filming .  the only jolt comes after the character of magnus pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named benedict taylor to those of a noticeably too-old peter egan ,  just fresh out of oxford .  but this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole .   egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be  " upset "  emotionally ,  ie cry .  none of the actors have a very easy time with these moments ,  aside from the wonderful frances tomelty who plays peggy wentworth for all she's worth and steals the episode with ease .   jane booker is annoying as mary pym .  she has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife ,  which mary pym is .  rüdiger weigang is splendid as axel ,  amusing ,  ironic and brilliant .  i also enjoyed sarah badel's camp turn as the baroness .   the british view of americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes .  when the yanks have come abroad to confab with bo brammell  ( head of mi6 )  the american contingent are portrayed as empty-headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the dictionary and spiced them liberally with american jargon and psycho babble ,  much to the bemused scorn of the english .    the humor and sadness are subtly blended .  lecarré has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy ,  yet wistful ,  atmosphere of the original .   not a perfect production  ( what is ?  )  and yet the best of the lecarré adaptations to reach film or television to date .    highly recommended to all spy-thriller lovers and especially lecarré fans .  dvd available from acorn .
1	this is without doubt my favourite le carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for .  i read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but i believe this misses the point .  all le carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception .  it is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set .  betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody .  pym upbringing is so close to my own that i find it chilling watching .  peter egan is in his finest role and the late lamented ray mcanally is unbelievably good .  even the smallest roles played by such as andy de la tour ,  tim healy and jack ellis are spot on .  this cast is a theatre impresario's dream .  the story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason .  all my sympathies lie with magnus pym and his sole  ( non sexual )  love for poppy  ( rüdiger weigang-as wonderful as always .  his only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals .  outstanding !  rent it ,  buy it .  love it .
1	without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre ,  exquisitely transformed into a classic film .  performances by peter egan  ( magnus pym ,  the perfect spy )  ,  rudiger weigang  ( axel ,  real name alexander hampel ,  magnus' czech intelligence controller )  ,  ray mcanally  ( magnus' con-man father )  and alan howard  ( jack brotherhood ,  magnus' mentor ,  believer and british controller )  ,  together with the rest of the characters ,  are so perfect and natural ,  the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award .  even the small parts ,  such as major membury ,  are performed to perfection .  it says a lot for the power of the performances ,  and the strength of the characters in the novel that ,  despite the duplicity of magnus ,  one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of u . s .  intelligence .  i have read the book at least a dozen times ,  and watched the movie almost as many times ,  and continue to be mesmerized by both .  if i had one book to take on a desert island ,  a perfect spy would be the choice above all others .
1	erotic cinema of the 1970's was tame compared to the triple x romps of today ,  which is good .  because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes .  of course ,  i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little .  plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods ,  but it's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil's plaything .  but if you don't care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex ,  then this isn't the movie for you .  however ,  i did enjoy it and i give it .  .  . 7 stars .
1	spoilers !  classic 70's sex trash !  the swedish gal  ( helga )  was what made this movie so great .  she was beautiful ,  but what really got to me was how sexual she was .  she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film .  her best scenes were when she was ,  er ,  stimulating herself .  whenever she was on screen ,  i became transfixed .   also ,  the doctor julia  ( sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film )  was very interesting visually .  although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia ,  she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes  ( especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt )  also grabbed my attention unmercilessly .  you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid ;  i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time .  classic stuff !
1	michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name ,  including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out .  iphigenia ,  however ,  is a highlight .  adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides ,  it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel .  the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film ,  with the emphasis placed on the simple story :  in supplication to the gods ,  king agamemnon  ( kostas kazakos ) is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia  ( tatiana papamoschou )  ,  much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae  ( irene papas )  .  kazakos and papas are both outstanding ,  but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen ,  blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game .  strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .
1	well ,  if you are looking for a great mind control movie ,  this is it .  no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control ,  and naked .  marie forsa ,  as the busty helga ,  is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn't .  one wishes they made more movies like this one .
1	well the story is a little hard to follow the first time ,  but that's only because of all the bare breasted '70s painted-up vampire/witches dancing to the bongo drums .  this of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies .  and there are some very interesting candles and uses for them .  and for girl on girl action ,  vampiric or not .  .  . this movie just rocks !  !  !
1	this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w . sarno . it features plenty of soft core sex , really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women . the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well-made . marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie-it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body . sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies . a must see for fans of sexploitation !
1	the devil's plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production - and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats ,  it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste .   this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle ,  that want to resurrect their previously murdered  " leader "  .  in order to do so ,  the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood ,  too .  when a doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires .  .  . but they may not be as helpless as they seem .  .  .   the devil's plaything is a pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze .  lots of nudity - including some full-frontal ,  some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course ,  lesbo-bloodsucking .  .  . but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards .  some pretty hot women in this one ,  would have benefited from some more explicit sex ,  but i guess ya can't have it all .  also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore ,  being that it is a vampire film ,  but i think the purpose of the devil's plaything was more to showcase skin ,  not blood .  still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget .  worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking .  7/10
1	this is an excellent show !  i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this .  there are many  " facts "  in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well ,  in a way that is unforgettable .   mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students .  use of live actors performing  " skits "  is also very entertaining .    i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down .
1	this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen .  this is a must see for anyone over the age of 16 .  this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning .  i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance .  if mr wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia dome to hold all the people who will want to see it .  i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series .  it would have an amazing following
1	i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this .  but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is .  this hbo special features him teaching  " american history "  to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal .  he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u . s .  but some other parts of the world .  this documentary/comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true .   i enjoyed how mr .  wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting .  i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her beliefs .
1	i recently watched this ,  but when it started i had no idea what the concept was about ,  what the topic was .  .  .  .  . in short - i had no idea what it was .  was it a documentary ,  was it a comedy routine .  .  .  .  . well ,  it was both .   it started a little slow ,  but i think that's because i had absolutely no idea what type of program i was viewing .  but it quickly sucked me in .  the episode i watched had robert wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history .  mainly how we  ( american's )  learn history that isn't really true - and how we got to learn what we did .  he did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained ,  and interested .  i actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be .   i would love to see this picked up as a series for hbo .  i believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are  " taught "  in the same type of manner as this episode .
1	robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan ,  new york .   he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known .  i would like to see much more of this show .  it is very entertaining .  mr .  wuhl uses examples and  " show and tell "  to get his points across .  he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere !  henry wadsworth longfellow used revere's name because it sounded better .   i've watched robert wuhl for many years ,  from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through  " arli$$ "  on hbo .  he's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian ,  but he's an excellent teacher !  i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show .  it is well worth your time .
1	jane porter's former love interest harry holt ( neil hamilton )  and his friend martin  ( paul cavanagh )  come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the  " elephant's graveyard "  first seen in tarzan ,  the ape man .  .  . only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions .  .  . namely jane .  will tarzan stand for that ?  not likely  ( in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the  " elephant's graveyard "  )  and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party  ( including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead ) is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions .  . will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time ?   this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up .  the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously .
1	ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect ?  well ,  unfortunately  " convention city "  is lost ,  so well just have to watch  " tarzan and his mate "  to find out .  for 1934 ,  there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh .  just look at jane's nude swim .  while tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else ,  this picture proves that the series was originally very adult .  over seventy years later ,  it is still as sexy as it was when it came out .   in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature ,  it is a superb and exciting adventure story .  i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s ,  but there are few from the genre i'd call great films .   " tarzan and his mate "  is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre .  the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today .  also ,  the animals are all too cool  ( espescially the apes throwing boulders )  .  the acting won't win any major awards soon ,  but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture .  the film is once again stolen by cheetah ,  the smartest monkey in the jungle .  one of the most entertaining examples of pre-code hollywood out there .
1	my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia .  my name is eugenia so i thought ok ,  lets see what this is .  i am so glad i stayed on the channel .  what a wonderful ,  wonderful story .  drama ,  sadness ,  some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had .  i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over .  give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did .  i have even gotten my children  ( 27 ,  25 ,  20 and 17 )  to enjoy it .  it starts slow ,  however ,  the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story .  watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos .
1	make no mistake ,  maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever ,  and there will never be one more gorgeous .  she is visually stunning .  that aside ,  it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film .  this is a great film .  it not only has the classic tarzan aura ,  but also the feel of the continuing saga .  we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory ,  one of them in love with jane ,  the other ,  a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history . and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic .  there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted .  however ,  the africans are depicted as individuals ,  and at the end ,  two even become more heroic than the white hunters ,  and stand out as such .  in fact ,  the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters .  the finale ,  also ,  is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie .  the great lion attack has never been duplicated ,  and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction .  if i left anything out ,  it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it .  but it is everything you could want in a movie .
1	i only saw iphigenia once ,  almost 30 years ago ,  but it has haunted me since .   one sequence particularly stays in mind ,  and could only have been fashioned by a great director ,  as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is .   the context :  the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon's shoulders .  an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas ,  endangering his great expedition to troy .  he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships .  he initially resists ,  but comes around ,  and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors ,  achilles .   clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive ,  find out about the sacrifice ,  and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance .  meanwhile ,  the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent ,  dishonorable way .  he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her .   the shot :  the camera circles the two young people ,  without looking directly at each other .  they bemoan their fate ,  and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war .  suddenly ,  they gaze at each other and ,  for one moment ,  we feel both their power and beauty ,  and the unstated--except by the camera--irony that in another time ,  another place ,  they perhaps could love each other and be married .  it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant .   what direction !  what camera !  what storytelling !
1	tarzan and his mate ( 1934 )  was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid .  it sounded boring .  now i have seen it .  i have seen the ape man ( 1932 )  about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive .  it's a remarkable movie .  it's almost flawless .  tarzan and his mate ( 1934 )  however ,  falters .  it's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own .  the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great .  big budget expensive .  tarzan himself is co-starring .  jane dominates .  she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead .  well .  she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant .  she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father .  forever .  the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle .  stupid ?  later someone founds it in the river .  well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead .  some cheap drama .  the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone .  she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away ( to england )  .  stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is ,  how hard he is to kill .  the caravan is leaving and jane go along .  again a pothole .  she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more ,  to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband .  she could be smart .  she could dive where they found the floating bracelet ,  check the banks for traces .  she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's .  picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane .  she could talk to the apes ,  and so on .  if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable .  jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down .  and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with  " i blame myself as much as you "  .  a punishment for being vane perhaps ?  nonsense .  struggle ,  a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate .  still .  this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep .  just lean back and enjoy .  it's tarzan and jane for god sake .
1	108 :  tarzan and his mate  ( 1934 )  - released 4/20/1934 ,  viewed 8/6/08 .   john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa .  bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas .  births :  ralph nader ,  gloria steinem ,  alan arkin ,  richard chamberlain .   doug :  after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man , ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film ,  'tarzan and his mate , ' was the best in the series .  it's true .  i got a huge kick out of this movie .  johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging ,  animal dueling wild super-hero ,  and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane  ( who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here )  .  in my review for 'ape man , ' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming ,  but she's redeemed herself for me here .  make no mistake :  o'sullivan is the star of this movie ,  and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast .  she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan ,  she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals ,  and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets .  she's even got her own jungle scream now .  the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible .  she's totally got him trained .  cheeta is quite charming as well ,  taking drags off of martin's cigarette .  the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals ,  especially lions ,  crocodiles ,  and rhinos .  the effects ,  though always visible ,  are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely .  oh ,  and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene .  all i can say is :  yes ,  she is naked .  very exciting stuff .   kevin :  wow .  just wow .  when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure ,  nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate . ' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass ,  violent and risqué jungle epic .  i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does .  you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved ,  or animal rights-approved for that matter .  the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies .  and after t&j enter the picture ,  there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims .  see it for yourself if you don't believe me .  i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film .  in the first film ,  jane seemed like a walking contradiction ,  like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that .  but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema .  although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams ,  she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued .  her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living  ( relatively )  comfortably in the jungle for a year .  i watched this with my mom ,  and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan  " trained ,  "  as jeff foxworthy put it .  she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call .  although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film ,  there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs .  predator battles that are performed  ( mostly )  for real .  that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around .  **spoiler** the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing .  although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious ,  i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again .  **end spoiler** one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth ,  hairless bod and over-styled coif .  other than that ,  this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed .   last film :  it happened one night  ( 1934 )  .  next film :  twentieth century  ( 1934 )  .
1	a year after losing gorgeous jane parker  ( maureen o'sullivan )  to love rival tarzan ,  hunter harry holt  ( neil hamilton )  returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart .  mixing business with pleasure ,  he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment ,  tarzan's stomping ground .   accompanied by his slimy ,  womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers ,  harry finally arrives at his destination  ( having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes )  only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller ,  and worse still ,  that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard .   nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile .  of course ,  tarzan isn't deadonly wounded ;  after being nursed back to health by cheetah  (  !  )  ,  he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked holt's expedition .   tarzan and his mate ,  the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words ,  is often cited by fans as the best of the series ;  although i slightly prefer the original ,  i can definitely understand the film's popularity :  it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences !  the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes ,  and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout ,  there's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy  ( despite o'sullivan's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double ,  the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin ,  even threatening to do a 'sharon stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side !  )  .   the film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile ,  and the spectacular finalé where jane is attacked by lions and natives ,  but is rescued by her beau ,  his monkey pals ,  and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode  ( once again ,  the violence is surprisingly nasty at times ,  although as far as i am concerned ,  there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film )  .  cheetah also has his fair share of excitement ,  dodging rhinos ,  crocs ,  and big cats ,  riding on tarzan's back as he crosses a river ,  and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride .   like it's predecessor ,  tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection ,  a few laughable monkey suits ,  more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins ,  and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film .  if anything ,  they make it even more fun !   8 . 5 out of 10 ,  rounded up to 9 for imdb .
1	one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed  ( and graphic )  .   picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man ,  niel hamilton's holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory .  his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan .  before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition .  when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded .  they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire .  eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures .   infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence  ( its graphic even by todays standards .  it probably would get a pg 13 )  and to remove all hint of nudity ,   ( there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity ,  it was only recently restored )  .  its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv .  as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic ,  touching ,  action filled and everything else that a movie should be .  its an amazing film by almost any standard .  best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure ,  one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it ,  but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film .  its an amazing thing .   i really like this film a great deal .   if there are any flaws to the film ,  its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well .  the rear screen is often very obvious ,  there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing .  however on almost every other level this film is top notch .   you really owe it to yourself to see this .  make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time .  this is one of the great adventures .
1	i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd  ( fully restored editions )  & i never tire of watching them .  my personal favorite is  " tarzan and his mate "  ,  due entirely  ( well almost entirely )  to maureen o'sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front .  before anyone claims that a - it wasn't really her ,  or b - it wasn't really what it looks like ,  let me say that i have watched it numerous time ,  in high zoom mode ,  and trust me .  .  . it is her ,  and she is completely naked underneath that costume .  .  . several times ,  especially during the lion attack at the end ,  careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia .  .  . there is no mistake about that at all .  as to the swimming scene being a body double in a  " skin "  suit ,  yes ,  it is a double ,  but she is not wearing any  " skin "  suit or anything else .  .  . again ,  slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it .  now ,  that controversy out of the way ,  let's move on the actual movie .  .  . i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly .  .  . the action sequences were simply great ,  although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino ,  weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion .  .  . the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio & us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which .  don't complain too much though ,  remember that 90% of all films is phony anyway ,  so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn ,  some cold beer ,  and a fresh pack of smokes .  .  . a sexy and willing girlfriend/wife isn't out of line either .  .  . lol .  oh .  .  . one final word about nudity .  .  . at the very beginning ,  while the white hunters are speaking dialogue ,  keep your eyes on the background extras .  .  . there are several good shots of nude african girls  ( obviously shot on location )  behind them .  one more thing ,  the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's .  .  . that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then .  shaft hadn't even been thought about at that time ,  nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history .  safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads .  .  . and tiny's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane .  as a matter of fact ,  it wasn't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so .
1	hard to believe ,  perhaps ,  but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code .  yes indeed ,  priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin .   i'm not making this up .  they had several reasons ,  as follows :   item :  jane likes sex .  she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter .  she stretches sensuously ,  and with a coquettish look she says  " tarzan ,  you've been a bad boy !  "  so they've not only been having sex ,  they've been having kinky sex !  a few years later ,  under the hays code ,  people  ( especially women )  weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex .   item :  jane prefers a guileless ,  if wise and resourceful ,  savage  ( tarzan )  to a civilized ,  respectable nine-to-five man  ( holt )  .  when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london ,  she wavers a bit ;  when holt tries to kill tarzan ,  and holt and jane both believe he's dead ,  she wavers a lot .  but when she realizes her man is very much alive ,  the attractions of civilization vanish for her .  and why not ?  tarzan's and jane's relationship is egalitarian :  he lacks the  " civilized "  insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as  " the head of his wife "  .  to boot ,  he lacks many more  " civilized "  hangups ,  for example jealousy .  when holt and his buddy arrive ,  tarzan greets them both cordially ,  knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame .  when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph ,  tarzan drops out of a tree ,  and draws his knife .  jealous ?  nope .  he's merely cautious toward the weird music machine ,  since he's never seen one before .  once it's explained ,  he's cool .   item :  civilized holt is dirty minded .  savage tarzan is innocently sexy .  as jane slips into holt's lamplit tent ,  holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress .  by contrast ,  after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off ,  kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her ,  there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema :  the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet .  ( the scene was filmed in three versions--clothed ,  topless and nude--the scene was cut prior to the film's release ,  but the nude version is restored in the video now available .  )  and when jane emerges ,  and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease ,  jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of  " civilized "  men and their hangups .  where is the  " universal prurience "  so dear to the hearts of seminarians ?  nowhere ,  that's where .  another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful .    item :  the notion that man is the crown of creation ,  and animals are here only for man's use and comfort ,  takes a severe beating .  holt and his buddy want to be guided to the  " elephant graveyard "  so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home .  they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard .  you ,  reader ,  are thinking  " fat chance !  "  and you're right .  he's shocked .  he exclaims  " elephants sleep !  "  which to him explains everything .  jane explains tarzan's feelings ,  which the two  " gentlemen "  find ridiculous .    item :  jane ,  the ex-civilized woman ,  is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies .  holt and buddy blow it ,  and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals .  it is jane who maintains her cool .  while the boys panic ,  she takes charge ,  barks orders at them and passes out the rifles .   item :  jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath .   ( the original idea was for her to be topless ,  with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples ,  which indeed is the case in one brief scene .  )   lastly ,  several men of the cloth complained because the film was called  " tarzan and his mate "  rather than  " tarzan and his wife .  "  no comment !   of course ,  tarzan ,  who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends ,  comes to the rescue ,  routs the white hunters ,  and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came .  the end .   so there you have it .  an utterly subversive film .  like all the other films about complex and interesting women  ( see ,  e . g .  ,  possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey )  which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code .    the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell .  a nice touch ,  which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions .   let's hear it for artistic freedom ,  feminist jane ,  and sex .
1	tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle .  some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization .  but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave .  one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back .  .  . even if that means killing tarzan .   this is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original .   " tarzan ,  the ape man "  of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged .  this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult .  there is tons of blatant racism  ( a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares )  but this was 1934 .  there's also plenty of blood ,  gore and violence  ( for a 1934 movie )  and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude !  there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and  ( it's implied )  they sleep together and have sex--without being married .  this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme .   that aside ,  the movie is well-directed ,  very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement .  seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too .  i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan .  everybody else is ok .   this is easily the best weismuller--o'hara tarzan out there .  well worth seeing but not for kids !
1	the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller .  the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again .  just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role .  if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference .  . you are missing a real treat .  doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making ,  makeup set designs .  .  . no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did .  he was and is tarzan .
1	in the opinion of several of my friends and family members ,  including myself ,  this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies .  johnny weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series .  it definitely rates a  " 10 "  in my collection of films .
1	a very interesting entertainment ,  with the charm of the old movies .  tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it ,  and we all enjoy with him his success . the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills  ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout )
1	although the recent re-telling of part of homer's epic  " troy "  with brad pitt was entertaining once ,   " iphigenia "  with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking .  unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity .  a chance encounter with this film on one of directv's many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems .  there is no glitter or  " bling "  in this movie ,  just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil .  i think even homer ,  if he really existed ,  would be proud of this telling .   jlh
1	this splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm .  it is a first-class adventure for many reasons ,  i suggest--fine photography ,  strong imaginative qualities ,  a delightful cast ,  good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline .  johnny weissmuller plays tarzan ,  a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation ;  but he is honest ,  loyal ,  brave and very courageous ,  and he needs to be during this narrative .  as jane parker ,  his wife who had been jane porter in the novels ,  maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively ,  as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality .  the effect of the lighting ,  the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual .  this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back-lot which really works .  the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed ;  but into their idyll come people searching from them ,  emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated .  one is harry holt ,  still in love with her ,  who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him ;  the gown and perfumes interest her ,  but she refuses to leave tarzan .  tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals ,  in scenes that look like a humanized king king .  the group claim to want to hunt animals ,  and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping ;  but at some point ,  the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds .  tarzan is shot ,  left for dead ;  and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous  " elephant's graveyard "  .  but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions .  tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call ;  in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene ,  he saves jane and what is left of the expedition ,  who return home little richer but much wise ,  as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband .  the film was directed by set-design wizard cedric gibbons ,  and quite beautifully too .  his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film , which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish .  neil hamilton is a very good harry ,  paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad .  forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally .  an unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well .  recommended .
1	this was the second of the series of 6  " classic tarzan "  movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane .   as usual ,  this was a wonderful film in this series ;  and perhaps stands out as an  " in between "  film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s .  as such ,  it displayed good pace ,  though not as good as subsequent films .  likewise ,  the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series .  the stock i saw was of uneven quality ,  containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes .  the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here .  on the other hand ,  there is one scene ,  very early on ,  in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up ,  showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle ,  was really almost modern in its style ,  and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie .   regarding plot ,  one interesting feature here was jane's near-fickleness and inconstancy ,  when she was being subject to martin's flirtations .  the kiss  and jane's stunned ,  and partly guilty ,  reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films .  compare ,  for example ,  in tarzan finds a son !  jane's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family .  later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong .  here ,  nothing quite so explicit ,  but we have jane  " returning "  to the jane parker of yesteryear ,  and in an almost repentant series of actions ,  stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan .   there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing .   for one thing ,  the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here ,  as later ,  a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death .  this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience .   i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards .   there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure :  tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants' graveyard ;  tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo ,  and then nursed to health by the apes ;  cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment ;  cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log .  the final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees .  jane ,  showing us that she is truly of tarzan's world now ,  quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away .   the final series of scenes is splendid :  suddenly tarzan is on the scene ,  flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions ,  and summoning the elephants to the rescue !  that final cry of tarzan in triumph ,  holding a happy jane in his arms ,  with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them ,  is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane .   all in all ,  this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie .  i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone .
1	" tarzan and his mate "  ,  the second of mgm's tarzan pictures ,  picks up a year after the events of  " tarzan the ape man "  .  tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle ,  and harry holt  ( one of the expeditioners in the first film )  returns ,  this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable martin arlington ,  in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard .  naturally ,  a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way .   the first film romanticized everything--the jungle ,  adventure ,  romance itself ,  wild animals ,  and even death .  the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences ,  but a more serious tone underlies the action .  the characters dare to ask questions like :  what if something happened to tarzan ?  what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself ?  while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation ,  it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original .   one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane's relationship .  tarzan still speaks very broken english ,  but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate .  additionally ,  their love for each other has really blossomed ,  and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle .   most people consider  " tarzan and his mate "  superior to the original  " tarzan the ape man "  .  personally ,  i liked the first film just a little bit better .  the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt & martin arlington team isn't nearly as likable as holt's relationship with james parker  ( jane's father )  from the original .  the mr .  arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain ,  but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie .  the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him .   ( also ,  i don't want to give anything away ,  but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him ,  jane never finds out about those events ,  so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been .  )  all of these detractors are relatively minor ,  however ,  and it's still a great movie .   like the first film ,   " tarzan and his mate "  has amazing action scenes ,  wonderful wildlife footage ,  and one of the screen's all-time greatest romances .  if you liked the first film in the series ,  this is definitely a sequel to see .
1	when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan .  i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller  " was "  tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape .  it wasn't after many years that i came across  " tarzan and his mate "  ,  and then i understood .  weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker ,  gordon scott ,  jock mahoney ,  denny miller ,  miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert .   as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong ,  self minded ,  active and  " no-inhibitions "  woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made  ( tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused ;  one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it )  ;  such behaviors were unthinkable with the  " janes "  to come such as brenda joyce ,  vanessa brown ,  virginia huston or dorothy hart ,  all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle .   o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself ,  except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily ;  the combination is perfect .  another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day .    " tarzan and his mate "  stands as a fine product in its genre  ( tarzan films )  and perhaps as the best ,  though i have to admit that i also enjoyed  " tarzan's greatest adventure "   ( 1959 )  made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast  ( and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect  " all gymnasium "  physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man )  .   good for jane and her mate !
1	like tarzan the ape man  ( 1932 )  ,  only more so .  there's more of everything ,  more animals ,  more varied african tribes ,  and scenes in which the thought must be ,  if this was good with three or four lions ,  forty would be better .  tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin ,  around and around ,  jaws flapping .  tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still .  tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals .  his friends are real chimps ,  people wearing larger ape costumes ,  and elephants .  in fact ,  they use indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than african oneswith costume ears attached to their heads .  the human story :  another white man ,  worse than the rest ,  shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard .  tarzan won't show them the way ,  so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed .  tarzan intercedes ,  and the bad guy shoots himbut ,  of course ,  he survives and returns to save jane .  everybody else dies ,  holt and the bad guy and every single one of their  " boys .  "  people are expendable ,  especially africans ,  and there doesn't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them .  this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes .  there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude ,  and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing .  apparently one of weismuller's friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes ,  and not maureen o'sullivan .  she ,  however ,  moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears  ( plus a bikini top )  ,  showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip .  they still don't need to talk a lot .  they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities .  no wonder they're happy .
1	i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her .  the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen .   after the original film ,  we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other .  jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically ,  but also quite sexually in love .   one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally ,  romantically and sexually .  and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality .   the skin show in this film is off the charts .  in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff ,  leg ,  and hip baring costume ,  she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan .   ( although it is not o'sullivan ,  but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene )  weissmuller ,  also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth .  the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips .   it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry .  although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come ,  they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .
1	as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies .  unlike others however ,  i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like .  plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle .  in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made . this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals .  the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism ,  genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle .  the film also offers ,  though perhaps antecedently ,  an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers .  in addition sexy jane ,  thousands of elephants  ,  some great sets and two chetas !  not to be missed an adventure classic .
1	considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films ,  i have no argument with that ,  although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining .  one thing :  it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes .  i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long .   nonetheless ,  it is a good mixture of action ,  suspense and romance .  the only things missing are color and stereo sound .  the primitive special-effects don't bother me ,  as that was all that they had back in the 1930s .   among some ,  this film is most noted for one thing :  skin !   " jane "  never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made .  her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed .  the nude underwater scene ,  however ,  was not her - by a longshot .  the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all ,  whoever it was .   there is plenty of action in here .  up to the finale ,  it was not overdone ,  either .  the ending went on for 15 minutes ,  though ,  and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch .   still ,  this movie offers about everything - except  " boy "   ( their adopted son )  - you'd want to see in a tarzan film ,  even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times .  with her pair of  " lungs ,  "  that was no problem .
1	there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it ,  including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke .  once the viewer gets past the first three scenes ,  which are admittedly dull ,  tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot ,  offering non-stop action ,  humor ,  and romance .  maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie .  weismuller is solid as well .  highly recommended .
1	the release of tarzan the ape man ,  in 1932 ,  caused a sensation .  it may be hard to believe ,  70 years later ,  but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix ,  or the lord of the rings has achieved ,  at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment .  tarzan became an instant pop icon ,  the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about ,  and every man wished he could be .  the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs ,  who ,  while he'd agreed to mgm's creative liberties ,  and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks ,  felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character  ( with no plans to allow him to 'grow' )  was unfaithful to his vision  ( he would start a production company ,  and soon be making his own 'tarzan' films )  .  mgm ,  realizing the value of it's newest 'star' ,  knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original .  .  . and tarzan and his mate delivered !   the film had an interesting back story ;  cedric gibbons ,  mgm's legendary art director ,  had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel ,  prior to the release of tarzan the ape man ,  despite the fact that he'd never directed before  ( the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact ,  and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film .  .  . and they wanted to keep their oscar-winning department chief happy )  .  gibbons ,  a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist ,  loved the freedom of pre-code hollywood ,  and decided to have tarzan and his mate 'push the envelope' to the limit .  .  . tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim ,  and jane would appear topless through most of the film .  maureen o'sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death ,  in 1998 ,  that while a double was used for the swim ,  she trusted the studio ,  and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top .  .  . but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples ,  and the idea was abandoned  ( the film shot those days would be worth a fortune !  )  she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent ,  flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim' ,  and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative ,  very thin ,  and open at the sides .  .  . and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the hays office ,  and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry .   mgm yanked gibbons from the production  ( the 'official' reason given was his workload as art director )  ,  and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director ,  to appease the critics .  .  . although james c .  mckay actually directed the film ,  as conway was busy on 3 other projects ,  including viva villa !   the film incorporated the best elements of the original  ( safaris ,  murderous tribes ,  tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane )  ,  and actually improved on the storytelling .  harry holt  ( neil hamilton )  ,  from the first film ,  returns to africa for ivory from the 'elephants' graveyard' ,  and to try to seduce jane into returning to england ,  with gifts of silk dresses ,  underwear ,  and perfume .  he brings with him martin arlington  ( paul cavanagh )  ,  a crack shot and inveterate womanizer ,  who sneers at holt's chivalrous pursuit of jane ,  and stalks her as a potential 'conquest' ,  to be had by any means  ( including killing tarzan ,  if and when he can get away with it without being seen )  .   tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane ,  and puts his foot down ,  refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard .  arlington finds his opportunity ,  catching the ape man alone ,  and shoots him ,  then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise .  now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle ,  and she can direct them to the graveyard ,  before her long voyage back to england ,  comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic arlington .  but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group .  .  . can tarzan ,  being nursed back to health by his ape 'family' ,  recover in time to save jane ?   while stock footage is again used extensively ,  the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent ,  and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits ,  tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'tarzan' film ,  as well as a sexiness that even bo derek's blatantly erotic tarzan ,  the ape man couldn't touch .  johnny weissmuller was in peak condition ,  physically ,  maureen o'sullivan was never more beautiful ,  and 'africa' never looked more romantic ,  and dangerous .   tarzan and his mate was a triumph  ( although it would be drastically edited for many years )  ,  and remains the classic of the series ,  to this day !
1	with iphigenia ,  mikhali cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient greek theatre to the screen .  his own screenplay ,  an adaptation of euripides' tragedy ,  was far from easy ,  compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed .  the story has been very carefully deconstructed from euripides' version and placed in a logical ,  strictly chronological framework ,  better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling .  cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in euripides' tragedy :  odysseus ,  calchas ,  and the army .  this was done in order to make some of euripides' points regarding war ,  the church ,  and government clearer .  finally ,  cacoyannis' iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to euripides' .   the film was shot on location at aulis .  the director of photography ,  giorgos arvanitis ,  shows us a rugged but beautiful greece ,  where since the homeric days time seems to have stood still .  he takes advantage of the bodies ,  the arid land ,  the ruins ,  the intense light and the darkness .  the harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters .  the camera uses the whole gamut of available shots ,  from the very long ,  reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape ,  as well as the human scale involved ,  to the extreme close-ups ,  dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters .  in particular ,  the film's opening ,  with a bold ,  accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats ,  followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach ,  is a very effective means of communicating agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility .   no word but  " sublime "  can describe the stunning performances of costa kazakos  ( agamemnon )  ,  irene papas  ( clytemnestra )  ,  and tatiana papamoschou  ( iphigenia )  .  kazakos and papas embody the sublimity of the classical greece tragedy .  kazakos' character is extremely down-to-earth ,  and his powerful look into the camera ,  more than his words ,  reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul .  irene papas is the modern quintessence of classic greek plays .  in iphigenia ,  she is terrible in her anguish ,  and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance .  tatiana papamoskou ,  in her first role on the screen ,  is outstanding in her portray of the innocent iphigenia ,  which contrasts with kazakos' austere depiction of her father ,  agamemnon .   cacoyannis is faithful to euripides in his representation of the other characters :  odysseus is a sly ,  scheming politician ,  achilles ,  a vain ,  narcissistic warrior ,  menalaus is self centered ,  obsessed with his honor ,  eager to be avenged ,  and to have his wife and property restored .   the costumes and sets are realistic :  no hollywood there .  agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn ,  he dresses ,  as do the others ,  in utilitarian ,  hand-woven ,  simple garb .  clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts .   the music is by the prolific contemporary music composer mikis theodorakis .  theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding ,  reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy ,  and accentuates its dimensions and actuality .   this film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization .  it teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures .  euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love ,  and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence .  in his adaptation of euripides' tragedy ,  cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern ,  clear ,  and dramatic fashion .   the relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated :  war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer .  with the possible exception of menelaus ,  whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover ,  everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with troy ,  which has nothing to do with helen :  the thirst for power  ( agamemnon )  ,  greed  ( the army ,  odysseus )  ,  or glory  ( achilles )  .  and so in a real sense ,  helen became the wmd of the trojan war .  the war ,  stripped of all homeric glamor and religious sanctioning ,  was just an imperialist venture ,  spurred primarily by the desire for material gain ,  all else being a convenient pretext .   another conflict raised in the film is that between the church and the state .  calchas ,  who represents the church ,  feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy agamemnon for the insult to the goddess he serves ,  tells him to sacrifice his daughter .  in consenting to the sacrifice ,  the king comes closer to his moral undoing ,  but in refusing ,  loses his power over the masses  ( his army )  ,  who are brainwashed by religion .  of course ,  for agamemnon ,  it's a game .  the king must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the gods or not ,  until he realizes ,  too late ,  that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide .   is it a sacrifice or a murder ,  and how can we tell the difference between the two ?  by focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and ,  worst of all ,  the sacrifice of one's own child--euripides/cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal .  it touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society :  the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society .  in the case of iphigenia ,  however ,  as in the biblical tale of abraham and isaac ,  the father is asked to kill his own child ,  by his own hand .  what sort of god would insist on such payment ?  can it be just or moral ,  even if divinely inspired ?  finally ,  does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war ?  these are many deep questions raised by a two-hour film .
1	has anyone been able to buy this movie ?  my uncle  " hutch "  was a real  ( not reel )  pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings .    he's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie .  he was killed in a dogfight over italy ,  he was only 24 at the time .  do we know the film studio that made it ?   or has anyone seen it at a video store ,  like blockbuster ?  i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd's these days .   please email me at nfny40@yahoo . com if you know where i can buy a copy .  thank you .
1	i saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with it .   it took 30+ years ,  but i recently did find it on dvd - it wasn't cheap ,  either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies .  we watched it last night for the first time .  the audio was good ,  however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels .  even so ,  it was better than i remembered it .  i was also impressed at how true it was to the play .   the catalog is around here someplace .  if you're sincere in finding it ,  fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info .  cartwrightbride@yahoo . com
1	william wyler was to have directed this adaptation of moss hart's hit broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant ,  but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman :  george cukor .  the  " women's director "  has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of air corps training ,  and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed ,  particularly in wartime .  sure ,  the gee-whiz  ( and entirely white ,  save for one unbilled chinese-american recruit )  bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life ,  and the speechifying about home and mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick ,  but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring .  notable ,  too ,  for the all-military male cast ,  several of whom didn't reemerge for years :  lon mcallister ,  edmond o'brien ,  martin ritt ,  red buttons  ( in drag ,  as an andrews sister )  ,  peter lind hayes ,  karl malden ,  kevin mccarthy ,  gary merrill ,  lee j .  cobb ,  and don taylor .  also for a very early glimpse of judy holliday ,  who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as o'brien's worried-sick brooklyn spouse .  too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm ;  evidently ,  after twentieth century fox released it  ( to considerable success )  ,  the rights reverted to the army ,  and if there's a good 35mm print out there ,  it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the pentagon .  it's disingenuous and corny in spots ,  but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly ,  and it deserves to be more widely seen .
1	this movie gets it right .  as a former usaf aviation cadet ,  i can tell you this movie has it all .  the tedium of the application process .  the waiting for word .  the joy of acceptance .  the worry about making it through the course .  the sorrow of watching one's buddies  ( perhaps the best of them ) wash out .  the anguish of paying the ultimate price - the death of fllow student airmen .  the glory of graduation .  always the flying ,  the flying ,  the flying .  many are called but few are chosen .  we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do .
1	this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television station's  " late show "  .  the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture ,  and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape ,  nor is it ever shown on television  ( apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart ,  the playwright/producer/director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii -- the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made )  .  i did not see the movie again for over 30 years ,  when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a  " bootlegged "  copy on vhs  ( poor video quality ,  but good audio )  .  my memory of it was correct :  it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch .  an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars ,  just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 )  ,  went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors  ( e . g .  judy holliday ,  edmond o'brien ,  jeanne crain ,  barry nelson ,  don taylor ,  karl malden ,  peter lind hayes ,  george  " superman "  )  reeves ,  red buttons ,  lee j .  cobb ,  kevin mccarthy ,  and gary merrill )  .  the scenes with the b-24 liberators are terrific ,  especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant  ( for those times )  4-engine bomber  ( then 18 , 000+ manufactured ,  now nearly extinct )  can be seen .  good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew  ( of course ,  very gender-biased as was the trend of the day :  only the men became pilots ,  the women just supported them in their roles -- hardly acceptable in today's world )  .  i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .
1	i had a personal interest in this movie .  when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union .  at the end of my first day  ( sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier )  i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc .  for one or two weeks .  when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego .  just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn .  once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton ,  the big marine base .  there ,  on the beach ,  we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base .  it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation ,  which included a water tank ,  gun entrenchments ,  sand-bagged trenches and living quarters .  all this was at very high pay ,  sometimes 'golden time' ,  which was triple our regular hourly wage .  our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch ,  etc .  - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home .   once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out ,  which was about eight or ten months later .  then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen .  then it was no more than three or four minutes  ( maybe less )  of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens .  a bit disappointing ,  but still fun .    in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since .  i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis ,  which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there .  bob weverka
1	this movie is a ripoff of james cain's novel ,  the postman always rings twice .  apparently ,  the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties !  despite this ,  the movie isn't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie .  in some ways it's a lot better and in other ways ,  it is definitely not .   the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people .  in fact ,  the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking .  the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair  ( particularly on the back and shoulders )  and his lady love is ,  to put it frankly ,  unattractive .  they are a very ,  very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version .  and the ill-fated husband is really ,  really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the american film ,  cecil kellaway is definitely better looking  ( and probably better looking than the other two italian leads ,  actually )  .  and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film--since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed  " dish "  like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway--i am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers !  whereas ,  the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable .   part of the italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex .  the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway ,  they never actually get around to sex !  this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic .  in addition to the casual sexuality of the film ,  it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people ,  a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath .   the movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long american film .  and what you get due to brevity isn't all good .  the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film--with grainier footage ,  relatively poor orchestration and sets .  it sure ain't a pretty film ,  but the neo-realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic .  but it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot .  many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over .  and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats  ( the best part of the american film )  .   so which is the better film ?  well ,  a lot of this probably depends on you .  as for me ,  the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic  ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) --but it packed a great ending .  and the italian film was much ,  much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed .  so neither film is exactly great ,  but i'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better .  it's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .
1	the ruth snyder - judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal .  more famously ,  it inspired james m .  cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - double indemnity and the postman always rings twice .  both became film noir classics of the 1940's ,  double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made .  some of the real-life elements of the snyder-gray story were captured by cain - the old age and indifference of albert gray ,  ruth's high sex drive ,  ruth and judd's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause .  missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan - albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor .  the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase .   cain's double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder - let's ignore stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore !  the postman always rings twice ,  however ,  was filmed thrice and ossessione ,  an italian version and luchino visconti's first film ,  was the first of three versions .  before commenting on it ,  i'll recommend the lana turner - john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson - jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table .   ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice .  it has a strong neo-realist look which makes it a great movie ,  but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing .  it does not have low-key lighting and unconventional camera angles .  the dialog is not hard-boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization .  this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization .  its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version .  we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac .  a new character is introduced into the story - la spagnola - with very obvious homosexual overtones .  there is also a small ,  but very well-played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute .   this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime .  the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime .  the drifter is a complete tramp ,  the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage .  her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese ,  rude and arrogant .  i think the casting was brilliant for this film .  my only beef is with the overlong running time .  everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical .  nevertheless ,  fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione ,  as i did .
1	well ,  i'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre ,  and particular favourite of mine ,  the 'giallo' .  .  . but actually ,  aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy ;  the two have pretty much no relation .  in the sixties and seventies ,  italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released .  they've not done that here ,  but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film 'the postman always rings twice' ,  without giving the book's author ,  james m .  cain ,  so much as a credit !  anyway ,  the plot focuses on gino costa ,  a handsome drifter who ,  by chance ,  stumbles upon a café where a woman named giovanna bragana works .  he soon learns that she's married to giuseppe ;  a big fat annoying man ,  whom giovanna can't stand to have even touching her .  he wants the pair of them to run away together ,  but she's not so keen on the idea .  however ,  fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful .  .  .   despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on ,  it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well ,  and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics .  the story is ,  as you would expect ,  extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast .  visconti drags the film out a little bit too much ,  however ,  and with a running time of almost 135 minutes ,  i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length .  i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film ,  but it's not a 'great' film .  the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly ,  and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads .  there's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on ,  and by not always focusing on the characters themselves ;  the film is not as interesting as it could have been .  still ,  it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason .  .  . although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m .  cain classic .
1	ossessione  luchino visconti's debut film ,  this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement--well ,  it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating ,  sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux .  set in fascist italy ,  an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without ,  drifting phantasms longing for a soul .  although visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed ,  the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale ,  gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic ,  the illicit relationship strained with bathos .  all the same ,  it's incisive and essential ,  although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable .
1	'iphigenia' is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis .  this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast .  cacoyannis achieved the impossible .  he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance .  a stellar greek cast helps him in this .  newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia .  equally impressive is irene papas  , who even though she sometimes seems over the top ,  it is very realistic .  a wonderful greek film ,  beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis ,  with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every scene .   p . s .  rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote !  !  !
1	audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out .  the structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements .  it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light .  films of this naturethe neo-realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-world war ii times .  ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war ,  including :  adultery ,  conspiracy ,  murder ,  pregnancy ,  etc .  aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments ,  the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty :  shot on-location ,  uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors .  all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film ,  yielding the following theme :  negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally .   the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites ,  yet both carry the mentality :  we're bored and we want to be entertained .  gino is a drifter ;  a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations .  giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence :  she doesn't want to leave her home and husband ,  but would rather remain where she is because it's safer .  gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves ;  the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfthat's why she falls in love with gino :  he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get .  she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world .  the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy .  i mean ,  films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before .  to say the least it was probably a bit alarming .   in conjunction with the theme ,  the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior .  succinctly put ,  adulterous behavior  ( as shown in the film )  leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives .  when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to  " eliminate "  giovanna's husband ,  karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done .  they return to their home :  the atmosphere is dark and biting  ( as can be expected from the neo-realist style )  .  they are not happy ;  they're actually more depressed .  they thought that by eliminating giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives ,  but they were duped .  the film ends with giovanna's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death .  i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons .  here's why .   there's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen ,  and if so ,  to what extent .  i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified ,  but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have .  as the subtext of ossessione asks ,  is adultery and murder evil ?  i think the film eagerly responds yes !  the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are .  ironically though ,  towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car ,  the author of the film shows that their happiness is ,  in fact ,  a façade :  the car crashes off the cliff and into the river ,  killing giovanna ;  the police arrest gino .  i think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior ,  in the end karma will come back to haunt them .  i agree .  i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times .  this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship :  he can't handle the pressure of living in giovanna's husband shadow ,  so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl .  such is typical of the insatiable ,  hedonistic personality .   all in all ,  the film seemed very risky for its time .  the audience ,  however ,  was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought .  those pre-war ,  happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed .  movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters :  they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems .  ossessione ,  then ,  acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading .  that is ,  a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement .
1	oh ,  those sneaky italians .  it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the ,  in this case ,  author of the novel .  of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema ,  mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it .  james m .  cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic .   the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless .  this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story ,  that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism .  it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story ,  with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment .   leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it .  these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch .  unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end ,  when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts .  the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier .   nevertheless ,  i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie .  it's simply a greatly made one ,  based on some equally great and strong source material .  quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti ,  who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies .   8/10
1	visconti's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique ,  accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and ,  best of all ,  clara calamai as the fabulous ,  frantic giovanna .  remade several times as 'the postman rings twice' but never bettered .  can't believe this was the man's first film !  it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .
1	i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain's novel  " the postman always rings twice "   ( i'm not even sure if viscounti acquired the book's rights )  ,  but the resulting movie is definitely interesting .  it is not the best version of cain's story  ( i like the 1981 version best )  ,  but thanks to visconti's excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti  ( a very sensual couple )  ,  it is a must for noir fans .  visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect .  the film is not perfect ,  though .  my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good ;  the story moves at a very slow pace  ( i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films )  .  i think film noir works better with a short running time .  fortunately ,  calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested .  anyhow ,  as much as i like this film and the remakes ,  i think no one has made the definitive version of cain's much-praised book .
1	when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama ,  they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic ,  melancholic roles .  this opinion ,  however ,  does not resemble neorealist movies ,  in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti .  ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others .  the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself ,  exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past .  at the same time ,  while being based on the novel by james m .  cain ,  the postman always rings twice ,  it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style ,  view ,  his own art .  i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to entail below .   first ,  visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life ,  in particular those absorbed by desire .  these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face .  gino  ( massimo girotti )  a traveler with  " bear like shoulders "  turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern .  although many people go there to have a meal ,  gino occurs to get something more - much more :  the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna  ( clara calamai )  a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar ,  mr giuseppe bragana  ( juan de landa )  .  her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love ,  the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together .  .  .  however ,  are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire ?  can one build love upon murder ?  what is love and what is loyalty ?  does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession ?  such questions intensely arise while watching the movie ,  when ,  to the core ,  the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters .   " we have to love each other affectionately "  answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything ?   " isn't it what we both wanted "  says one of the couple .  .  .  it occurs that it's not .  therefore ,  the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart .  yet ,  it constantly remains thought provoking .   second ,  ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers :  brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography ,  which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power .  these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch .  they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots .  who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl ,  a sort of  " ragazza perfetta "   ( perfect girl )  ,  a dancer anita and buys her ice cream .  his desires show him totally different direction .  .  .  do viewers remain indifferent at gino-giovanna's first meeting ?  the first focus of camera is on giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences .  a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look .   third ,  ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast .  massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done ;  yet ,  consequently ,  what comes out is a flawless acting .  he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim ,  which represents conscience .  his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo  ( elio marcuzzo )  whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona .  clara calamai ,  who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused ,  fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple .  they are both very convincing .  besides ,  i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana :  he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art .  in some of his most witty moments ,  he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance .   in sum ,  we ,  as modern viewers who are capable of critical view ,  have to look at this film very objectively .  it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned ,  it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries ;  yet ,  is it educational ?  visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity .  in such case ,  his films would only entertain  ( which is ,  of course ,  not entirely fellini's style ,  too )  .  visconti always had something to convey .  what did he want to say here ?  is the film against bad marriage ?  or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire ?  the final shocking moments say for themselves .  though you don't have to agree with the vision ,  ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film ,  one of visconti's best 8/10
1	a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe :  an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter ,  but still has an ace up her sleeve :  beauty and youth .  bragana ,  a fat-bellied gas station tenant ,  who has been getting on in years ,  picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection .  but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust ,  and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of .   the arrival of gino ,  a young migrant worker ,  finally provides her the longed-for opportunity .  and you don't have to ask her twice :  at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired ,  and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance .   the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though .  gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed ,  his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside .  giovanna aims at another goal :  to get bragana killed ,  to inherit and ,  in addition to that ,  to collect the insurance premium .  in her hands gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool .  being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer .   but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level .  the very taking over of bragana's place ,  which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man ,  causes a deep loathing of himself .  and later ,  after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna's cunningly devised plan ,  he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute .   if visconti's film ended at this point ,  it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool ,  calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism .  but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse .  at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done ,  and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino's love .  her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate .  it also affects us ,  while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster .  the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start .
1	to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track ,  not only the music ,  but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery .  how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity !  note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside giovanna's marriage .  don't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in 1943 .  that's not what this is about .  on the other hand ,  if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds ,  you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism .  by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places .  this is one of my favorite visconti films .
1	tcm is keeping me awake all the time .  .  .  they keep coming up with films ive never heard of  .  .  .  senso .  .  .  .  now ossessione .  .  .  a very early film by visconti !  !  .  .  .  wow .  .  .  the italian version of the postman always rings twice .  .  . brilliant !  !  beautifully acted and directed  .  .  . never heard of either leads who were excellent ,  clara calamai , as giovanna ,  and especially ,  massimo girotti as gino .  .  .  what a sensual man  !  !  more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !  !  !  his look was ahead of its time .  .  . many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him .  .  .  he should have been a major world wide star !  !  the film is much better than the jack nicholson/jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version  ( which i really like )  with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit  ?  who can forget .  .  .  .  this italian version is different  .  . more realistic and with a very different ending .  .  .  see it watch it .  .  . im going to buy it  !  !
1	a masterful treatment of james caine's  " the postman always rings twice "  as luchino visconti's first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy .  the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today .  a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai  ( who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe "   ( 1941 )  ,  star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband .  unusual ending in which ,  although crime does not pay ,  one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime .  excellent direction ,  script ,  acting ,  and cinematography .  reportedly not as good as the french  " le dernier tournant'  ( 1939 )  but probably better than the us version  ( 1946 )  featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles .  highly recommended .
1	ossessione ,  adapted loosely  ( or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m .  cain's the postman always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i can't be certain )  by first time director luchino visconti ,  is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene ,  music  ( both diegetic and non-diegetic )  ,  and the acting .  i didn't know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material ,  after seeing la terra trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit .  but this is a totally character and emotional based drama ,  bordering on melodrama  ( however ,  without the conventions that bog down lesser ones )  ,  and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement ,  visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo-realist film .  neo-realism ,  by the way ,  could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather  ( along with de sica's the children are watching us )  ,  which that would take shape after the war .  although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts ,  it's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion ,  and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism  ( the lower-class ,  death ,  desperation )  .   aside from the story ,  which is simply as it is described on this site ,  the artistry with which visconti captures the images ,  and then layers them with objects  ( a shawl over gino costa's profile when in guilt )  ,  shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film  ( usually over gian and giovanna )  ,  and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes .  domenico scala and aldo tonti  ( who would lens some of rossellini and fellini's films )  help in envisioning the look of ossessione ,  which is usually moving in on a character ,  then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces ,  their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly ,  sad and dark and romantic .  i think i've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along ,  even as i was in fear of the futures of the two leads .  the two leads  ( massimo girotti and clara calamai )  portray all the compelling ,  truthful ,  and near-operatic emotions ,  and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes .    it's a brilliant ,  crushing adaptation ,  and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for visconti in his career .
1	i haven't seen this movie in about 5 years ,  but it still haunts me .    when asked about my favorite films ,  this is the one that i seem to always mention first .  there are certain films  ( works of art like this film ,   " dark city "  ,  and  " breaking the waves "  )  that seem to touch a place within you ,  a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive ,  that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer ,  not unlike a life-changing event ,  such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend .  .  .  this film  " shook "  me when i first saw it .  it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days .
1	fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini .  street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching .  combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again  .   .  .  and maybe again .
1	ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen .  the material used is a  " master positive "  2nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists .  it has been scanned on the spirit 4k  ( as 2k rgb data )  then processed using davinci revival restoration software .  after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring .  sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd .  this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come .
1	gino costa  ( massimo girotti )  is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar .  he meets the young ,  beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana  ( clara calamai )  and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana  ( juan de landa )  ,  owners of the bar .  he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging ,  and has an affair with giovanna .  they both decide to kill giuseppe ,  forging a car accident .  the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police .  this masterpiece ends in a tragic way .  the noir and neo-realistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding .  this is the first time that i watch this version of `the postman always rings twice' .  i loved the 1946 version with lana turner ,  and the 1981 version ,  where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema ,  but this one is certainly the best .  my vote is ten .
1	wow !  the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances .  absolutely incredible !  if this was visconti's debut film ,  i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film .  the only other one of his i've seen  ( at time of writing )  is death in venice - which was absolutely incredible :  more dazzling visually than ossessione  ( obsession )  .  one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen ,  but its story was not as involving as ossessione .  if you click on  " miscellaneous "  on this page's links ,  there are stills from the movie on those websites .  they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie :  such graceful camera movements ,  such beautiful composition ,  such wonderful faces ,  such terrific characters ,  such a great story development ,  the first movie adapted from james m cain's  " the postman always rings twice .  "   i can't believe this was made in 43 ,  eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire  ( 1951 )  .  the actors in this may not have used the method technique ,  ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves  ( i don't know anything about it )  - but they're some of the best ,  most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema .  also ,  eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen ,  ossessione was electrifyingly sensual !  the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema !  yes ,  i'm being superlative ,  but ossessione was just that terrific .   the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini ,  and re-cut in america .  american audiences didn't see its full glory till 59 ,  eight years after streetcar .   i won't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best ,  most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen ,  and tell you to go out and see it !  like another reviewer ,  i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it !
1	luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries .  the great directors of italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium ,  but it was luchino visconti ,  a man of vision ,  who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing .  he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with  " ossessione "  ,  a film based on james cain's  " the postman always ring twice "  ,  which was later made by hollywood ,  but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie .  luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia ,  a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings .   the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently .  the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way ,  something the american version lacked .   what comes across watching the movie ,  is the intensity which the director got from his key players .  the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna ,  the woman who has married an older man ,  but when gino appears in her life ,  all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life .  giovanna is one of the best creations in ms .  calamai's achievements in the italian cinema .  the last sequence of the film shows ms .  calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed .   equally excellent is massimo girotti ,  one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino ,  the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna .  gino is the perfect man for giovanna ,  something that mr .  girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen .  mr .  girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy ,  yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent .  juan delanda is seen as giuseppe ,  the older man who fell in love with giovanna .  in fact ,  his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film ,  where he is seen more as a buffoon .   the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti .  they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored .  the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect .  visconti ,  a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors ,  also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie .    " ossessione "  is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form .
1	( some spoilers )  i have not read the james m .  cain novel  ( `the postman always rings twice' )  on which this movie was based ,  so i cannot compare this film version to it ,  but i have seen and love the 1946 us version  ( also entitled `postman' )  .   even better is this gem from italy ,  which ,  i have read ,  was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime .  well ,  no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema ,  apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making .  one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on ,  a pervading sense of societal and cultural ,  as well as personal oppression remains ,  hanging heavy over the protagonists ,  who therefore face many limits in life .   consider gino ,  the young drifter ,  not well educated ,  unemployed ,  and resorting to stowing away ,  stealing and conning people in order to get by ,  his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless .   in giovanna ,  he sees a way out ,  yet he should have kept going ,  as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money ,  her job  ( working at the trattoria for her husband ,  slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen )  ,  and her sex .  in the past ,  she had limited options ,  and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner  ( giuseppe bregana ,  played by juan de landa )  anyway ,  knowing that he would not make her happy .  she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her .   on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part  ( which he has in fact pocketed )  ,  gino wins bregana's favor  ( promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life ,  or lack thereof )  and is left alone with giovanna .  they immediately start a heated ,  passionate ,  yet volatile love affair .   gino soon feels stifled by the relationship ,  and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband .  wanting no part of it ,  gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford ,  kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named spagnolo ,  a fellow train passenger .  to gino ,  spagnolo represents a sort of freedom ,  and they become friends  ( spagnolo also symbolizes gino's morality and conscience )  ,  traveling and finding work at a carnival together .  finally gino has steady employment .  to his dismay  ( he is not yet over his love for giovanna )  ,  a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again ,  as he is handy to have around .   too weak-willed to resist ,  knowing this will reunite he and giovanna ,  gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple .  after a while he gives in to gina's demands to get rid of her husband .  once the evil deed is done ,  giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever ,  seeming to have very little conscience ,  while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm .  as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly ,  they are now inextricably linked ,  and must face the consequences .   i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good ,  and interesting ,  adding another dimension to the story .   while the '46 u . s .  version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters ,  especially the cops and the lawyers ,  ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone .  this gives the final outcome even more potency ,  and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live .   a minor quibble :  the amount of time  ( hardly any )  that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers ,  how quickly they kill the husband  ( there is no botched first attempt as in the u . s .  version )  ;  gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well ,  and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met !   all rather unrealistic ,  isn't it ?  i found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere .  otherwise ,  well worth the viewer's time .  the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout .  recommended .
1	visconti's first feature ,  ossessione is an adaptation of james m .  cain's the postman always rings twice .  now ,  i'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions ,  but i am a big fan of cain's double indemnity  ( much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder's film version of it ,  in fact )  .  the two novellas seem like they must be very similar .  both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her .  giovanna ,  the woman in this italian version ,  played very well by clara calamai ,  is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity ,  but she seems very spoiled .  her husband  ( a great performance by juan de landa )  is a bit cruel to her ,  but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him .  he's older than her and unattractive ,  so she's rather fickle .  when gino shows up ,  a young ,  muscular man ,  it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed .  she sweats she wants to be with him forever ,  but she's stuck with her husband .  they break up at first ,  but when they meet again ,  they  ( apparently ,  although this is intentionally vague )  plan to murder the husband .  they are successful ,  and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned .  gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea .  he wants giovanna ,  but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life .  their relationship quickly crumbles .  ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters .  it's always fascinating ,  but it does go on a bit too long .  at two hours and twenty-two minutes ,  i can't ,  for the life of me ,  figure out how it took that long !  this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film .  it was ,  after all ,  the first film that won that label .  we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life ,  without any hurrying to the next plot point .  i've seen many of visconti's films ,  and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers  ( 1960 )  .  his direction is as great as it ever was ,  with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect .  i also feel the need to point out the film's best performance ,  by dhia christiani as a young  ( exotic )  dancer and part-time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna .  she's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes ,  and she has only a few lines .  it's shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time .  she's absolutely heartbreaking .  9/10 .
1	this is a really fun movie .  one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted ;  more and more funny .  sally field ,  teri hatcher  ( in her hey-day )  ,  kevin klein ,  elisabeth shue ,  robert downey ,  jr .  .  . it's all these well-known ,  quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars/producers .  if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought ,   " how on earth did they come up with this idea ?  ?  "  ,  you will love this movie .  i have seen it multiple times ;  and each time i watch it ,  the more i appreciate the humor ,  the more i realize just how well-acted it really is .  don't expect oscar quality .  this is a fun movie to entertain ,  not some artsy attempt at finding  " man's inner man "  ,  etc .  sit back ,  relax ,  and laugh .
1	this is a haunting ,  powerful italian adaptation of james m .  cain's novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti .  what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material to become something bolder and more original  ( interestingly camus also credits cain's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger )  .  the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender .  cain's very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness  ( the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant )  ,  which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in .  this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate ,  doomed love affair of the two main characters .  this film is a complex ,  suspenseful ,  rewarding experience .
1	watching  " ossessione "  today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience ,  especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever  ( roughly from  " ossessione "  and de sica's  " i bambini ci guardano "  ,  both 1943 ,  up to 20 years later with fellini ,  antonioni ,  pasolini )  .  visconti makes an amazing directing début ,  taking the  ( uncredited )  plot of  " the postman always rings twice "  as a guide to the development of his own themes .   it strikes us even today how ahead of its time  " ossessione "  was .  shot in fascist italy during world war ii  ( think about it !  !  )  ,  it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn't help .     " ossessione "  alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time italy  ( far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist  " telefoni bianchi "  movies )  ;  but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness ,  with shirtless hunk gino  ( massimo girotti ,  who definitely precedes brando's kowalski in  " a streetcar named desire "  )  taking giovanna  ( clara calamai )  ,  a married woman ,  to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet .  we watch calamai's unglamorous ,  matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo  ( elio marcuzzo - a very appealing actor ,  his face not unlike pierre clémenti's ,  who was shot by the nazis in 1945 ,  at 28 years old !  )  .  .  . in a few words :  sex ,  lust ,  greed and poverty ,  as relentlessly as it had rarely ,  if ever ,  been shown before in italian cinema .   all the copies of  " ossessione "  were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral .  visconti managed to save a print ,  and when the film was re-released after the war ,  most critics called it the front-runner of the neo-realist movement ,  preceding rossellini's  " roma città aperta "  and de sica's  " sciuscià "  .  some other critics ,  perhaps more appropriately ,  saw  " ossessione "  as the italian counterpart to the  " poetic realism "  of french cinema  ( remember visconti had been renoir's assistant )  ,  especially marcel carné's  " quai des brumes "  and  " le jour se lève "  ,  and julien duvivier's  " pépé le moko "  .    while  " ossessione "  may be neo-realistic in its visual language  ( the depiction of war-time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs ,  poverty ,  child labor ,  prostitution ,  bums ,  swindlers etc )  ,  the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian .  he was always more interested in tragic ,  passionate ,  obsessive ,  greedy characters ,  in social/political/sexual apartheid ,  in the decadence of the elites than in realistic ,   " everyday- life "  characters and themes ,  favored by desica and rossellini .  in  " ossessione "  we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films ,  especially  " senso "   ( visconti's definitive departure from neo-realist aesthetics )  and  " rocco e suoi fratelli "  .  .  . even in his most  " neo-realist "  film ,   " la terra trema "  ,  he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures .    " ossessione "  is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches ,  analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again ,  from their first to their last opus ,  no matter if the scenery ,  background or time-setting may change -- visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are ,  well ,  obsessively recurrent .   " ossessione "  is not to be missed :  you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking ,  powerful film .
1	well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it's greatness .  fantastic script ,  great acting ,  costumes and special effects ,  and the plot twists ,  wow !  !  in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself .   great ,  i would recommend this film to anyone ,  especially if i don ; t like them much .   terrific
1	its hollywood imitating daytiem soap operas at its finest !  its the fun that we never see .  great characters and great lines .  whoopi is hilarious .  .  .  .  . sally field is so over the top .  .  .  . gary marshalls lines are a riot .  .  .  . this is what i love about good comedies .  never afraid to poke fun at themselves !  !  !  !  !  ! the sets were great .  .  .  . wardrobe was on point and the backstabbing  " montana morehead "  was a devilish delight .  terri hatcher as  " dr .  monica demonico "  didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen .  i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up .  never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work !  soapdish is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd !  !  !
1	when i started watching the show i said  " oh ,  no !  it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody !  "  .  and indeed ,  the setup is almost identical ,  with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself ,  then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him .   but this is where the resemblance stops .  the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha ,  while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few .  the magical setup is a bit corny ,  because it's about seven people ,  with seven servants ,  fighting for the holy grail ,  all servants being someone famous ,  half of all masters being from the same school ,  rules of engagement ,  etc .  however ,  this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script .   i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and ,  without comparing it with animes that i liked more ,  but were from other genres ,  i have to say that i was very pleased .
1	this anime seriously rocked my socks .  when the anime first opened itself ,  i felt it was too slow ;  the story wasn't quite moving forward ,  and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead .  once he learns more about tracing ,  and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself ,  the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together .  it was fantastic .   additionally ,  i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop ,  in the real world .  there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on ;  the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch ,  but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on .  a few of the  " surprise "  people that show up  ( gilgamesh ?  )  seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another ,  meaning we didn't have  " generic bad-ass a "  being replaced by  " generic bad-ass b "  as soon as a died .   anddd ,  i loved the music .  the opening music rocked ,  and the finishing theme from the final episode just .  .  . seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more .  good job ,  type-moon !
1	fate/stay night is an animated series inspired by a h-game .  somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff .  it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection .  ( you'll understand once you see all the episodes )  .   despite a relatively slow start  ( the producer took his time on presenting the characters )  things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat .   the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years .  the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on .  shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city . he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju  ( holy mark )  to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield ,  saber .  his first contact with saber left him stunned  " such immeasurable beauty  .  .  . i was at a lost for words "  .    you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot .  fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights ,  good animation ,  spectacular lights ,  great soundtrack ,  it offers excellent character and relationship development .  it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate .  the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals  ( not similar to the linear type other series use )  that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal ,  from under the mask of perfection ,  flawed characters .   the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such .  you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact ,  just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can .  the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath .
1	i have to agree with everyone else that has posted .   i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you ,  whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story ,  the beautiful animation ,  the characters and the feeling i got when watching it ,  and it does make me cry ( such a happy yet sad feeling )  .  i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience .   i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research ( and watch the ending a few more times )  and i found all my answers and a whole lot more .  i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime ,  it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more .  ( i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime )   i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely .  i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story ,  well built characters ( some mysterious ) and a bit of fantasy action .   also ,  even though this was based on a h-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way .  ( i have no problem with mature anime ,  in most cases i prefer it )
1	when i first heard about this series on animetv , i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen , this one tops it all off .  i had to see this show , and that is what i really did .  when i got the first volume of this show , it was the best .  i really liked the animation , and all the fight scenes were awesome .  i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber , and archer and of course i also like illya .  and of course , all the episodes on the volumes were interesting , and very cool .  another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie ( famous for transformers , and others )  playing the voice of berserker .  he does have a cool character .  and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume .  so if you to see something good , then see this show , it's the best .
1	i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing !  i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion .  this series is actually based off an h-game ,  which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not ,  i haven't played the game ,  but from what i've heard it follows it very well .   i give this series a 10/10 .  it has a great story ,  interesting characters ,  and some of the best animation i've seen .  it also has some great japanese music in it too !   if you haven't seen this series yet ,  check it out .  you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there ,  it's straight out of japan .
1	this movie probably had a $750 budget ,  and still managed to surpass titanic .  i rented this the day i crashed my mom's car ,  and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief !  it has to be tied with 'the assult of the killer bimbos' .  things to look for are :  1 .  the drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 .  the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 .  the flinstone-like screech out driving 4 .  the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed  ( don't worry ,  i'm not ruining any surprises ,  for it's soooo predictable )  5 .  the guy who finds it necessary to howl .  6 .  the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen .  7 .  the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest .  8 .  the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall .  9 .  last ,  but not least ,  the wonderful special effects--especially the stab in the boob that made a .  .  .  heaven help me .  .  .  popping noise .   enjoy !
1	this movie is great .  if you enjoy watching b-class movies ,  that is .  this is a classic college 80's slasher movie ,  in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack .  a horrible film ,  but worth renting to make fun of ,  or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives .  kinda funny ,  if you ask me .
1	the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist' plot made this a real knock out for me .  the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping .  there was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by lensky's heart-wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin .   for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium ,  which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film .  krisana is in the same mould .
1	this is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession .   matiss ,  on a lonely night stroll in riga  (  ?  )  passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing .  he passes by without a word .  only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act .  and then only too little and too late .   the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman .  on a troll of local bars ,  he finds her pocketbook .  he pieces more and more of her life together .  his  " look "  changes as his obsession grows .  he has to make things right .  in a marvelously filmed dialog with the  " bastard ex-boyfriend "  he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel .   haunting long takes ,  a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt ,  barking dogs .  footsteps .  lovely film noir with a lovely twist .  a good indie ending .
1	this is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife ,  daughter ,  and i found it irresistible .  the plot is just crazy but  " rings true "  to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities .    i particularly enjoyed kevin kline's and sally field's performances .  i don't anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded .  field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of field's famous  ( infamous ?  )   " you like me !  "  oscar exclamation .  people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world .    i think this is the only movie where i didn't find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization ;  i thought she was  " spot on "  in every note she struck .  robert downey jr .  ,  teri hatcher ,  cathy moriarty ,  and elizabeth shue were also first-rate as well .  just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh !
1	i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film ,  but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair ,  so i feel it necessary to share my point of view .    " krisana "   ( or as it was titled at the theater i saw it ,   " fallen "  )  follows matiss ,  a lonely latvian archivist ,  as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge ,  as well as her reasons for doing so .  that's the plot in a nutshell ,  but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act .  as a detective who investigates the incident tells him ,  we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die .   comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his  " blowup "  will most likely abound in any review you read about  " krisana .  "  the influence of antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of  " blowup "  are clear and ,  in fact ,  writer/director fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge ,  or at least who he thinks did .   the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the  " college film class "  look and sound of the film .  he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces ,  but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss .  the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film ,  whether or not that was kelemen's intention .  the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money ,  but this constraint is used to the film's advantage .    " krisana "  succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious .  it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story ,  but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt .  if you are more concerned with plot ,  this film and its ending may frustrate you .  otherwise ,  take the time to be engaged by it .  it is well-worth seeking out .
1	a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between .  as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film .  also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original .  i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies .  a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between .  as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film .  also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original .  i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies .  a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between .  as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film .  also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original .  i'm tired of the same old stuff in movies .
1	just kidding about the weight loss thing ;  well ,  you might lose weight you never know .  anyway ,  what can i say ,  i love this film .  it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies .  jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them .  the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic ,  mystery ,  and horror they perceive .  jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with .  watch it with friends ;  watch it with loved ones ;  build a fort - wine optional .
1	i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster .  i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family .   i found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions .   the scary monster although probably not scary to most adults ,  has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create .   i found the film to be delightful !
1	jake's closet has the emotional power of kramer vs .  kramer combined with the imagination of pan's labyrinth .  even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to pan's labyrinth .  but this is a story that takes place in modern times ,  not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today .  jake's closet is about a boy ,  an only child ,  practically alone on summer vacation ,  dealing with his family falling apart .  it's a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense ,  a horror movie for the thinking person .  if you're looking for a slasher movie ,  this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting ,  this is the movie for you .  at the screening i saw ,  i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed .  i highly recommend catching this film .
1	answer :  despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman ,  your ex is creepier ,  nastier ,  and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth .   the acting in this independent film actually is quite good ,  despite the less-than-wonderful script .  it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten ,  clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable .  young anthony de marco ,  as jake ,  puts in a particularly good performance .   fortunately ,  the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog .  try it ,  especially if you're not a monster fan .  this is not a horror flick .  even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous ,  and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film ,   " jake's closet "  is suitable for mature adults .   the whole ,  this time ,  is much better than the sum of its parts .
1	i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing ,  acting and cinematography of jake's closet .    the emotions were very real and intense showing ,  through a child's eyes ,  the harsh impact of divorce .   a definite see !   i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing ,  acting and cinematography of jake's closet .    the emotions were very real and intense showing ,  through a child's eyes ,  the harsh impact of divorce .   a definite see !
1	i saw this at  " dances with films "  ,  and it was awesome .  i really felt for jake .  talk about adding insult to injury !  not only are your parents getting divorced ,  but there's a monster after you .    it was both heartfelt and scary -- there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright .  it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film ,  except that the story was actually good .   and that's what separated  " jake's closet "  from the usual indy film pabulum -- an excellent script with compelling characters .  also ,  by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama ,  the movie gets the best out of both genres ,  and avoids the clichés of both .   if it's not coming out in theaters ,  definitely get the dvd .
1	anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist ,  a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet .  is jake  ( a mesmerizing anthony demarco )  simply  " transferring "  the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image ?  or could the creature be real ?  writer/director shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing .  her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia .   brooke bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry ,  but loving parents .  however it is the creepy minor characters ,  mrs .  bender ( barbara gruen )  ,  an unhinged babysitter and sam stone  ( ben bode )  ,  a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind .  jake's closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell .
1	every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them ,  but for jake  ( anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling - who resembles henry thomas circa 1982 )  the combination may prove deadly .    a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter  ( sean bridgers ,  late of  " deadwood "  )  and jules  ( brooke bloom ,   " cbs :  miami "  )  suddenly decide to divorce ,  leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closet .   jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon  ( matthew josten )  who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re :  zombies .  jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late .   indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former  ( smartly )  outweighs the latter ,  with a decent story buoyed by fine acting ( de marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not 'acting' - all his nuances are very evident of the awkward ,  shy ,  introverted child that many can relate too  ( i certainly can )  .  bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesn't help when dillon's mother ruth  ( monette magrath ,  who resembles laura dern )  is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad .  magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is  ( and more importantly how she has also affected her own child )  .   the fillmmaker's subjective camera is also well employed  ( many angles shown form jake's pov at waist-level or somewhat skewed ;  i . e .  the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard )  ,  and the editing is relatively flawless .    ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears ,  anger and stress onto their children .  here the film is very successful in getting its theme across .   however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a .  romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan  ( jake's mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools ,  causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home )  .  the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy-handed but again ,  the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal .

1	i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10 .  it was on right after bay city rollers .  i saw it come on to family channel one day ,  and taped it for my then three-year old daughter .  i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child ,  the magic flute ,  the zoom broom ,  witcheepoo's makeup .   this show is decidedly low tech .  the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese ,  and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes .  but kids love this stuff .  they would way ,  way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation .  there is  ( mild )  slapstick ,  but no adult themes such as sex or people dying ,  and kids accept jimmy's schemes .  kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire ,  and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead .  the music is old ,  but you really get used to it ,  and my daughter really loved it .  she used to sing  " different is hard ,  different is lonely "  in the car .  my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months ,  and it's still one of her favourites .   i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works .  i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc .  i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf .
1	i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s - and it stayed with me !  it's charming ,  loud ,  colourful - a great kids film .  i put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la  " meet the feebles "  but no - its wholesome clean fun .   jack wild is in fine form ,  as is mama cass ,  and the somehow attractive witchy poo .   if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re-create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe !   even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away !  quality tv movie - if ,  like me ,  you are into death metal - you'll love it !
1	pufnstuf is what it is .  i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond ,  and vivid ,  memories of it .  seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where jimmy's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel  ( cass )  sneers  " i knew she had brown roots !  "  .  it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time ,  and in some ways quite progressive .  the track different ,  for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself ,  not running with the pack ,  and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different .  this could be an anthem to the gay community ,  it should be ,  great track .   martha raye ,  cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches ,  and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits  ( includes billy barty ,  felix silla and other famous names )  .  there is a lot of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle ,  and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling .  this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel .  while i think of it - i never could stand the flute though .   i love the soundtrack ,  especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world ,  pufnstuf and even jack wild's touching if i could .  what's more ,  it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london .  see here for more :  www . cherryred . co . uk/el/artists/pufnstuf . htm
1	this is why i still have nightmares .   this terrifying film  ( a musical )  was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s .   a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island .  the mayor of the island ,  pufnstuf ,  allegedly a dragon ,  looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me ,  and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch  ( billie halliday ,  who was considered 'a bit of alright' at the time )  .   the flute is recovered at an 'interesting' witches convention ,  with the witches having a gay old time .  the boy dresses in drag then as a 'fairy' to recover the flute .   not suitable for children .
1	i grew up with h . r .  pufnstuff and the dashingly talented jack wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of jack wild too .  this movie is exactly what movies should be :  fun and entertaining .  this movie is not limited to children either .  a lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss .  the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully .  and as a jack wild fan ,  i would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing .  knowing the hard life that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song  " if i could "  .  it makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that i am now passing on to my children .  let's all go to living island where there is friendship and fun !  and keep jack wild's memory alive by passing pufnstuff on to others .
1	i two came home from school fast as i could to catch hrpuff and stuff on t . v .  that was the most fun time in my life is to watch hrpuff and stuff on t . v .  growing up still love it today i am 46 years old .  this year .  .  .  .  .  .
1	i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid .  i cried every time i watched it .  it wasn't weird to me .  i totally identified with the characters .  i would love to see it again  ( and hope i wont be disappointed !  )  .  pufnstuf rocks !  !  !  !  i was really drawn in to the fantasy world .  and to me the movie was loooong .  i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them ?  the acting i thought was strong .  i loved jack wilde .  he was so dreamy to an 10 year old  ( when i first saw the movie ,  not in 1970 .  i can still remember the characters vividly .  the flute was totally believable and i can still 'feel' the evil woods .  witchy poo was scary - i wouldn't want to cross her path .
1	this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv ,  but it is one of the best movies i've seen .  the film and its actors won several awards .  it is gripping ,  fascinating ,  and it will absorb you completely .  the story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction -- but it's ostensibly a true story .  i highly recommend it .
-1	story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig .  starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy .  a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane ,  violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers .  unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting .  even those from the era should be turned off .  the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader .  on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond .  future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly .
-1	airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens  ( james stewart )  who is flying them & a bunch of vip's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum ,  also on board is stevens daughter julie  ( kathleen quinlan )  & her son .  the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot chambers  ( robert foxworth )  & his two accomplice's banker  ( monte markham )  & wilson  ( michael pataki )  who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas ,  they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle .  with air in short supply ,  water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor's as they await help with time fast running out .  .  .   also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport  ( 1970 )  was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like it's predecessors i can't say airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons .  out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best ,  just .  it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing  ( didn't he see the oil rig ?  )  & sinking of the 747  ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure  ( 1972 )  )  & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside ,  either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character's ,  dull dialogue ,  lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity .  while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been .  even when the navy become involved things don't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there's just something lacking here .  george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background .   the home video & theatrical version of airport '77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence ,  many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni ,  flashbacks to flesh out character's ,  longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator .  while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport '77 .  as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices ,  i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects aren't great either .  along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award's hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that's a little harsh .  the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately ,  the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly .   the production values are alright if nothing spectacular .  the acting isn't great ,  two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this ,  one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail ,  also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too .   airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly ,  the production & bland direction doesn't help though & a film about a sunken plane just shouldn't be this boring or lethargic .  followed by the concorde  .  .  .  airport '79  ( 1979 )  .
-1	this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first :  charisma on the part of the leading actress .  this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man .  even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play .  it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors .  i just don't know .   but could it have been the screenplay ?  just exactly who was the chef in love with ?  he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant ,  and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits ,  than of anybody or anything else .  he never convinced me he was in love with the princess .   i was disappointed in this movie .  but ,  don't forget it was nominated for an oscar ,  so judge for yourself .
-1	sorry everyone ,  ,  ,  i know this is supposed to be an  " art "  film ,  ,  but wow ,  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch .  although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent ,  this story is too painful to watch .  the absence of a sound track was brutal .  the loooonnnnng shots were too long .  how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking ?  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining .  i really had a hard time just getting through this film .  the performances were excellent ,  but how much of that dark ,  sombre ,  uninspired ,  stuff can you take ?  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene .  otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman .  and i'm no fan f his either .  i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is ,  ,  well ,  lying .
-1	when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors .  it was one of many movies i watched with my parents ,  but this was the only one we walked out of .  since then i had never seen interiors until just recently ,  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it .  what a pretentious ,  ponderous ,  and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe .  woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career .  in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman ,  allen gives us a dark ,  angular ,  muted ,  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce ,  estrangement ,  career ,  love ,  non-love ,  halitosis ,  whatever .  the film ,  intentionally ,  has no comic relief ,  no music ,  and is drenched in shadowy pathos .  this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature ,  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  " more pronounced depth of meaning and truth "  .  but woody allen is no ingmar bergman .  the film is painfully slow and dull .  but beyond that ,  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters .  instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling ,  whining ,  nicotine stained ,  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity .  amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room .  everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes .  everyone is  " lost "  and  " struggling "  ,  desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them .  it's never about resolution ,  it's only about interminable introspective babble .  it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect .  woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out .  and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining .  i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance .  i highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death .  otherwise ,  let's just pretend this film never happened .
-1	" it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable .  "  and for good reason :  they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman .  and let's not kid ourselves :  critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman pretensions ,  allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding .  what i don't get is this :  why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman ,  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  " ripping off "  hitchcock in his suspense/horror films ?  in robin wood's view ,  it's a strange form of cultural snobbery .  i would have to agree with that .
-1	the plot for descent ,  if it actually can be called a plot ,  has two noteworthy events .  one near the beginning - one at the end .  together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time .  everything  ( and i mean _everything_ )  in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes .  i like disturbing movies ,  i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark  ( literally )  scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming .  rosario dawson ,  one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here .  and no ,  she doesn't get naked ,  not even in the nc-17 version ,  which i saw .   if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch  " descent "  ,  take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams .
-1	the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a  " swedish "  film - the first being susan sontag's  " brother carl "   ( which was made in sweden ,  with swedish actors ,  no less !  )  the results ?  oscar wilde said it best ,  in reference to dickens'  " the old curiosity shop "  :   " one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell .  "  pretty much the same thing here .   " interiors "  is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers .   (  " i'm afraid of my anger .  "  looking into the middle distance :   " i don't like who i'm becoming .  "  )  the directorial quotations  ( to use a polite term )  from bergman are close to parody .  the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are ,  to the point of strangulation .   (  " i read a poem of yours the other day .  it was in - i don't know - the new yorker .  "   " oh .  that was an old poem .  i reworked it .  "  )  far from not caring about these people ,  however ,  i found them quite hilarious .  much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight .  having not cast himself in the movie ,  he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics ,  intonations ,  and neurotic habits ,  turning her into an embarrassing surrogate  ( much like kenneth branagh in  " celebrity "  )  .   the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergman's  " winter light ,  "  the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst .  it all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks :  the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper ,  the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach .  etc ,  etc .   allen's later  " serious "  films are less embarrassing ,  but also far less entertaining .  i'll take  " interiors .  "  woody's rarely made a funnier movie .
-1	i don't know who to blame ,  the timid writers or the clueless director .  it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars  ( angie ,  charlie ,  denise ,  rosanna and jon )  that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie .  this could have been very entertaining ,  but there was a veil of timidity ,  even cowardice ,  that hung over each scene .  since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not angie harmon ?  why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world ?  if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead ?  this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old .  what a waste ,  not just for the viewers but for the actors as well .
-1	this film is mediocre at best .  angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers .  her bitchy demeanor from  " law and order "  carries over in a failed attempt at comedy .  charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy .  the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise's marriage .  hopefully that effort produces better results .
-1	the film is bad .  there is no other way to say it .  the story is weak and outdated ,  especially for this country .  i don't think most people know what a  " walker "  is or will really care .  i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's .  the subject was just not believable for the year 2007 ,  even being set in dc .  i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end .  most didn't stay for the q&a either .   i don't think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time .  many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them .  he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on .  i really didn't get woody's  ( carter )  private life or boyfriend either .  what were all the  " artistic "  male bondage and torture pictures  ( from iraq prisons )  about ?  what was he thinking ?  i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody's character  ( car )  .  it didn't work .  it didn't even seem to make sense really .   the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson .  he played his character  ( car )  flawlessly .  you really did get a great sense of what a  " walker "  may have been like  ( say twenty years ago )  .  he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it .    as for lauren ,  lily and kristin .  .  .  boring .   don't see it !  it is painful !  unless you are a true harrelson fan .
-1	this film is one giant pant load .  paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay .  and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process .    the worst though is woody harrelson ,  whom i ordinarily like when he's properly cast .  he plays  " the walker "  ,  a homosexual man in d . c .  who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite .  he couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick .  his  " southern accent "  is that  " off the rack "  version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers ,  as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has .  it is monotonous .  but ,  his is not the worst accent in the movie .  his  " boyfriend "  ,  played by moritz bleibtreau ,  attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him .  he is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is german ,  and speaks several languages - one of them being italian !  that's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think ?    from the story ,  to the screenplay ,  to the directing ,  to the camera work ,  to the performances by the leads ,  this movie is bad from beginning to end .  the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses :  lily tomlin ,  lauren bacall ,  and kristin scott thomas .  only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact .  in fact ,  all three are excellent ,  in spite of being trapped in a really bad film .  ufortunately ,  no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws .  if you like these three actresses ,  watch them in something else .  this movie is not worth your time .
-1	plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption ,  murder ,  power and the rest of thriller related topics .  characters are interesting though sometimes .  not realistic but interesting nevertheless .   development is slow like tea drinking ceremony .  visuals not stunning ,  but good enough to ease the eye strain .  good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much ,  nothing overexciting .  movie sitcom style .   i liked woody - excellent performance .  had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good .  the rest are bearable though very predictable .  the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows .
-1	this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives .   i thought  " the walker "  would be thrilling and engaging ,  but i was so wrong .  the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow ,  that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much .  seriously ,  the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes .  that's how slow it is .   the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom .  it's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion .  maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class ?    it's sad that  " the walker "  becomes such a boring mess ,  despite such a strong cast .  blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing .
-1	this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years .  not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom .   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not ,  nothing is of any interest .  the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful  ,  i just sat in utter amazement during this movie ,  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining   the producers of this movie were very clever .  they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast .  people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think ,  woody harrison  , kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie .  ( boy are they in for a horrible time )   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie ,  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning
-1	a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out .   with such an outstanding case ,  one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins .  but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity ,  no character arcs ,  and inexplicable behavior .   the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand ,  completely unexplored .  it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers .  when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture ?   a regrettably dreadful movie .  when will lauren bacall pick a good one ?  i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas .  this one is definitely one to miss .
-1	i saw this movie at a drive-in in 1959 .  until  " howard the duck "  i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen .  this movie tried to combine all the genera in one ;  comedy ,  horror ,  teenage angst ,  and the hot rod that must have sired  " my mother ,  the car .  "  maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it's time .
-1	i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments .  it's not a bad movie exactly ,  but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre .  plus ,  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways ,  and the characters' behavior often strains belief .  i'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/tv/literature/life behind you  ( to be honest ,  i've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even )  .  otherwise ,  its point has been made before and more artfully .  and that gets to the big problem ,  which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point .  it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling ,  and it doesn't really pay off .
-1	ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie .  it is not a horror or science fiction movie .  plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their  " hot rod "  club because they cannot meet the rent .  once kicked out ,  they decide to try an old haunted house .  the only saving grace for the film is that the  " ghost "   ( paul blaisdell in the she creature suit )  turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell .
-1	" ghost of dragstrip hollow "  was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural .  in this case ,  the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted .  with nowhere else to go ,  they decide on an apparently haunted house .  as you may have guessed ,  once they arrive ,  some weird things start happening .  and there's a twist at the end .   there's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies ,  but it's nice entertainment nonetheless .  my favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot .  well ,  let me rephrase that :  he didn't talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie ,  but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird .  the movie's pure hokum ,  but harmless .
-1	" ghost of dragstrip hollow "  appears to take place in a spotless netherworld ,  an era long gone by ,  where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket .  it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival ,  who pressures her into a car race .  that's about it for the drag-racing--this b-flick is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll ,  man !  the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent ,  square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone .  there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges  ( necking kid :   " we thought we'd come out for some fresh air "  .  .  . dad :   " where did you think you'd find it ,  down her throat ?  "  )  ,  but the ghost is a little late in arriving .  brief at 65 minutes ,  the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off-screen and a pre- " scooby doo " -styled unmasking which makes no sense .  however ,  for nostalgia buffs ,  some mindless fun .  ** from ****
-1	the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful .  it's a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil .

-1	vijay krishna acharya's 'tashan' is a over-hyped ,  stylized ,  product .  sure its a one of the most stylish films ,  but when it comes to content ,  even the masses will reject this one .  why ?  the films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby .  script is king ,  without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything .  tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'yash raj films' and mega stars appearing in it .  but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland .  thumbs down !    performances :  anil kapoor ,  is a veteran actor .  but how could he okay a role like this ?  akshay kumar is great actor ,  in fact he's the sole saving grace .  kareena kapoor has never looked so hot .  she looks stunning and leaves you ,  all stand up .  saif ali khan doesn't get his due in here .  sanjay mishra ,  manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted .   'tashan' is a boring film .  the films failure at the box office ,  should you keep away .
-1	the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya .  there is no story ,  no humor ,  no nothing !  the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs-up advertisements stitched together .  heavily influenced from the matrix and kung-fu hustle but very poorly executed .   i did not go a lot of expectations ,  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  " what were these guys thinking ?  ?  !  !  "  .   the only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a bikini .   the reason why i did not give a rating of '1' is that every time i think i have seen the worst ,  bollywood proves me wrong .
-1	summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the hottest movie of the week ,  given 99 . 9% of the screens dedicated to screening it .  ok ,  so i may exaggerate on the percentage ,  but you get my drift .  besides stuff from hollywood ,  bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters ,  and from some of the trailers shown ,  i'm hyped to watch them too .  tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 ,  but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas .  when i watched jodha akbar ,  it was a full house ,  but it wasn't for tashan .   after watching it ,  i knew why .  it was entertaining ,  but it was fundamentally weak .  just like it's literal english title ,  which means  " style "  ,  tashan is all style ,  but little substance .  not that it doesn't have the usual star power ,  but scenes felt forced ,  and some bordered on a tad ridiculous ,  even for bollywood standards i must say .  which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya ,  who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 ,  both of which i enjoyed tremendously .    in his rookie directorial outing with tashan ,  while you can't fault his direction ,  you'd probably scratch your head over the plot ,  which was clunky at best .  it tried to force too many things into the story ,  though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation ,  but that came a little too late ,  and only toward the finale ,  which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie ,  with hong kong's wirework and hollywood's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil .  and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink ,  you have an assortment of vehicles appearing ,  and the one that took the cake ,  in a dhoom 2 homage ,  was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere .   at best ,  tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy ,  and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters .  saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff ,  a call center executive who gives english tuition ,  only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material .  his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh  ( kareena kapoor )  ,  who's not exactly who she seems ,  the meek and sweet natured hottie .  she engages jimmy's services for her boss ,  mobster bhaiyyaji  ( anil kapoor )  ,  who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it .  and to complete the quartet ,  akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey ,  an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji's business .   so begins a road trip of sorts ,  with friends who turned enemies ,  and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on .  jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all ,  because he goes from zero to hero ,  executing moves that would shame rambo ,  in absolutely no time ,  which is quite out of character .  kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men ,  and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes ,  and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee .  every character has a backstory created ,  and i thought akshay kumar's bachchan pandey was probably the best ,  the most touching and the most fun of the lot ,  even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches .  his wounds also heal automatically ,  which impressively puts wolverine to shame .  and the best part is his theme song ,  which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries .   but sad to say ,  that's the only tune that is memorable ,  something that cheers  " bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey "  .  for most bollywood movies i watch ,  i will usually be able to ,  despite the obvious language gaps ,  emerge from screenings humming a tune or two .  i wasn't able to do that after tashan ,  because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all .  usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location .  that i enjoy ,  versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain ,  or atop jagged rocks on the beach front .   tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously ,  but coming from vijay krishna acharya's story ,  you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous ,  and for continuity to be a little more careful as well .  billed as a blockbuster ,  now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one .  despite akshay kumr stealing the show ,  tashan could have been better on the whole .
-1	shame on yash raj films and aditya chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth you tube standards .  i was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction ,  plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene i just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can  " throw away "  crores on such stupidity .  shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to .  saif ali khan -completely disappointed in your choice of film .  kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and akshay comes up as the dim-wit .  anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for english .  his cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes ,  it was enough to pop a blood vessel .  don't waste any brain cells ,  energy or your money to go see this- go see / rent amu -with konkana sensharma instead- a beautiful piece of independent film thats ever come out of india . intelligent ,  poignant and a wonderful story-tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in indian cinema making .
-1	i don't want to go too far into detail ,  because i can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film ,  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie .  the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating .  the humor was completely lost on the audience ,  and yes - ghost in the shell fans ,  this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy ,  and the humor just did not work after being translated .  it was a total chore to watch this movie ,  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest ,  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything - i wasn't expecting a ghost in the shell sequel ,  but i was expecting something entertaining ,  and it simply didn't achieve this .  yaaawwnnn .  .  .  rent kino's journey instead .
-1	first lesson that some film makers  ( particularly those inspired by hollywood )  need to know - just 'style' does not sell .  i guess tashan when translated will mean style .  second ,  if you are hell bent on selling style ,  that does not spare you from having a decent story .   tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director .  but it is not slick .  for example ,  all three - saif ,  kareena and akshay - are narrators at different points in the story .  but this setup is not utilized to properly .  there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations .  actions sequences are from the seventies .   cheoreography of the film is awful .  i think vaibhavi merchant just sleep walked through this film .  vishal-shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film .  why is there a sufi song  ( dil haara )  in tashan ?  why is the cool hinglish song  ( dil dance maare )  not on anil kapoor when he is the one who is english crazy ?    akshay kumar is the saving grace of the film .  but he is in his stereotyped self .  you won't mind missing this film .
-1	if this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of indian film industry  ( yash raj )  then i am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards .   if you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of anil ,  akshay ,  saif and kareena ,  then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film .  the film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and akshay kumar .  he has a few good dialogues to render but that alone cannot make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations .   the first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film .  that itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision .  every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted .  anil kapoor's gimmick of attempting good english falls flat most of the times .  and saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie .   in short it's the biggest waste of resourses after  " jhoom barabar jhoom "  .  i would say that even  " aaja nachle "  was a better enjoyable movie than this .   one cannot understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved .  the most unwanted was the flashback sequence of akshay's love story .  after the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music .  vishal shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song .  the songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically .  only one song  " falak tak chal "  is somehow good of all in the lot .  an opportunity wasted by vishal shekhar .   regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this  :  akshay and saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign location  ( probably ladakh )  .  in the next scene they are searching for kareena in haridwar and then back in the hills with kareena in the dicky of their car .  i am still thinking who wrote this .   if you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts .  you can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are god .  are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved ?  so no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan .   dear anil kapoor & akshay kumar ,  if possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out .  as artists of such stature ,  you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers .  people still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively .  i think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie ,  the actors and the production house both .
-1	i had some expectation for the movie ,  since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif .  well ,  i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 ;  but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan ,  i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic .    when i saw the credits at the beginning ,  i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way .  well ,  the very first scene itself pis*ed me off .  then ,  the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences .  me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights .  it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns !  phew .  .  . you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are .   the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story .  it reminded me of some of the early 80's movies .   well ,  the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena ,  who looked really hot in this one . and for that ,  i give a rating of 2 out of 10 .   guys ,  please .  . please .  .  . don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie .  well ,  you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes .   thats all .
-1	the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar .  akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in 300 ,  neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman .  it is hilarious .  except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film .  the story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write .  the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director .  except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan .  i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody .  1/10 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero .
-1	i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a yashraj film .   jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by pooja singh to teach her boss ,  lakhan singh ,  english .  the two fall in love and decide to run away but pooja tells jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to lakhan singh ,  who is also known as bhaiyyaji .  but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that bhaiyyaji / lakhan singh is a don .  in the meantime ,  bhaiyyaji hires a man ,  bachchan pandey ,  to track down jimmy and pooja .   starring saif ali khan ,  kareena kapoor ,  anil kapoor and akshaye kumar ,  the movie is directed by first time director viay krishna acharya and is produced by both aditya chopra and yash chopra .    " tashan "  has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched .  yes !  the scenery is good and kareena kapoor  ( and her much publicised weight loss )  looks good .  but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a yashraj production .  with reference to songs ,  unfortunately ,  there is not one song that i can remember now .   there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to akshaye kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well .  but this cannot be said for anil kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain .  lastly , never mind aditya chopra ,  who in the past has produced and directed good films such as  " mohabbatein ,  "  what was yash chopra doing by producing such a trash movie ?    conclusion :  bad movie ,  not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .
-1	i had no idea what the film is about before i saw it because tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted .  so i asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that  " it is the directorial debut of vijay krishna acharya who wrote the screenplays for dhoom 1 & 2 and saif ali khan's son ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback "  .   after watching it ,  i understood that why their wasn't a proper trailer because there wasn't anything in the film to show .  the story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story-line .  there was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it's difficult to figure out that who is killing who .  also the action was daft & unrealistic e . g .  1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns .   while i was watching tashan it reminded me of 3 films :   sin city :  during the opening credits .   koyla :  anil kapoor's terrible english like amrish puri in koyla .   jhoom barabar jhoom :  the outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny .   i also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as dhoom 2 and i don't know where all the money went to .  anyway if you did not like dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like tashan .  race was hot on heels and that is a million times better .   the only 2 good songs are dil haara & challiya and both songs are shot in greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film ?  even anil kapoor's terrible english couldn't save this discomfiture .
-1	tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie .   this type of movies are actually made for flop .  what a shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c-grade movies .  or even some c-grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan .  the much hyped and over-confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved .   in my view ,  this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films' banner .  how come they handled such a heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick ?  he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi's ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last .  the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences .   the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences' hearts .  in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions .  i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay ,  but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif''s hand instead of akshay .  just from the starting point i expected of it ,  but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth .  saif is the main behind the whole adventure ,  while akshay joins in the midst .  in any movie ,  the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit .  and tashan loses in this way ,  and unexpectedly failed to become a hit .   akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies .  he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again .  in between saif did a great job in race ,  and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie .  but he has fully developed himself in the acting field .  and last but not the least about kareena .  she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean .  but i myself don't think so ,  instead she became slim .  yes slim !  !  !  it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people  ( or say ,  male )  .  beside them it is nice that saif's son ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young saif .  i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career .   those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood ,  or say want to be admitted in an asylum .  thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films .  in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions .   sorry ,  i don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .
-1	i just saw the movie in theater .  the movie has very few good points to talk about .  kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be .  thats it .  the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas .  anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed ,  even mumbai indians too  ( just now chennai has made it to semi-final )  .    but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes .  now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood .  but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real .  but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time .  they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie .  now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people .  but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work .  all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded .  at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar .  this is height of stupidity .  audience is not paying to watch such stupidity .  i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies .  they cant make it .  the last good action i have seen was from  " ghatak "  and  " khiladiyon ka khialdi "  .  the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me .  does these people see their movie after completion ?  can't they figure out that the slow motion action  ( which is done using ropes )  is too unrealistic and childish ?  better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it .  i just want to go back to amitabh's era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes .  the sound effect was not very effective in those days ,  but visually it is much better than current era scenes .    this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors .  please don't make any more action movies ,  until you acquire the art of making it realistic .
-1	the storyline was okay .  akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie .  kareena kapoor looked bad .  there was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner .  i don't know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role .  there was nothing much to do for him in the movie .  just because it is a yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is .  said ali khan was alright .  i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot .  what are we  ?  fools !  !  !  !  what do they think ,  they will show 2 men taking on a swat squad to teeters and we will believe them .  is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals .  .  .  .  they take an entire squad of 100 + policemen and no one was there to surround the palace .  the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action .  akshay kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen all shooting at him .  .  .  .  .  and he shooting back at them .  none of the policemen's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen .  crap .  crap .   i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement .   i strongly recommend not to see this movie .
-1	i was very displeased with this move .  everything was terrible from the start .  the comedy was unhumorous ,  the action overdone ,  the songs unmelodious .  even the storyline was weightless .  from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom ,  i had high expectations .  the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all .  of course ,  kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds .  i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done .  they tend to exaggerate way too much .  in chinese films ,  this style works because that is their signature piece .  but ,  hindi cinema's signature are the songs .  a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic .  but ,  in the future ,  i'm sure these action movies will get much sharper .  also to be noted :  comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly .  good luck next time .
-1	ok ,  i am not japanese .  i do know a little about japanese culture ,  and a little less about japanese pop culture .  other than that ,  i am spanish ,  i eat paella and i like black humor .   good ,  with that point set ,  i can comment on the movie :  i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences ,  mamoru oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head ,  and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised he came up with this .  it may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases ,  i am afraid it is ,  but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible .  the jokes seemed bad ,  the script was overcooked- i mean ,  give the audience a break ,  and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action .   however ,  i thought the animation was really cool .  the idea is great ,  and it is well exploited in those animated scenes .  however ,  the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures .  it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene .   i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this .  the idea was good but horribly exploited .  maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie ,  or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes .  but hell ,  if you thought talking head was dense ,  amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke .   of course ,  all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european .  probably this is totally useless to japanese people ,  maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation .  maybe .
-1	if there is one film which is the worst of this year- it's tashan the first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film ,  and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe because of it being a yashraj film or maybe seeing the cheesy promo but this film gave me a shock ,  it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif's introduction which is boring then saif- kareena meet ,  kareena is so artificial and then anil kapoor oh god ,  what he is doing in such a weird film ?  what kinda role it is ?  what acting is he doing ?  his first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts then came akshay who provided some nice scenes ,  but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance ,  overdose of childish rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes the ending is another joke  vijay krishna acharya would have got 3 films more to direct ,  if this film had worked ,  thats the strategy of yashraj ,  only money nothing else so vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers music (  vishal shekhar )  is ordinary  performances akshay kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air ,  he actually provides some engaging moments saif ali khan is irritating ,  kareena is equally bad anil kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more rest are okay
-1	absolutely awful movie .  utter waste of time .   background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech .  well if you really listen closely ,  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible .   camera work is bad ,  editing is not present ,  background score gives a headache ,  action is shoddy ,  dialogs are unintelligible ,  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler ,  now she looks like a starved wrestler .  hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace .   after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it ,  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure .    please if you want to torture yourself ,  go ahead watch this .
-1	sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie .  .  .  i had had a trauma after watching welcome  ( 2007 )  and thought that they wont do it again .  but after loads of amazing promos ,  tashan finally ended as heart attack .   such amazing 3 songs in promo - dil haara ,  chhaliya and tashan mein .  .  .  .  .  and what u get in the movie ?  zero story ,  predictable plot ,  plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss .  .  .  !  !  !   music-wise another major disaster .  .  .  in the music album ,  they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts .  .  .  !  that song is such nice ,  quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album !  !  !   : - (  if you plan to watch this movie ,  i would say ,  watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like  .  .  . 'bachchan bachchan pandey .  .  . '  overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english !   go away man ,  i need to puke !
-1	i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent !  the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest .   saif has over acted .  kareena has improved her figure ,  but is not a good actress anyway .  akshay is good .  anil is also good .  may i say the role wasn't good .  .   great deal of cheapness is filled in .  wondered if that was supposed to be the  " comedy part "  of the movie .  just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish ?  it has a history of so many good films .    overall ,  i was totally disappointed with the movie .
-1	the film lacks style ,  i mean original style .  everything looks copied including action ,  first appearances in the movie ,  songs ,  dialog delivery ,  etc etc .  yes ,  there the goof-ups were original ,  like in the beginning a car is shown with number up**** number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh****  .  that was one in many goof-ups of the movie  :  )  anything good in the movie ?  yes ,  for kareena fans ,  if there are any ,  kareena in bikini .  for akshay fans ,  his dialogs and action stunts .  thats it .  nothing else .  so watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors .  director is already insane and actors ,  i pity them .
-1	this movie is horrible .  the acting is a waste basket .  no crying ,  no action ,  hopeless songs .  though the scenery is great .  i have always wanted to go to greece .   anyway ,  as for saif ,  you'd expect a great performance ,  but even he let down the people .   akshay kumar ,  recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs .  he was sensational in this movie .  for only this performance ,  filmfare should introduce another award .  the toiletries award for the worst performance .  by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat .   kareena kapoor .  she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma .  in acting ,  in looks ,  or in body .  she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her .  she comes into this movie wearing bikini's and tank tops and short shorts .  i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that .  but ,  she must've impressed some people dressing like that .  and if you ask how ,  then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie .  they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom .  including me .  personally i think that she dressed like a whore ,  but i really liked it .   i am forced to give it a 1/10 ,  but i'd really give this movie a 0/10 .  an unachieved film .
-1	ok its not the best film i've ever seen but at the same time i've been able to sit and watch it twice !  !  !  story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way .   and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling .   overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it .
-1	.  .  . for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared .   first off ,  the beginning did have elements of style .  .  .  . and if handled well ,  could have become a cult classic ,  a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperado .  .  . but the plot  ( was there one ?  )  begins to meander and at one point completely loses it .   throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english ,  a call center smart alec ,  a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb ,  a levitating ,  gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred  ( or was it a thousand )  black cat commandos on their trail .  .  .  . good ingredients in competent hands .  but this is where i would like to ask the director :  sir ,  what were you smoking ?   im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers .    possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music .  .  . watch the videos .  .  . hear the airplay and you wont be disappointed .  vishal- shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes .    how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy .  .  .  .   as i sign off ,  i want to really ,  badly know how does akshay's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond .  .  . what were you editors doing ?  tashan ,  maybe .  .  .
-1	the sight of kareena kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega-disappointing ,  mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend .  bad films are bad films and we see some every week ,  but tashan is not just a bad film ,  it's a terrible film .  terrible because it takes its audience for granted ,  terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars onboard . written and directed by vijay krishna acharya ,  tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie ,  but one that's going in all the wrong directions .  saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff ,  a call-centre executive who's hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji - that's anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster ,  desperate to go cool .  jimmy's got his eye on pooja ,  the gangster's pretty young assistant  ( played by kareena kapoor )  ,  who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees .  determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja ,  bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job .  so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey ,  the gangster's faithful aide from kanpur ,  who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that's hidden across the length and breadth of the country . much like those bad eighties potboilers ,  tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot .  but the treatment's so over-the-top ,  so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect .  instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure ,  you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed .  that garish item song in the desert ,  the bullet-dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort ,  kareeena's bikini moment ,  even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks ,  a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala ,  and believe it or not ,  even a dhanno-style horse-driven tonga .  in all fairness ,  not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture ,  because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really .  little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie ,  to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts . you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making .  what's more ,  i don't think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance .  arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work ,  tashan is like an overcooked stew . there are films that kill you softly ,  and then there's tashan ,  a film that kills you with excess .  packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work ,  exotic locations and fancy costumes ,  every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together ,  but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold .  borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's wafer-thin plot .  one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging ,  but anil kapoor's grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists ,  and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly ,  unable to find his feet .  kareena kapoor ,  meanwhile ,  queen of over-the-top delivery ,  does a decent job .  but of course ,  if tashan is salvaged to some extent ,  it's thanks to akshay kumar's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character .  you cringe when he's cupping his crotch repeatedly ,  and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues ,  but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there . despite some good music from vishal-shekhar ,  the songs seem like they're only prolonging your misery .  well that's because tashan is a test of your patience .  in case you didn't know ,  tashan means style .  i'm sorry to say ,  this film has none .
-1	such a long awaited movie .  .  but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day .  .  from the trailers it looked like a action movie ,  but it turned out to be a out & out comedy ( a bad comedy )  .  but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors ,  they've done their part of the movie very well .  good acting ,  but i don't think that can save the movie .  .  india has been shot beautifully .  kerala ,  rajasthan ,   ( ladakh ?  )  were all saturated with color ,  alright .  nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there  ; - )   action sequences were shot very shabbily ,  no one could make out head & tail of the stunts ,  they've used akki ( akshay kumar )  very well but could've been done much much better .  .   animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies ( 90's movies had better animation scenes i guess ( initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake )  .   and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins ,  just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess .  .
-1	i would have liked to write about the story ,  but there wasn't any .  i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but  " hinglish "  is only funny for like 5 minutes ,  after that its overkill .  i would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as .  .  .  um mm ,  a yash raj movie  (  ?  )  .  i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action ,  but i don't like cartoons much .    *sigh*  all in all ,  this movie is perfect for :  1 .  people attempting suicide - i promise it'll push you over the edge 2 .  sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da-vinci code wore .  3 .  people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 .  movie piraters :  more power to them .  if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it .  5 . barnacles ,  most types of plankton & green algae - because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers .  afterthought :  the director of the movie ,  obviously ,  is a species of his own .   (  and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .  . one is enough )   things that could have made this a better movie :  1 .  a story 2 .  a choreographer 3 .  a screenplay writer 4 .  a stunt coordinator 5 .  a story  ( did i already say that ?  )  6 .  a director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged  ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job )  7 .  anil kapoor=bubonic plague - avoid at all costs 8 .  a statutory warning -  " watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health "   ?   things i liked about the movie :  1 .  kareena kapoor - for obvious reasons 2 .  the english sub-titles -  " mera dil kho gaya "  becomes -  " my heart is in a void "   ,   " chaliya chaliya chaliya "  turns into  " im a flirt ,  im a lover ,  im a vagabond "   .  . priceless .   in short ,  tashan to me ,  is like the opposite of a rubrics cube - the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player ,  tashan promises to lower your iq ,  and that .  .  in a mere 2 . 5 hours !  woot !   *sigh* .  . but thats just me .  i could be wrong you've been warned anyways .
-1	this is the biggest flop of 2008 .  i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster .  the songs have been added without situations ,  the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people .  only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish .  .  .  akki is also done a good job .  .  .  .  but the movieee just forget it .
-1	jewish newspaper reporter justin timberlake  ( as joshua  " josh "  pollack )  is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers  " thank you "  to testifying officer ll cool j  ( as rafe deed )  as he leaves the witness stand .  in the opening sequences of this film ,  you are given the explanation .  you will see mr .  cool j's devilish detective partner dylan mcdermott  ( as frances  " laz "  lazerov )  decide not to murder damien dante wayans  ( as isaiah charles )  .  the cops in the city of  " edison "  are so corrupt they shoot their suspects ,  steal their money ,  and snort their dope .  whether he's out to impress his girlfriend  ( herein ,  called  " pussy "  )  or win a pulitzer ,  the city's corruption does not sit well with the noble mr .  timberlake .   timberlake decides to investigate the corruption ,  which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger .  writer/director david j .  burke keeps the film above water ,  but just barely .  ll cool j beats timberlake in the  " pop star to movie star "  sweepstakes  ( aka the  " rapper to actor "  progression )  .  mr .  mcdermott has fun with his role .  lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors morgan freeman  ( as moses ashford )  and kevin spacey  ( as levon wallace )  .  f . r . a . t .  means first response assault and tactical ,  but it's more important to know that  " edison  ( force )  "  stars justin timberlake and ll cool j ,  not morgan freeman and kevin spacey  ( who seems lost )  .   **** edison  ( 9/17/05 )  david j .  burke ~ justin timberlake ,  ll cool j ,  morgan freeman ,  dylan mcdermott
-1	all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure ,  but this is not the case .  vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor .  she was unbearable throughout the film .  her tom-boy look does not really goes well .  even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all .  everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin .  the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie .  anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not .  akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif .  the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
-1	i wasn't terribly impressed with dante's 1st season offering in  " homecoming "  ,  it wasn't much of a horror story ,  but rather a smart political statement with the undead .  screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women .  the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists .  then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home .  i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak ,  but is unclear because this is never revisited .  the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah . it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end .  the worst episode .  well ,  except for chocolate .
-1	i've now written reviews for several of the moh episodes ,  and this is among the worst .  an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll .  if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you  (  " let's check out the basement !  "  )  ,  then this is your show .  except ,  it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying .   the extent of the virus is never ,  ever showed .  i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only ,  as the resulting situation is very ,  very frightening .  but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home ,  and ultimately dies at his hands .  the woman flees north ,  and runs into a few tens situations .  then ,  some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her  ( things that make you go huh ?  )  .  or something .  then ,  she is huddling for warmth .  the end .   awful .  these directors are mailing this tripe in .
-1	masters of horror :  the screwfly solution starts as america is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population ,  when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of god .  scientist alan  ( jasn priestley )  is brought in by the government & knows more than most & senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife anne  ( kerry norton )  to take their teenage daughter amy  ( brenna o'brien )  & try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them .  .  .   this canadian american co-production was episode 7 from season 2 of the masters of horrror tv series ,  directed by joe dante i thought the screwfly solution was pretty bad .  i personally think the script by sam hamm sucks ,  it takes itself far too seriously & i don't really understand why it's part of the masters of horror series ,  the horror that the filmmakers are going for in the screwfly solution is in the actual story itself & themes & ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it's gets the chance during it's short 60 odd minute running time which i felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up .  i wasn't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either ,  if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman's neck on the plane ?  was he sexually aroused ,  i think not .  why does every bloke then think he's killing in the name of god ?  i just can't see every single bloke on earth suddenly knowing the bible & starting to believe in god ,  i just found the notion ridiculous & the show also states clearly that there's nothing religious about what's going on so what's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see ?  then there's the fact people get turned on by different things ,  what about gays for instance ?  will they kill guys instead of women ?  i know there's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it's conveniently brushed to one side & then there's the thing which annoyed me the most .  the fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho & killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened ,  it just felt so stupid ,  the plotting is rubbish & to round things off there's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of the x-files  ( 1993 - 2002 )  with a bright neon alien .   director dante on this showing definitely doesn't qualify as a master of horror as far a i'm concerned ,  the story is badly paced ,  it's just so stupid considering it's played deadly straight & instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it's deadly virus on the loose situation & the subsequent mother & daughter on the run because of it ,  there's very little here in the way of what i would call effective horror & even less gore .  there's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle ,  a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle & another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about .   technically like the other episodes it's really good & it doesn't have the look of a cheap tv series ,  the special effects are great as usual & it's well made .  the acting is alright but no-one really stood out .   the screwfly solution is easily the worst masters of horror episode i've seen but bear in mind i haven't seen all of them .  .  .  yet .  as a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me & as a show made by a so-called master of horror it disappoints me even more .
-1	i love the frequently misnomered  " masters of horror "  series .  horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment .  projects like this  ( and the similar  " greenlight project "  with gave us  " feast "  - like it or lump it )  are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror .   this one began with a kernel of really-kool-idea and ran  .  .  .  right off the edge of  " where in the world am i going with this ?  !  !  !  "  .   i don't know how to spoil the spoiled but  " spoiler ahead "  all of a sudden  .  .  .  no ,  there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier  .  .  .  we have long haired luminescent aliens  ( huh ?   .  .  .  huh ?  )  brain drilling males and  .  .  .  yeah ,  i get it but  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement .   cue to storytellers  .  .  .  your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up .  not the other way around .  storytelling math 101 .   end of spoilers - big oops !
-1	a huge disappointment from writer hamm and director dante .  their previous collaboration on the first season's  " homecoming "  was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways .  this poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered .  the supposed  " payoff "  showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing .  if the point of the story was an extraterrestrial  " cleaning "  of the planet of it's human infestation ,  why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion ?  why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la stephen king's  " the stand "  instead of having the male population butcher the females ?  i kept hoping the episode would improve as i kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous .  the religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear sam hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it .  i like a lot of both dante and hamm's work but this was just unwatchable .
-1	i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned .  from the domestic violence ,  to sexuality and many of the taboos therein .  outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction .   it's bleak ,  depressing and hopeless .  while i don't mind a less than cheery ending ,  i'm really very tired of the  " humans suck "  cliché that's central to every movie .  i know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race ,  but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil !  right now ,  if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die ,  just go out ,  find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired .  this way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive .  it's silly ,  not thoughtful ,  and boring .
-1	warner bros .  made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced ,  economical and very entertaining .  i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life .  this is one of warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work .  edward g .  robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences .  robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard .  h . b .  warner ,  aline macmahon and boris karloff are good ,  but the bad acting of frances starr and anthony bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie .  starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie .  in addition ,  the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code hollywood .  leroy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations .  sol polito's camera work is strong .  somehow ,  this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture  ( in a year that gave us  " m ,  "   " dracula "  and  " frankenstein "  )  .
-1	a little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification .  when it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other ,  it is assumed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter .  after this trauma ,  the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence .  all of this changes when one day ,  many years later ,  she receives a phone call from her daughter !  with the help of an ex-cop and a reporter ,  she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive .   " los sin nombre "  is a mess plot-wise ,  moves at an achingly slow pace ,  and is completely unscary .  the saving grace is emma vilarasau ,  who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother .  the best part of the movie is the ending ,  but i'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film .  beware of the english subtitles on the recent r1 release--they aren't very accurate .
-1	when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is !  edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but .  .  .   ( in a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience , done ,  a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action  , done ,  and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie .  .  .  )  when you see 30 elite police officers  ( packed with weapons that can demolish a building )  shoot at a guy behind a car ,  fail to hit him even once while he kills all  ( but 3 )  and then the guy takes out a flame thrower  ( to kill the rest 3 )   , you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this !
-1	i'm not alone in admiring the first superman movie ,  a film that richard donner executed masterfully .  i am also not alone in scorning richard lester's superman 2 .  .  .  which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie ,  sadly it is still an absolute abomination .   superman's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses ,  but superman 2 stretches things too far .  it doesn't matter who directed superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader .  in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do ,  unlike the original superman .  with or without his powers ,  superman's strength  ( or lack thereof )  is handled in the least believable manner .  there is too much to criticize ,  so i will not bother .  i condemn this movie .  .  .  perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on .  super-duper bad .
-1	i grew up on the 'superman ii' theatrical version  (  " s2t "  )  and as a kid ,  i loved it more than part i since not only did it contain more superman and three superman-type villains ,  it started off with a bang  the best clark kent to superman transformations and rescue scenes .  kids no longer had to impatiently wait for superman to appear on screen ,  as in part i .  now as an adult ,  i can see how the mighty had fallen with s2t  ( see :  my review .  )  i've always heard of the back-story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director ,  richard donner from part ii .   ( it must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously ,  now it's common :  'back to the future' and 'matrix' 2 & 3 for example .  )  unfortunately ,  after finally seeing the richard donner cut  ( or ,   " s2rd "  )  i still can't fully recommend it .  gone ,  was the great superman change scene ,  the entire paris rescue ,  as was the wonderful recap of part i in s2t's opening .  in fact ,  they all but wrote the words :   " previously on superman "  in s2rd .  the special effects weren't great in either part i or s2t  ,  but s2rd ,  they were mostly downright laughable  such as lois falling from the daily planet window .  i will admit ,  some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures ,  such as any scene in the  " honeymoon suite .  "  overall ,  if you grew up on s2t as i did ,  and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as i do as an adult ,  you should absolutely see s2rd as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes .   ( spoiler alert )  unfortunately ,  the worst change comes last :  gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from s2t replaced with the exact same ending as 'i . ' this is not only a lazy ,  unoriginal copout ,  it doesn't make sense on why clark would go back to that diner ,  if those events never actually happened .  and will he continue to  " turn back time "  for every confrontation ?
-1	so .  .  . we get so see added footage of brando .  .  . interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff .  susannah york was hardly a slouch .  new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets .  real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that .  .  . let's listen to donner make fun of lester's version that made more logical sense .  the president talks of the zod  " defacing "  the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore .  tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd .  superman's  " freedom of the press "  line sounded silly compared to  "  .  . care to step outside "  which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark's earlier scene in the truck stop .  then there is the ending with the  " turn back the world to go back in time "  effect .  it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack ,  n . j .  ever went since it doesn't free zod and company any more .
-1	superman ii - the richard donner cut should be a fan's dream come true .  at long last ,  footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life .  a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored .  it seems like a winning situation .  and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this  " esoteric dream "  is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence .  while it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project .  and it is only a very few times .   you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics .  but then we start seeing new footage  ( alternates from superman - the movie for the trial )  and that first bit of hesitation fades away .  hey ,  this is pretty neat !  things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project ,  and it doesn't convince at all .  and from this point on ,  it never ever lets up .  it's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects ,  but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was  " you'll believe a man can fly "  it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here .  the best effects in this are from the original productions .   another issue with this re-cut .  a lot of it just doesn't make sense .  the only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of superman ii ,  a movie that does make sense .  lester's superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly .  part of this could be because donner didn't get to complete shooting ,  the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible .  what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent .   after viewing this ,  one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material ,  michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester .  the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii .  that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence ,  not ironically ,  both were filmed by donner .  but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re-edited in such a hasty fashion ,  that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing .  while lester honored the donner material ,  lester here is thrown under the bus .   so is there anything good in this release ?  well marlon brando is in it ,  and that's neat to see .  in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman - the movie .  but that only highlights the problems of this release .  any of the major scenes  ( really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando )  would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section .  instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances  ( many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used )  sloppy edits and bad decisions .   watch the opening scene at the daily planet .  why are we looking at jackie cooper's back as he calls for lois and clark ?  at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on ?  i was initially confused by this ,  because i expected to see lois .  the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this .   battle scenes are a mess too ,  with no geography between cuts .  it's just random action .  of course ,  the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates .  they should have used more of lester's footage ,  but probably had too much pride to admit that .   the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well .  as noted elsewhere ,  the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation  " xk 10 "  while we all know it's the  " xk 101 "  !  a blind man in stm knows that !  the producers of this assembly ,  who tried so hard to honor the original film ,  dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production .  for all the supposed care that was put into this ,  the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable .   the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states .  as it is ,  we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a  " play all "  option .  it's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes ,  but after that initial viewing ,  i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else .  i know after my experience of watching this ,  i had new respect for lester's version .  it's by no means perfect ,  but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief .  he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so ,  while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history .
-1	i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was .  was the viewer supposed to learn something ,  or reflect on anything here ?  what was up with the pumpkins ?  was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots ?  does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel ?  why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews  ( it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery )  .  the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished .   i am truly amazed .  i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .
-1	i was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in north carolina .  instead i watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the duke family .  and this went on and on .  if mr .  mcelwee's family had prevailed over the dukes i doubt that mr .  mcelwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases .  i grew up near the area where mr .  mcelwee's family began it tobacco business  ;  i expected more than mcewee's continual focus on his family .  i learned very little about the history of tobacco in the nc economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco .  the countless references to the movie  " bright leaves "  are out of place - so what if gary cooper played mr .  mcelwee's great grandfather ?  does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the north carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film ?  i didn't .
-1	the author sets out on a  " journey of discovery "  of his  " roots "  in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the  ( completely and deservedly forgotten )  movie  " bright leaf "  is about an ancestor of his .  its not ,  and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie ,  suitable for screening at  ( the director's )  drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release .  a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring ,  irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his/her immediate circles .  avoid at all costs !
-1	'the curse of frankenstein' sticks faithfully to mary shelley's story for one word of the title ,  which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all .  the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with .  .  .  nothing .  the heart and moral centre of the story is gone .  it doesn't help that this frankenstein is a conniving ,  devious murderer ;  he deserves everything he gets .  the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichés .  even taken on its own terms ,  this is rubbish :  a bland ,  rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut .  as it's the first of hammer's horror films ,  directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee ,  its place in horror history is secure .  but it's crap .
-1	ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names .  i mean great actors like ,  the freeman aka morgan freeman ,  an asset to hollywood ,  however completely wasted in this film .  then we got kevin spacey ,  who i've been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects .  both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story .  then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake .  i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet .  well the reason for that  ,  i might add ,  is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review .  the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it .  the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone .  they got the one liners and sound-bite worthy stuff .  the token troubled black guy  ( ll cool j )  who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life .  the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone .  and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience .  oh and lots of gun fire ,  i mean a whole lot .  spoiler ( not !  !  !  )  the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails .  they got flame throwers and rocket launchers ,  really no kidding .   bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors ,  or a great fan of justin timberlake ,  to all the 13 year old girls out there ,  enjoy !  !  i wish i had more hands ,  because then i would have more thumbs ,  because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening .   may g*d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies .  well it could be worst ,  another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher ,  hehe check out in the mix lol ,  or even get rich or die trying' .  now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30+ year old men ,  playing 16 or even younger teens .  i could go on with these .
-1	nintendo !  !  !  you #%$@ers !  !  !  how could you do this to me ?  i can't believe it .  .  . this movie is actually worse than the first one .  i went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along .  .  .  . oh god .  .  . where do i even begin ?  the plot sucked .  the voice acting sucked .  the animation sucked .  the ending really sucked .  if you liked this movie ,  you suck too .  and to futuramafan1987 ,  who said this was the greatest movie ever ,  you are a tool ,  plain and simple .  this isn't a movie for anyone but crack-addled ten-year olds with game boys who think pikachu is god .  i'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie .  .  .  . and then there was pikachu's adventure .  .  . don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film .  it is ,  in all truth ,  one of the most boring experiences of my entire life .  don't go watch this at any costs .   bottom line :  go out ,  find every copy of this movie that you can ,  and burn it .  burn them all ,  and then proceed to rent a good movie ,  like aliens .  .  . or bowling for columbine .  .  . or even back to the future !
-1	now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have .  wow some demented pokémon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this .  animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pokémon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film .  it is just an animation it should be on video .   ps :  i'll give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there's no halves .
-1	pokemon the movie was a terrible film .  unlike the first one ,  this is not a good film at all .  the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it .  in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent .  the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad .  tracey really doesn't have much to say or do ,  and unlike brock offers no comic relief .  the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash ,  and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining .  overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife .  and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans . oh well ,  maybe the next one will be better . cant ge t much worse
-1	much worse than the original .  it was actually *painful* to sit through ,  and it barely held my six year old's interest .   introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting ,  but storyline is extra-thin ,  dialogue is still bad ,  and music is mediocre .  watch the television show instead - it's much better .
-1	i recently watched this again and there's another version which is shorter 1999 .  i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference .   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with .  ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice ?  ?    prof ivy was rather boring .  she sounded as if she was almost asleep ,  no expression at all with the few lines she had .   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn't much to it at all .    a collector  ( whos after lugia ,  he has no plan to destroy the world )  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction .   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better ,  deoxys  ( poke 7 )  is great ,  with no .  8 almost here .
-1	i figured that it's about time i let this one out .  pokémon fans are suffering in america these days .  why ?  because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies .  as far as the series goes ,  they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television .  so what is their problem when it comes to the movies ?  honestly now ,  i have seen all three pokémon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one .  they are excellent movies .  they are all enjoyable and fun to watch .  and ,  after seeing pokémon 2000 in theaters ,  i can't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts .  the way it appears ,  it seems that they read and see something that says `insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters .  it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb  ( extreme sarcasm there )  and created this crap .   *possible spoilers from here on*  well ,  i guess i should first talk about pikachu's rescue adventure .  my first gripe with this came with no narration .  i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokédex narration that plagued pikachu's vacation ,  and ,  instead of going with a caring ,  gentle woman's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai ,  they just cut the narration all together .  this wouldn't have been a problem ,  except for one thing .  did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didn't let togepi go until the end ?  possibly the fans ,  but i'm sure not the parents .  then ,  there's the theme song .  i couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one .  the japanese theme song was `tankentai wo tsukurou' and was sung by japanese children .  it was fun and enjoyable .  this one :  nauseating .  now ,  one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana .  nice music ,  fun to watch .  that's changed with the bellossom .  the music sucked for one ,  but on top of that ,  they had all the pokémon talk during the music ,  which turned out to be jumpy ,  annoying ,  and just unnecessary .  oh ,  and then there's the poliwhirl who thinks he's a poliwrath .  you'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are .  basically ,  not much could save this little ill fated dub ,  which is very unfortunate considering its potential .  but ,  i haven't touched on the worst of it yet .   you'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power .  for some unfathomable reason ,  i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb .  my thoughts were `well ,  they screwed up on the first movie ,  but the second is different as far as the theme goes ,  so they should do well . ' that in mind ,  i just didn't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said ,  `you will believe that one person can make all the difference . ' with the way they said that at every turn ,  i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version .  then comes nintendo power ,  in which i see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'the power of one . ' at that point ,  i became a bit more uneasy .  `the power of one ?  ! ' not a good sign .  however ,  i still kept some of my false faith .  big mistake .   sitting in the theater ,  i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk .  i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle .  i can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing ,  repeating it over and over like in msb .  however ,  it did more damage than anything else in this movie .  first of all ,  the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to ash . ' ah hah .  so ,  ash is the chosen one ?  whatever .  in the japanese version ,  the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony .  this time ,  he's the chosen one .  a greater way that this did damage was to lugia .  lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokémon movie .  .  .  .  when the movie was about lugia .  in this one ,  lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash .  in the scene where they're flying back to the main island ,  lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia's existence ,  not that ash is going to make all the difference .  overall in this category ,  ash wasn't really the `one person' that would make the difference ,  since he was helped by many along the way .   a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking .  furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one .  jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a mew card ? ' ugh .  even worse ,  misty's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held .  `why didn't you put them in pokéballs when you caught them ?  this is like caging them to be displayed . ' much different from whining about him thinking pokémon are things to be collected like stamps .  if there were any real redeeming values in this ,  they came from team rocket .  some pretty funny lines .  not really to make me laugh out loud ,  but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach .  well ,  that was officially the last american pokémon movie i'm going to see .  i've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable .  i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two .  i'll be importing the fourth one as well .  forget you ,  kids wb and 4kids .  you have forsaken me for the last time .
-1	a cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief's daughter ,  leading to much hate and violence .   this crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at ,  though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level .  the terrible costumes and the fact that all the indians are obviously white ,  makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press materials pretends it to be .   in short ,  the plentiful nudity  ( the real reason for watching this )  is good .  everything else is not .  there's definitely better examples of both genres .   more interesting is that the ramrodder was filmed at the infamous spahn movie ranch and features not one ,  but two members of the manson family ,  catherine share and bobby beausoleil ,  who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screens of the pussycat theater !
-1	this is an awful film .  yea the girls are pretty but its not very good .  the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way .  well ,  okay it might be interesting ,  but its not ,  because its so badly paced and and only partly acted .  i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen ,  probably more laughable then they do on tv .   ( i won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest .  never read about that in the old west )  this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward .   i like schlock films but this is ridiculous .  there is a reason that i don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good ,  the plot taking a back seat to breasts .  the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats .  the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent .  the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level ,  infantile but harmlessly fun .  something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie .   the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film .   i need not watch this again .   of interest to probably no one ,  the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil ,  a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped .   obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives .

-1	i saw this film at its premier at sundance 09 .   since american beauty is a movie that had something to say ,  i had hopes for towelhead .  unfortunately ,  it was a disappointment .  in fact ,  of countless movies i've seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals ,  towelhead is the only sundance movie i've ever wanted to walk out early from .   the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of  " provocative "  concepts concerning cultural stereotypes ,  rather than with an organic human drama .  the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian .  the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind :  i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views .  that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic .  if there ever was a time when towelhead's white male villains ,  condescending portrayals of blacks ,  ironic treatments of foreign cultures ,  etc .  ,  were fresh ,  it's long past .   for a more detailed review ,  please look up any of the many professional reviews available online .  almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on .   on the other hand ,  the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled .  as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites ,  you'll frequently come across superlatives :   " stunning ,  "   " breathtaking ,  "   " profound ,  "   " shocking ,  "   .  .  .  it embarrasses me to read them ,  but it does not surprise me .  indeed ,  i've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial ,  cultural ,  gender ,  or sexual issues as deeply moving ,  thought provoking ,  full of profound insight .  if you are such a person ,  by all means ,  rent towelhead and be moved by it .  on the other hand ,  if you set your standards higher ,  you can safely pass on this one .
-1	i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film .  i managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead  ( which ,  by the way ,  is great fun )  .   the story has massive holes in it .  the plot line is hugely over stated and dull ,  the acting is awful ,  especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at  ( looking daft and singing like a castrato )  .  morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable ,  especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet .  freeman and timberlake's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father/son relationship of sorts or something ,  which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that ;  though freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake ,  he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up .   it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line ,  which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion .   don't watch this film ,  it is a pure waste of time .
-1	unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie .  my points ;   film is based on 2 things ;   1 )  ethnical point of view :  as it happens on most of the american films ,  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture .  but unfortunately it is not enough .  knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture .  for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that .  lebanese people are christian  ( ok they got that )  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries .  the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism .  so we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film .    2 )  sexual revolution of a girl :  there is nothing much to say about this .  show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong .   i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre .  please watch dr . strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor .  a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it .  where is the truth ?  where is the meaning about the movie .
-1	hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits .  for every  " godfather ii ,  "  there are dozens of  " more american graffiti's ,  "   " stayin' alives ,  "  and  " grease 2's .  "  while the original  " grease "  is not a great film ,  the 1977 adaptation of the long-running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960's ,  energetic choreography ,  and an appealing cast .  when paramount began work on a follow-up ,  the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster .   fortunately for moviegoers ,  michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts .  her talent and beauty were already evident herein ,  and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform .  maxwell caulfield ,  however ,  lacks even the skill to express embarrassment ,  and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic .  what romantic interest ,  beyond hormones ,  could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield ?  that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory .  only cameos by veterans such as eve arden ,  connie stevens ,  and sid caesar have any wit ,  although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material .   reviewers have complained that ,  because  " grease 2 "  is always compared to the original ,  the movie comes up lacking .  however ,  even taken on its own terms ,  the film is a clunker .  after a frenetic opening number ,  which evidently exhausted the entire cast ,  the energy dissipates .  with few exceptions ,  the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's ,  and the only nostalgia evoked is for  " our miss brooks "  and  " sid caesar's comedy hour .  "  the jokes fall flat ,  and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite .  however ,  worse films have been inflicted on audiences ,  and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters .  unfortunately ,   " grease 2 "  is not even unintentionally funny .  instead ,  the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck .  just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered ,  the next scene plunges into even worse carnage .
-1	the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens ,  this one is a very bad copy .  the change is only in the sex .  in the first one the good one was sandy ,  here it's michael .  i prefer to watch the first grease .
-1	i'm sorry ,  but even tj hooker's adrian zmed couldn't save this sequel .  i went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original .  then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene  ( notice that this is the only movie that patricia birch directs )  ;  and i sadly realized they were trying to be serious .  i did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang ,  having lost their  " wheels "  due to their gambling habits in the original grease ,  were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie .  being shamed by that putz character carrington ,  i'd hate to see what they would resort to later :  maybe mopeds ?   i also never bought the hackneyed theme :  hunky-australian-boy-can't-fit-into-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look .  it was disney story gone horribly awry .   so ,  it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking michelle pfeiffer in a musical .  the only thing i took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it .
-1	the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student .  although in the previous film olivia newton st .  john's foreign speech pattern is not explained ,  it's explained here caulfield is her cousin .  what's conn still doing in school ,  i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she's a beautician .   caulfield's a smart kid ,  so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd .  and that's especially bad when zmed's girl friend decides she likes caulfield .  but being a nerd just isn't going to cut it .   that's when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act .  he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride .  he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face .  if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards ,  caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted .   grease 2 introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed .  if you saw the first grease film ,  a much better film ,  than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out .   in addition to conn ,  eve arden ,  sid caesar ,  and dody goodman ,  all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles .  the music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original .   it's not that grease 2 is bad ,  it's just not all that great .
-1	well ,  at least my theater group did ,  lol .  so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl ,  while it was never my favorite musical or story ,  it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch .  i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that's why i decided to never watch it ,  but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed ,  so i decided to give it a shot ,  but i called them up and just laughed .  first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever ,  not to mention they just used the same characters ,  but with different names and actors .  tell me ,  how did the pink ladies and t-birds continue years on after the former gangs left ?  not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy ,  gee ,  what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t-birds were just stupid and ridiculous .   another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped .  but when a new student who is sandy's cousin comes into the scene ,  he is love struck by a pink lady ,  stephanie .  but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t-birds ,  so the new student ,  decides to train as a t-bird to win her heart .  so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t-bird's butts .  but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own ?  well ,  find out for yourself .   grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn't work .  the gang didn't click as well as the first grease did ,  not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable ,  because i thought that she graduated from rydell ,  but apparently she didn't .  the songs were not really that catchy ;  i'm glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast ,  but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel ,  i wouldn't really recommend this film ,  other than if you are curious ,  but i warned you ,  this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical .   2/10
-1	boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs ,  only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow .  movie-buffs out there actually like this movie ?  it has fans ?  i must say ,  the mind reels .  .  .   " grease 2 "  is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage ,  moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames  ( like  " jaws 2 "  or  " exorcist ii "  )  .  no ,  it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead .  it looks and feels cheap ,  with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling .  this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and ,  although she doesn't embarrass herself ,  it's a role worth forgetting .  a misfire on the lowest of levels .  no stars from ****
-1	when i was 11 ,  grease 2 was like crack .  it was a classless ,  shameful ,  euphoric ,  and powerfully addictive experience .  my sister and i would watch it ,  rewind it ,  and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another .  so ,  if you are an 11-year old girl ,  and you reviewed this film as  " brilliant "  or  " fun "  or  " better than the original grease ,  "  you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass .   if ,  however ,  you are not a little girl ,  you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane ,  artless ,  slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production ,  distribution ,  and/or consumption .   for the sake of criticism ,  i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows   1 .  in a well-executed musical ,  the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters .  in grease 2 ,  with a few debatable exceptions ,  to the music is obscenely pointless .  most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way  (  " score tonight ,  "   " reproduction ,  "   " do it for our country ,  "  and  " prowlin' "  )  without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes .  plus ,  all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance .   2 .  the t-birds should be badass ,  and if not at least somewhat likable ,  but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser .  in the end ,  when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang ,  michael should kick it to the ground ,  spit on it ,  and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it .  but of course ,  he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads ,  there is no greater honor than to be one with the t-birds .    3 .  since michael is beautiful ,  smart ,  kind ,  resourceful ,  and above average in everyway  ( his musical impotence notwithstanding )  ,  it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask .  stephanie ,  on the other hand ,  is a slovenly ,  slack-jawed ,  bubble gum smacking ,  dirty sweatshirt wearing ,  gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat .  so aside from being pretty  ( i guess )  ,  she harbors no likable characteristics ,  thus ,  audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael's attraction to her .   i could go on and on ,  but i didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair .  i will say this though ,  to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake :  grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss .  only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces .  the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed .  trust me .
-1	i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love .  it's not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime .  everything's pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so ,  as a viewer ,  i wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline .  i guess i'm not the target audience for this but i'm not sure who is .  everything's muted and soft focus and earth tones .  .  . nothing's very interesting .  i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it's handled so discreetly that i was disappointed .  rent personal best instead .
-1	i've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained .  this movie is nothing .  it's so badly written ,  directed and acted that it barely makes an impression .  the characters speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible .  while that might make this campy and fun ,  it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull .  it's as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or didn't have the cojones .  this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie .
-1	the plot of 'edison' was decent ,  but one actor in particular ruined the entire film .  justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie .  he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen ,  and should face the same fate as the entire f . r . a . t .  squad .    whether it was an emotional scene ,  an action scene ,  or even a silent scene ,  justin timberlake managed to ruin it .    do not waste your time watching this film .  don't even bother downloading it ,  midget porn would be a much better choice .   and justin ,  if you're reading this ,  stick to music .  even though you're no good at that ,  you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .
-1	i laughed all the way through this rotten movie .  it's so unbelievable .  a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage ,  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office .  what happens ?  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job !  !  !  hilarious !  next thing you know the two women are going at it .  yep ,  they're lesbians !  nothing rings true in this  " lifetime for women with nothing better to do "  movie .  clunky dialogue like  " i don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn't take it "  doesn't help .  there's a wealthy ,  distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship .  a sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 ,  a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid .  hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave .  the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids .  sheesh !  no cliche is left unturned .
-1	they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love .  the only thing worse is the film itself .  the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital .  at one point when the wife leaves the husband ,  a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack !  no kidding .  the actors try but are defeated by the inept ,  unbelievably terrible script .  direction is staggeringly bad .  no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation .  how do things like this get made .  i'm turning off the television before it's over !
-1	this movie was okay ,  but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are  " born that way ,  "  especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman .  it almost seems as if kate's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch ,  making this film seem a little simplistic .   also ,  as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda ,  it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as  " bigots .  "  and there was no happy medium .  it was either kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her .  this is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends .  it is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play .  it is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make .  sadly ,  the movie showed none of these types of interactions .  for a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance ,  it struck me as very intolerant movie !  then at the end ,  kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what being gay is really all about ?  come on !
-1	why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles ?   " an unexpected love "  - ooh ,  how provocative !  !   " this much i know "  would have been better .  the film is nothing special .  real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed .  the straight woman who  " turns "  lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character .  if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion ,  you might enjoy this .  although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people .  why am i wasting my time writing about it ?
-1	i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager .  but i wanted to see it again ,  because traci lords is now earning a living as a  " serious actor "  .  what the hell was going on in the eighties ?  this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors .  definitely a waste of money .
-1	this is probably the first entry in the  " lance o'leary/nurse keat "  detective series ;  in subsequent o'leary films ,  he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee .   a group of relatives  ( all played by well-known character actors )  gathers in an old house  ( on a rainy nite ,  of course !  )  to speak to a wealthy relative ,  who goes into a coma .   while they wait for him to recover ,  all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen ,  including a couple of murders .   a creepy film ;  worth seeing !
-1	i am an actor , producer ,  director and what i am about to say are facts .  this project was the worst film in movie making history .  from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke .  why would blockbuster released such crap ?  i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession .  was the director trying to make a bad movie ?  i don't think so .  i seen bad zombie movies ,  but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table .  this movie sucks !  !  !  i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself ,  but please consider in taking up a different profession .  i respect the fact that you completed a movie ,  but i have to ask you  "  were you smoking crack  "  ,  i mean the makeup on your girls ,  the scary zombies ,  what were you thinking .  to the whole nation ,  if i could have voted zero i would have .  worst film in movie making history !  !  !
-1	german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible :  he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium .  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew .  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto ,  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set .  the answer is :  subterranean ;  lommel dug a pit and buried it .   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies .  only someone who has lived in los angeles ,  where every auto mechanic ,  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered ,  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .   the main character ,  a villainous beat cop ,  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent .  aside from being a serial killer ,  he is also the oldest beat cop in la .  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody ,  then drags them into his home  ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse )  ,  and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners ,  the lapd refuses to investigate ,  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .   the sets are excruciatingly bad .  the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ;  enough to paint  " precinct 707 "  on a cardboard wall .   since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of european emigres  ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands )  ,  bimbos ,  mimbos ,  and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets ,  special efx ,  locations or other production value ,  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms .  sadly ,  they couldn't afford a police car ;  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him .  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies .  the other fits right in ,  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie ,  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her .  don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered ,  just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride .   after much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves ,  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance .  they look exactly as they did before death ,  maybe even prettier ,  with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes .  looking nothing like zombies ,  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll ,  and injects large doses of cheesy euro-trash techno into the soundtrack .  we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise .  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .   unlike other zombies ,  lommel's girls speak and function as normal .  .  .  er ,  i mean ,  as they did before becoming zombified .  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog .  yes ,  a golden shower it is .   i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending .  all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece .  the spirit of ed wood lives on .  .  .  or should i say his geist .
-1	this movie is a joke .  i mean a  " ha ha "  funny joke .  why ?  because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical ,  inane plot and horrible acting .  wow !   within this movie there are so many unanswered questions .  .  .  for example ;  why do these women become zombies and how ?  why are there four black women who are zombie's  " caretakers "  and what is their purpose ?  since when does 6 people make up a  " nation "  of zombies ?  and is smeared black eye mascara  " scary "  to anyone ,  anywhere ?  even a 2 year old ?   and lastly ;  why was this movie made at all ?  why ?  why ?  why ?  no answer ?  that's what i thought .   on the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie :  we apologize for this movie in advance "  lol .  at least they had the decency to do this much !
-1	i cannot believe that this movie was ever created .  i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse .  the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup .  the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes .  finally ,  there are maybe five or six zombies total ,  definitely not a nation .  the best part of the movie ,  if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished .  again to reiterate other user comments ,  the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie .  also ,  there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all .  it is never explained .
-1	seriously crappy movie .   first off ,  the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse/furniture store .  the  " bad "  cop takes a girl ,  which they had pulled over ,  into the warehouse's attic ,  while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there .  the  " bad "  cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag ,  and the newbie cop doesn't think there are any problems ,  but he still wonders what was in the bag ,  so he asks ,  gets a bullshit response ,  and then he thinks everything is ok  ( for now )  .   the  " bad "  cop repeats this process ,  and even once with a tit scene  ( made it slightly better )  .  but eventually people start to catch on ,  which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was .  one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies ,  like ya do .  now ,  the  " bad "  cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch ,  and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged body .   since she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her ,  she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on ,  which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie .  .  .  also ,  the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become  " eye-shadow monsters "  .  some of the girls meet up with a dude ,  who is apparently a currency specialist ,  and he offers them a ride  ( they look normal to him apparently )  .  but when the girls see other people ,  such as the one girls husband ,  he freaks out because she is hideous  ( some people freak out ,  but others don't even notice )  .  .  .  .  massive plot hole .   so ,  to wrap it up ,  the eye-shadow monsters kill the  " bad "  cop ,  who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene .  it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel !  like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping .
-1	i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie .  it was so bad .  i was totally fooled by the box art .  don't be fooled !  !  its not worth your time i promise you .  i don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what .  i am so disappointed .   :  (    the description on the back of the box doesn't even match !  the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper .  the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 .  did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it !  ?  those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be .  if anyone actually liked this flick then i've lost all faith in humanity .   and don't even get me started on the story compared to the title .  or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations .  or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms .  why would i even say that ?  ?  who cares about the cops uniforms !  ?  compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on .    this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans .
-1	mt little sister and i are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs .  we have seen just about everything ,  especially zombie flicks .  now ,  we have seen a lot of good zombie movies ,  and a lot of bad ones .  this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .  not only was the acting horrible ,  but the special effects ,  graphics and ever  " zombie "  make-up was the worst i have seen .  if you can even call it make-up  (  black eye shadow around the eyes )  this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover .  cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about .  do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying  " this movie sucks ,  don't waste your time ,  return now "  hahahhaa i don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie !  i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did ,  t should be in the negative
-1	*** review may contain some spoilers *** i'll make this review short and sweet .  i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman .  how bad could it be ,  right ?  well ,  it's pretty bad .  justin timberlake plays pollack ,  a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison's police force .  ll cool j is deed ,  a cop within the force on a special force team called f . r . a . t .   ( first response assault tactics )  .  he's teamed with an  " on-the-edge "  bad cop named lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott )  .  in the opening scene we see lazerov & deed taking on some bank robbers ,  but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs .  i don't want to give to much away ,  but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs .  pollack ,  who works for ashford  ( morgan freeman )  goes to a trial involving deeds & lazerov .  he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford ,  does some investigate that turns ugly .  wallace  ( kevin spacey )  who is all within the f . r . a . t .  team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice .   you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey's performance are pretty lackluster .  the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott .  he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me .  ll cool j is terrible in this film .  he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion .  he was much better in movies like deep blue sea & any given sunday .  the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film .  the ending is far from satisfying .   don't waste your time with this film .  i'm putting it on ebay this weekend .
-1	someone actually gave this movie 2 stars .  there's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary .   this film is  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  i guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits  ( apart from the acting ,  plot ,  story ,  sets ,  dialogue and sound )  .  i wrongly assumed it was about zombies .    watching it is actually quite scary in fairness ;  you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home-made amateur torture videos or something along those lines .    i'm so taken aback i'm writing this review on my mobile so i don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1 . 6 to save others from the same horrible fate that i just suffered .    i worst film i've ever seen and i can say  ( with hand on heart )  it will never ,  never be topped .
-1	this film has to be the worst i have ever seen .  the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope .  the story line of the film is laughable at best ,  with the acting so poor you just have to cringe .  the title 'zombie nation' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total .  this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies 'attack' .  the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video .  if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so ,  then burn the copy .
-1	i stopped by bb and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend .  now ,  i understand that the effects will be cheesy ,  the acting will be sub-par ,  and the sets will be suspect .  so i'm not expecting much .  but it should at least have a story .  stories don't cost a thing except time .  .  .  .  . apparently ,  they didn't have any time either .    " zombie nation "  had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers .  the picture of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie .  it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre .   the running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours .  according to my wife  ( who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room )  ,  it sounded like zombie porn .  .  .  . which if you think about ,  sounds kinda gross .  .  .  .  . but it wasn't even that good .   the only suggestion i can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess .   it ended up being a free rental and i still feel ripped off .  i rated it a 1 out of 10 because imdb won't allow me to use decimals .
-1	not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts .   *makeup that a child can do .  *acting was over done .  .  . poor directing .  *editing was very choppy .  .  . many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous .  *sound was badly dubbed .  *music was highly inappropriate .  *casting was extremely off .  .  . must have been on crack .  *zombies that talk let alone .  .  . drive ,  dance ,  work .  .  . just pisses me off .  *and the bad guy .  .  . holy crap !  as horribly casted as he was .  .  . he was the best looking zombie of all .  which doesn't say much .   the cover art was good but very deceiving .  .  . as was the main menu of the dvd .  .  . great artwork and music .   don " t bother !
-1	thank god !  i didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it !  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life ,  f*****g visual effects ,  unnecessary gore and nudity !  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others .  there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie .  ok if you get time after reading this comment ,  please check out the director's ( ulli lommel )  profile .  after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this ,  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2 .  and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him ,  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence .  even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie .
-1	usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant .  .  . i tend to support everybody ,  because their efforts are worth .  .  .   but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits !   imagine the following situation :   1 .  think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far .   2 .  think about some great ,  attractive art for that movie's dvd box .  .  . and a promising plot .  .  .   3 .  voilà !  you got zombie nation .   see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do .  anything is better .
-1	notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero .  as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest .  i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake .  but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen .   the box makes this movie out to look well ok at best .  do not let that fool you .  this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world .   the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it .  the acting  ( if you can call it that )  ,  the  " plot "   ( so many holes must look like swiss cheese )  ,  and the special effects really are just terrible .   please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch .   in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this ,  but i am thinking it .
-1	if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap .  i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity .  i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so insultingly poor ,  i can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable .   there's no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking .  the people don't react ,  act or in any way resemble human beings .  the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be .  the whole thing is one pointless mess ,  it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much .   i could make a better film than this ,  so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before .  it's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time .   honestly ,  the very worst movie of all time .  you'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to buy the dvd .  i can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film ,  it's terrible .   0/10 and that's generous .
-1	this movie had me going .  the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard .  i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors ,  band together ,  and plan to take out the zombies .  dead wrong !  it's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge .  as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved .  where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation .   first off ,  the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face .  what are zombies but mindless ,  debatable intelligent ,  cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs ?  these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models ,  they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies .  sure the eating and killing is there ,  but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement ?  although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre ,  it makes fun of that genre and asks the question ,   " why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines ?  "  i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies .  i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much ,  it's an insult and as for scarynot even .
-1	i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap .  the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie .  no ,  it was a hundred times worse .  ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true ;  the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever .   the american cop has a german accent !  the  " police station "  was a desk in a warehouse with a sign  " police station "  hanging on the wall .  there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet .   this cop pulls women over ,  cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse .  he tells his cop partner to wait in the car .  then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag .  the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right ,  that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women ,  but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because - he's a moron !  the dialog is totally stupid ,  the acting is awful ,  and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen .  it is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it ,  and yet ,  the partner ,  who is there all along ,  doesn't know what is happening !    the director of this film is a total hack .  i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn't take it anymore .  it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won't waste anymore time on it writing this review .    absolutely worthless .
-1	i rented this movie last week .  i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it ,  so it seemed promising .  and it was ,  until justin timberlake came on scene .  he is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again .  i mean ,  he is one of the most boring ,  uninspired actors i've ever seen .  he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever .  why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack ?  i think matt damon would have been a better choice .   kevin spacey was another big disappointment .  his character is so dull ,  it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en .  it might sound cool ,  but believe me ,  it's not .   now ,  dylan mcdermott's acting is very good .  it's about one of the very few good things about this movie .  he is just inspired .   morgan freeman is good but nothing special .  he has some really cool lines though .   about the story ,  although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good .  i was expecting a big twist when lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott )  was killed ,  but nothing really happened .
-1	zombie nation 2004 r  hey ,  i was bored .  i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch .  zombie nation ?  hey ,  i love zombie movies .  says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description .  funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film .  i could've used that advice .   zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed .  it has little  ( if anything ,  depending on your point of view )  to do with zombies ,  and takes place all within one city .  this film revolves around a crooked cop ,  who acts as badly as possible  ( he has to be trying to suck this much )  ,  while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them .  yup ,  he's a serial killer cop .  not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick ,  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong .  serial killers enjoy killing ,  they live for it and they get down and personal with it .  this guy knocks out the women ,  and injects them with some poison .  he doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it .  talk about boring !  eventually ,  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason ,  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy .  they were all buried or tossed into the ocean ,  but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing .  the women then act very poorly and take their revenge .  oh yay .   this film was crap in every category .  crap acting ,  crap writing ,  crappier sets ,  and crappier make-up effects .  the women don't look zombie-like ,  unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie .  they can all talk ,  behave ,  think ,  and act perfectly human .  the gore is weak compared to even many pg-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief .  you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence .  .  .  then the exact same breasts later !  go figure .  guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite .  the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in .  you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set-up and even ,  unless you are blind ,  you can see the director failing .  steer clear ,  it's a waste of time .   1/10
-1	yeah ,  i'm sure it really could be a nation  .   .   .  if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times .  man ,  i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear . net instead of renting it .  i'm a big fan of the george romero movies and i'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie ,  he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard .  i mean ,  what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie's devils ?  it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer ,  especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop/police station/apartment/flat/whatever room it was with the gong in the background ,  and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop .  i couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was ,  and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either .  oh well ,  what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world .  so ,  for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad c movies  ( c for craptastic )  ,  then this is the movie for you  .   .   .  or not .
-1	last weekend i bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of  " land of the dead "  .   boy ,  was i wrong .    it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art ,  which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre .   we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone .  they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him ;  but once they started driving the car ,  i couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore .   some people actually consider this a  " so bad ,  it's good "  movie ,  they are liars .  i didn't finish the movie ,  but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie ,  which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through .   this is even worse than  " zombiez "  do not watch !
-1	german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible :  he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made .   lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium .  this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew .  i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto ,  morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set .  the answer is :  subterranean ;  lommel dug a pit and buried it .   the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies .  only someone who has lived in los angeles ,  where every auto mechanic ,  doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered ,  could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face .   the main character ,  a villainous beat cop ,  is played by a german actor with a thick german accent .  aside from being a serial killer ,  he is also the oldest beat cop in la .  despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody ,  then drags them into his home  ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse )  ,  and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners ,  the lapd refuses to investigate ,  going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment .   the sets are excruciatingly bad .  the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ;  enough to paint  " precinct 707 "  on a cardboard wall .   since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of european emigres  ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands )  ,  bimbos ,  mimbos ,  and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets ,  special efx ,  locations or other production value ,  it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms .  sadly ,  they couldn't afford a police car ;  the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental .   more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him .  one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies .  the other fits right in ,  with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated .   the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie ,  as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her .  don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered ,  just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride .   after much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves ,  the zombie girls manage to make their appearance .  they look exactly as they did before death ,  maybe even prettier ,  with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes .  looking nothing like zombies ,  they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway .   at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll ,  and injects large doses of cheesy euro-trash techno into the soundtrack .  we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise .  stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty .   unlike other zombies ,  lommel's girls speak and function as normal .  .  .  er ,  i mean ,  as they did before becoming zombified .  this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog .  yes ,  a golden shower it is .   i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending .  all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece .  the spirit of ed wood lives on .  .  .  or should i say his geist .
-1	btk killer ,  green river killer ,  zodiac killer ;  the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is ,  he loves his crap .   i've never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful .  like the movies i said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together !  after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is .  he is the worst out there .   the credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in .  the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots .  the editing is easily the worst .  this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and i was only 45 minutes in the movie .  i couldn't take it anymore .  i wasted 45 minutes of my life .   do not watch this crap !
-1	this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life .  i'm not even kidding .  it was poorly made and the actors couldn't act .  it was a waste of my time and money .  it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own .  the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise .  nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case .  it appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie .  the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie .  which watching the credits was the best part of the movie .  this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn't believe how badly it was put together .  scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like  " whats going on ?  "  the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene .   if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is .  i wish i would have watched it before i rented it .
-1	horrible acting ,  bad story line ,  cheesy makeup ,  and this is just the tip of the iceberg .  i have never seen a worse movie in my life ,  5 minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen .  .  .  it didn't .   ( aside from a nice breast shot )  the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse ,  and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets .  you even see this same red chair in several different  " locations "  if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment ,  not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog .  .   ( note to producers )  renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse ,  and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable )  if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee .  .  .  you will be demanding your money back .  .  .  i only spent $2 . 99 to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off .
-1	every year i watch hundreds of films ,  including many low budget amateurish straight-to-dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see .  i have seen thousands of films in my time ,  many excellent ,  many forgettable .  zombie nation i will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films i have ever seen  in fact i still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it .   the day after ,  it seems like some kind of weird dream .  did i really see what i thought i saw ?  why do the police work out of a warehouse ?  did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers ?  is it safe ?  is it safe ?  is it safe ?    i wouldn't recommend zombie nation if you want to see a 'good' film ,  and neither would i recommend it as 'so bad its good' .  however ,  if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever  this is for you .  now ,  whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is ,  i will say zombie nation .   seriously  i think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one ,  and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude .  he really is the ed wood jr .  of the digital age ,  and i for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one .
-1	ll cool j .  morgan freeman .  dylan mcdermott .  kevin spacey .  john heard .  cary elwes .  roslyn sanchez .  justin timberlake -- wait a minute .  justin timberlake ?  and he's the star ?  i should have known better than to rent edison force .  in fact ,  i did know better .  but in a moment of absolute weakness ,  i rented this stv .  when you have big names like freeman and spacey in an stv ,  you know it's one of two things :  an indie or a dog .  as in sat-on-a-shelf .  which this did .  and with good reason .  the plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la magnum force ,  and  " journalist "  timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them .  he is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe i should say for his horrible acting .  i turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing .  just awful .  the real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard ,  looking like nothing so much as a hobo .  you just know the director was not in control .  freeman is clearly slumming .
-1	i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging .  the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary .  then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on .  zero special effects .  .  . and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet .  the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie .  the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a  " cult classic "  .  .  . however ,  i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made .  the real horror in this film is how bad it is .  i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again !
-1	this is one of the worst films ever .  i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful .  where are the images in the film that are on the box ?  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .    why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading ?  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box .  as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store .  i have no one to blame except myself .  i want my money and time back .    do not watch this movie .    even if curiosity is motivating you ,  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead .  it will be much more enjoyable .  you have been warned !
-1	i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film .  i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising .   it's not enough that the movie itself is a p . o . s .  ,  but the cover art is what sold me .  i've done better make-up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art .  can you say  " raccoon eyes ?  "   i'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details ,  but come on ,  the movie's main character is an l . a .  cop who was born and raised in alabama - but has a german accent !  ?  !  it's beyond insulting .
-1	i honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back .   the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better .   then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes .   they talked like regular people .   one drove a car .   some voodoo woman asked what one of the  " zombies "  wanted and the  "  zombie "  said  (  i want to dance )    (  that was it )  out came the movie i couldn't take it any longer can i sue for a ½ hour of my life ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
-1	wow .  i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem .  i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood .  i brought it home and put it on .   this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind .  this was much worse .  i wanted a bad movie but what i got ,  i didn't know that crap like this existed amongst man .  this movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it .   i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies .  he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs .   if you are thinking about renting this or buying it .  i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide .   " don't do it ,  it's not worth it !  "  i really have nothing nice to say about this movie .  don't do it !
-1	acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas .  high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york's social set .  oh yes ,  don't forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder .  the all star cast features :  barbara stanwyck ,  van heflin ,  james mason ,  ava gardner ,  cyd charisse and nancy davis .
-1	the animation in this re-imagining of peter & the wolf is excellent ,  but at 29 minutes ,  the film is sleep inducing .  they should have called it  " peter & the snails "  ,  because everything moves at a snail's pace .  i couldn't even watch the film in one sitting - i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time ,  and it was pure torture .   save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me .   i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees .  unfortunately ,  to vote for the winner in the best animated short  ( short !  )  category ,  the voters will have to sit through the whole thing .  i already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning .
-1	amateur ,  no budget films can be surprisingly good  .  .  .  this however is not one of them .   ah ,  another brad sykes atrocity .  the acting is hideous ,  except for emmy smith who shows some promise .  the camera  " direction "  needs serious reworking .  and no more  " hold the camera and run "  gimmicks either ;  it just doesn't work .  the special effects are unimaginative ,  there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time .  if you're going to rip off an ear ,  please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood .  the scenery is bland and boring  ( same as mr .  sykes other ventures )  ,  and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal  ( see the scenery comment )  .   did i mention the lack of any real plot ,  or character development ?  apparently ,  the scriptwriter didn't .   whoever is funding this guy  .  .  .  please stop .  i've seen some of his other  " home movies "   ( which i will not plug )  and they are just as bad .  normally ,  a  " director "  will grow and learn from his previous efforts  .  .  .  not this guy .  it's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker ,  but anyone can be a hack .   definitely not even a popcorn film  .  .  .  of course ,  chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort .   award :  the worst ever military push-ups in a film .
-1	this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale .  a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy .  they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence .  however ,  after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence .  however ,  out of no where ,  when they are on a luxury cruise ,  the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life !  what an odd ,  silly and preachy film !  personally ,  i'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable !   the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .
-1	bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry  ( as fred and emily hill )  receive an advance on an inheritance .  they use the money go traveling .  their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann  ( for mr .  kendall )  and lonely percy marmont  ( for ms .  barry )  .  but ,  they remain as boring as they were before .  arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled  ( as quoted in the film ,  from shakespeare's  " the tempest "  )   " rich and strange "  by ordering up some camera trickery .  an opening homage to king vidor's  " the crowd "  is the highlight .  the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat .   *** rich and strange  ( 12/10/31 )  alfred hitchcock ~ henry kendall ,  joan barry ,  percy marmont ,  elsie randolph
-1	yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation .  as with juno and the paycock ,  you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie .  there is almost no style or craft to it at all .  the story revolves around fred and emily ,  a young married couple ,  who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage .  emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted ,  wealthy man who falls in love with her ,  but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband .  this might seem more believable if fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive ,  pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman .  the couple ends up staying together ,  but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene .  the third act goes in a completely different direction ,  with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat .  joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband .  that's about all you can say for this one .
-1	how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up ?  with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers ,  you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop .   you will never get your 90ish minutes back .  life is too precious to rent this movie .   i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie .   if you like justin timberlake ,  feel free to rent this movie .  he does have a very major part in it ,  so fans might enjoy seeing him .    however ,  i believe most of his fans are young girls ,  who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .
-1	i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together ,  the talk is not of the master's great films like  " north by northwest "  or  " strangers on a train "  ,  but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931 ,  obscure and seriously flawed ,  which showcases the great director in fledgling form .   emily and fred hill  ( joan barry and harry kendall )  are a middle-class london couple scrimping to stay ahead .  he begrudges their lot ;  she accepts it .  change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle ,  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury .  they make plans for a world cruise .  but their problems have only begun .   just ask richard hannay ,  roger o .  thornhill ,  or marion crane .  well ,  marion's indisposed at the moment ,  but you get the idea .  travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight ,  setting one up for a perilous journey at best .  this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme ,  and not his most successful or memorable .  hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element ,  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense ,  but the two do not cohere ,  at least not here .   the hills are a dull ,  flat couple ,  with no chemistry or personality .  when they find themselves at the folies bergère ,  in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film ,  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers .   " the curtain's gone up too soon !  "  gasps emily .   " they aren't dressed .  "   when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise ,  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing ,  even if the people they partner off with are drips ,  too .  emily's man ,  gordon  ( percy marmont )  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs ,  which he suggests be filled by emily .  fred's girl  " the princess "   ( betty amann )  has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five o'clock shadow .  there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger ,  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue .  subtlety was still to come .   everything is shot in an abrupt manner ,  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue .  hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off ,  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears .  when fred and emily break off ,  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged-together rickshaws ,  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism .   emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character ,  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon ,  but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes ,  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion .   matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with ,  and presumably repair their relationship .  only they aren't active participants in the resolution ,  and except for the fate of a friendly cat ,  nothing about the ending resonates .   at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s ,  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food .   " rich and strange "  is hitchcock paying his dues ,  and learning his trade ,  one for scholars but not casual film goers .
-1	there is no suspense in this serial !  when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy ,  the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day .  no ,  in fact ,  the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode !  this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made ,  let alone released on dvd !  obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films ,  but even the script is awful .  an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that ,  i am not quite sure ,  because it is too awful to follow .  watch the 60s version ,  or the 90's versions ,  or even batman begins ,  just anything over this version !
-1	.  .  . this would have been what you got .   words alone cannot describe how bad this is .  if you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes .   robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here .  in an interview ,  johnny  " duncan "  robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight !  duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape .   driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al's used car lot at below sticker price-- the dynamic duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's bruce wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial .   the acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i'm sure it read along the lines of  " batman says something here "  because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along .   batman's utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again .  his cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike .   in one scene  ( i am not making this up )  ,  batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods .  it's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained .  well ,  unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground .  thanks batman !   in another scene after the batmobile is disabled ,  batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one !  yes ,  you guessed it ,  said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds .  not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city .   there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman-- she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce's house-- or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood .   everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen .  if you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark-- if you want entertainment ,  try the burton batman films ,  the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial .
-1	granting the budget and time constraints of serial production ,  batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any  " cliffhanger "  list ,  utterly lacking the style ,  imagination ,  and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor ,  batman .   the producer ,  sam katzman ,  was known as  " king of the quickies "  and ,  like his director ,  spencer bennett ,  seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement .   ( unfortunately ,  this team also produced the two superman serials ,  starring kirk alyn ,  with their tacky flying animation ,  canned music ,  and dull supporting players .  )  the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come :  thoroughly inane titles  (  " robin rescues batman ,  "   " batman vs wizard "  )  ,  mechanical music droning on ,  and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around ,  either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks .  batman's cowl ,  with its devil's horns and eagle's beak ,  fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes .  his  " utility belt "  is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments ,  from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments !   in any case ,  the lead players are miscast .  robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne ,  and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman .  he creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere ,  anywhere else !  john duncan ,  as robin ,  has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue .  he is too old for the part ,  with an even older stuntman filling in for him .  out of costume ,  lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink ,  without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial .   although serials were not known for character development ,  the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast .  this one offers a group going through the motions ,  not that the filmmakers provide much support .  not one of the hoodlums stands out ,  and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever ,   " the wizard .  "   ( great name !  )  actually ,  they are led by someone sporting a curtain ,  a shawl ,  and a sack over his head ,  with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing .  the  " prime suspects "  -- an eccentric professor ,  a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying .   even the established comic book  " regulars "  are superfluous .  it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne .  despite the perils she faces ,  vicki displays virtually no emotion .  commissioner gordon is none-too-bright .  unlike in the previous serial ,  alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is  " mr wayne's residence .  "  they are props for a drawn-out ,  gimmick-laden ,  incoherent plot ,  further saddled with uninspired ,  repetitive music and amateurish production design .  the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom ,  the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel .  the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing .   ( the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet !  )   pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure .  while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious  " batfan ,  "  one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box .  they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined .   now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version !
-1	this show made me feel physically sick ,  and totally detached from british society as a whole .  it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there were/are no class divisions in britain .  they'd always say things like ;   " go into your loft and you may find this .  .  "  or  " go into your back garden tonight and .  .  .  "  - what about us 'scummy' working class kids who never never had a  " loft "  ,  and a  " back garden "  which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block ?  public service broadcasting - yeah right !  and on top of that ,  it was awfully depressing to see those stupid ,  middle class ,  up-their-own-backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having 'fun' .  .  .  do me a favour ,  and  " why don't you "  go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on  " mama and papa's "  money .  .  .  you make me sick
-1	he was my hero for all time until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} i went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors .  i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does .  when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .   the plot is unbelievable as a movie ,  and even if you excuse the visuals ,  and had read this story as a novel ,  you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation .  he shows no effort and no enthusiasm ,  and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all .   i hate to repeat other peoples comments ,  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic .  the condition of those scenes chopped in ,  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time .  the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie ,  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds .  i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget  ( segal being paid 5 of that )  and that the movie still came in under budget .  i must concur .   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie ,  as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie  .
-1	i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is .  i was sold on the promise of action ,  with segal and stealth aircraft ,  which normally make for an entertaining action movie .  i can honestly say i'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again .  the acting was so awful that it was almost funny .  the story was insanely weak ,  with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f117 through them .  the script was so poor ,  if i found out that a 10 year old wrote it i shouldn't be in the least surprised .  the direction and production is so amateur ,  i wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video .  utter utter drivel .  those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art ,  and they should be ashamed of themselves .  steven segal should never ever show his face in public again ,  i can't imagine what made him agree to star in this ,  the worst film i have seen in my entire life .
-1	i own almost every seagal movie  ( yes even ones like this that are low budget )  ,  and i must say ,  this may be the worst ,  not only of his movies ,  but of all movies ever made .  the only highlight of this film ,  and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 ,  is that a .  it is seagal ,  and b .  seagal does have some sweet action sequences ,  specifically in the store ,  and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife .  next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people ,  and don't even bother with a story line ,  because the storyline not only stunk ,  but so did the acting ,  the fact that f-18's and f-14's somehow changed into f-16s ,  and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f-16 .  also the stealth never had to refuel ?  ?  ?  and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point .  last i checked ,  afghanistan has no air force ,  we  ( usa )  control the skies .  also ,  this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room ,  yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret .  also ,  how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck ,  to the top ?  please tell us why they jailed him ,  since when are air force pilots great commandos  ( unless they are owen wilson ?  )  and since when are their drunks in arab countries ,  considering muslims don't drink alcohol ?  also on top of that ,  since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the #2 in charge ?  the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store ,  and the other 50 people he killed with a knife ,  as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .
-1	well ,  i can once and for all put an end to the question :  'what is the worst movie ever made .  .  . ever ? ' it is flight of fury ,  starring and co-written by steven seagal .  sure there are lots of famously bad movies ,  but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously .   it is a romanian-made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood .  it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become .  this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry ,  knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again .   it was released only on video  ( i can't imagine why )  and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .
-1	star rating :  ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning   the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other .  a renegade pilot  ( steve touissant )  steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it .  so they are forced to send in their best man john sands  ( seagal ,  who else ?  )  to stop him ,  in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years .   i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought .  but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man  ( by the same director )  wasn't bad and ,  what the hell ,  seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe ,  just maybe ,  he could make a great film again .  oh what a fool i was .   dubbing ,  horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets ,  awful camera work ,  cheap production values ,  risible ,  unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal's trademark and a boring ,  sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere .   thankfully his next film ,  once upon a time in the hood  ( which i'll be skipping )  ,  apparently marks the end of his contract with sony ,  meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres .  hell ,  he's done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him  ( rocky balboa .  )    this isn't a flight of fury .  it isn't even a flight of fun .  it's a flight that fails to even take off the ground .  *
-1	if you watched this movie you know why i said  " jesus ,  jesus ,  jesus "  .  hehehe !  !  !  every time they said  " jesus ,  jesus ,  jesus "  .  .  .  i laughed thinking  " jesus ,  jesus ,  jesus ,  why did i rent this movie "  ?  i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen .  wtf is timberlake ?  dreaful acting !  i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job !  this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him .  .  .  but i really prefer an actor ,  not this android called timberlake .  and his girlfriend was shallow ,  hollow and annoying as hell .  i was happy when they both were popped in the street .   the story was ok and i think dylan mc dermott did his bad guy role very well .  the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all .  it would have been much enjoyable without him .   by the way ,  the music was ok ,  but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes ,  low motion and things like that .  something misplaced for this cops movie i thought .  maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake .
-1	unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes .   the plot - even for a seagal film ,  the plot is just stupid .  i mean its not just bad ,  its barely coherent .   the acting - unbelievably wooden .  literally seen better acting in porno's .  ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene' which is utterly cringe-worthy .   special effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and sorcery flick .   unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures ,  don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd ,  as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .
-1	steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .   this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil english villain' that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days .   suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent .  the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story ,  characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to .   in short a terrible script with bad dialog ,  delivered by sub-par actors ,  boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes ,  and non-relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the movie even worse .   save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss ,  even if you are seagal's most ardent fan .
-1	i just watched this movie on starz .  let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ;  the acting ,  writing ,  directing ,  special effects ,  camera crew ,  sound ,  and lighting .  it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie .  apparently back in 2007 ,  when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million .  now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible .  apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour .  there was a completely random lesbian scene ,  which i didn't mind ,  but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it .  the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes .  oh yeah ,  since its a steven segal movie ,  its predictable as hell .  all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane .
-1	nobody could like this movie for its merit but ,  if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their mst3 quality ,  then this is for you .  it ranks up there with  " road house "  for its preposterous characters ,  sets and story line .  the bad writing really cracked me up :   " i want you to dust those guys off "  instead of  "  .   .   .  dust those guys .  "  f-14s take off from the carrier but ,  when they get into formation ,  they're f-16s !  without a hint of anger or skepticism ,  segal goes back to work for the general who ,  only minutes before ,  was overseeing a covert  " mind wipe "  on seagal .  segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards .  so naturally ,  the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too !  the hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway .  the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to afganistan without refueling .  then segal flies it back to california - the long way ,  i . e .  ,  by way of europe - even though there's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the arabian sea .  the cic in the carrier consists of 3 black pcs ,  2 flat screen tvs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls .  what a hoot !
-1	first of all ,  f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft .   secondly ,  the f14's and f18's cannot change their appearances ;  they are not transformers .    thirdly ,  the f16 has only one m61 cannon ,  not two .    last but not the least ,  at the end of the film ,  seagle selected sidewinder missile .  but somehow when he pulled the trigger ,  the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick .  as i have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's ,  this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me .  however ,  there is still one question i have to ask :  how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 .  .  .   when students hand in really bad work ,  teachers assign 0's .  now i think for the sake of properly marking this film ,  imdb should seriously consider adding a '0/10' option .  otherwise ,  it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 .  .  .
-1	over the years i've seen a bunch of these straight to video segal movies ,  and every one holds the same amount of entertainment ;  unfortanetley ,  the entertainment level is at a low .  sure ,  the action sequences were amusing ,  but that was pretty much it .  seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like ;  under siege ,  under siege 2 ,  and executive decision ( at least on the action standpoint )  ,  but during the past ten years ,  these types of movies that star segal really do not meet his past qualifications .   on the more positive side ,  the movie did make good use of time ,  like some of the action sequences and use of wit .  just when the movie seemed to just drag on ,  a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter .  i honestly believe that more of segal's movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie .  supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing ,  and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses ,  maybe the movie will get more popular results .
-1	you've gotta hand it to steven seagal :  whatever his other faults may be ,  he does have good taste in women .  if you pick a seagal movie ,  chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it .  and usually ,  they do not function as mere eye candy ;  they get involved in the action and fight ,  shoot guns ,  kill with knives ,  etc .   " flight of fury "  offers the duo of ciera payton  ( who has a very sexy face ,  with luscious lips to match angelina jolie's )  and katie jones ,  and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling !  and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them ,  it's because the rest of the movie ,  although passable ,  is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about .  ironically ,  the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself ,  who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care .  this being a military-type actioner ,  there is very little fighting in it ,  and he doesn't fit into his role  ( a stealth fighter pilot ,   " the best in the world "  ,  of course )  very well ,  which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .   ( *1/2 )
-1	this movie should have never been made .   what a shame of the budget .   please hire convincing actors ,  and make a proper movie .  very thin plot ,  and unconvincing lines .  almost hilarious ,  and that is a shame for an action movie .  .  .  .    definitely not worth watching .   they keep replaying the same  " shots "  of an stealth airplane flying away .  you have seen it ones ,  and that was not worth re-running 3 or 4 times .   it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie-making .   his movies are getting worser every time .   black dawn ,  and submerged were already bad ,  but this movie is even worse .
-1	steven seagal ,  mr .  personality himself ,  this time is the united states' greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military (  .  . who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base ,  later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station ) if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday ,  who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor .  along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor ,  jannick ( mark bazeley )  ,  john sands ( seagal ) will fly into enemy territory ,  receiving help from his arab lover ,  jessica ( ciera payton ) and a freedom fighter ,  rojar ( alki david )  once they are on ground .  jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders ,  stone ( vincenzo nicoli ) and his female enforcer ,  eliana ( katie jones )  ,  and sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter ,  but rescue him as well .  and ,  maybe ,  sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained ,  rather ( steve toussaint ) in the process .  sands has 72 hours until a general's navy pilots bomb the entire area .  on board the stealth ,  black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb ,  hoping to detonate it on the united states .   seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives .  the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead .  the setting of afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny (  .  . nor does how easily seagal and co .  are able to move about the area undetected so easily )  and the plot itself is nothing to write home about .  the movie is edited fast ,  the camera a bit too jerky .  seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes ,  unlike the good old days .  one of seagal's poorest efforts ,  and he's as understated as ever (  .  . not a compliment )  .  even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains ,  tis a shame .  he doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way (  .  . sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around ,  but it's not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups )  .
-1	flight of fury starts as general tom barnes  ( angus macinnes )  organises an unofficial test flight of the x-77 ,  a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible .  general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher  ( steve toussaint )  the job & everything goes well until the x-77 disappears ,  even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone  ( vincenzo nicoli )  who plans to use the x-77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people .  general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands  ( co-writer & executive producer steven seagal )  to get it back & kill all the bad guy's in the process .  .  .   this american ,  british & romanian co-production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man  ( 2006 )  & attack force  ( 2007 )  ,  luckily someone decided the partnership wasn't working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration's between the two .  apparently flight of fury is an almost scene-for-scene word-for-word remake of black thunder  ( 1988 )  starring michael dudikoff with many of the same character's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two .  flight of fury is a terrible film ,  the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days .  it's boring even though it's not that slow ,  the character's are poor ,  it's full of clichés ,  things happen at random ,  the plot is poor ,  the reasoning behind events are none existent & it's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed .  the action scenes are lame & there's no real excitement in it ,  the villains are boring as are the heroes & it's right down there with the worst seagal has made .   flight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isn't even matched up that well ,  the background can change ,  peoples clothes change ,  the area changes ,  the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as it's all too obvious we are watching clips from other  ( better )  films spliced in .  hell ,  seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this .  the action scenes consist of shoot-outs so badly edited it's hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms .  the whole production feels very cheap & shoddy .   the imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12 , 000 , 000 which i think is total rubbish ,  i mean if so where did all the money go ?  although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods ,  it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan .  the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed again .   flight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring ,  amateurish & is an almost scene-for-scene remake of another film anyway .  another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal ,  why do i even bother any more ?
-1	timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen .  it wasn't all bad ,  i just think the reporters role was wrong for him .   ll cool j played the typical rapper role ,  toughest , baddest guy around .  i don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie ,  not even when proposed to his girlfriend .   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie .  he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie .   kevin spacey wasn't good or bad he was just  " there "  .   overall it's a dull movie .  bad plot .  a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors .
-1	flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i've ever seen .  .  . up to now .   it's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest ,  seagal isn't really trying in this - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more .   the co-stars fare no better ,  being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters .   the direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers  ( shadow man & attack force )  the screenplay co-written by seagal himself is laughably inept .   according to imdb $12m was spent on this boring load of old tosh - if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent .   flight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder - which has to be better than this tripe .   this has no redeeming qualities whatsoever , give it a miss !  1/2 * out of *****
-1	as steven segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel .  his best was just fodder for bored teenagers .  this one tips the scales ,  then falls off .  the characters are all cardboard .  the story is double lame .  i can't spoil it by telling you the ending .  you already know how all steven segal movies end if you have seen one .  here goes .  he is a super-dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide ,  instead of killing him ,  to dope his brain until he don't remember squat .  he escapes ,  of course ,  gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in afghanastan by a rogue air force pilot who ,  surprise ,  surprise ,  segal trained .  all the heroes ,  except segal's character and his dusky girlfriend ,  die heroically and steve-baby save the whole world in one swell foop ,  or fell swoop .  whatever .  made with some surplus air force and navy flying film .  and a lot of boom-booms .  get some popeye cartoons instead .
-1	steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources .  to pick on the technical flaws - silver f/a-18s and f-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike ,  and miraculously become camouflaged f-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves .  suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe ,  which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro .  putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu .
-1	'flight of fury' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film - i don't expect a lot from a seagal film ,  all i expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action -unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation ,  the action scenes are few and far between ,  the plot  ( which is totally irrelevant in these films )  is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout ,  the acting is truly abysmal - bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters - i find it hard to believe that anything close to $12m was spent on this dire mess unless $11m of that 12 was seagal's salary - i somehow doubt it !  the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that - it's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b-movies i've endured  1/10
-1	i usually don't comment anything  ( i read the others opinions )  .  .  .  but this ,  this one i _have_ to comment .  .  .  i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action ,  f-117 and other hi-tech stuff ,  but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind .  .  .  lousy acting ,  lousy script and a big science fiction .   it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  .  .   simply .  .  .  don't bother .  .  .   and one more thing ,  before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site .  .  .  3 . 7 points and i give this movie a try ,  now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
-1	following the appalling attack force ,  chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury .  to out-stink attack force would take some doing .  flight of fury is a marked improvement overall ,  but still in the grand scheme of thinks ,  mediocre .  mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days ,  a sad insight into his movie career's decline .  where attack force was a hodge-podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception ,  to filming ,  to post production ,  flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple .  someone steals a high-tech stealth fighter ,  planning to use it to fire chemical weapons  ( which we later ,  bizarrely discover ,  will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs )  .  seagal has to get the plane back .  it's that simple ,  no annoying sub-plots ,  and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works .  that's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though ,  it's pretty poor .  the introduction to side characters is badly done for example .   in filmic terms fof is bad .  it's badly acted by all involved ,  and seagal looks bored to tears almost .  he's just got the look of a toddler who's been forced to perform the school nativity against his will ,  and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness .  can we blame seagal though when the material is so un-ambitious and cruddy ?  not really .  this is the final film of his castel studio's ,  multi-picture deal .  the producers can't be bothered to make anything remotely good ,  promising a 12 or so million dollar budget ,  and  ( after seagal's obligatory 5 million )  probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves  ( if the film was made for the remaining 7 million ,  then i'm elvis pressley !  )  .  so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that's already got distribution sorted before it's made .  fan's though may argue ,  he at least owes them the effort .  he's seriously looking jaded ,  and the continued use of stand ins and dub-overs is further indication of this .  michael keusch directs with some efficiency ,  while the cinematography is quite good ,  but in all technical areas  ( and as usual with castel ,  a bog standard stunt team )  there's nothing more than mediocrity ,  and nothing to help the film rise above its material ,  and bored leading man .  again there's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal ,  which in all truth we don't want to see .   overall the action isn't too bad .  it's nice and violent ,  and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty seagal beatings ,  but overall nothing special .  partly due to a poor stunt crew ,  and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting .  for me ,  shadow man was a more enjoyable film ,  because while ignoring the incoherent ,  jumbled ,  plot line ,  there were more vintage seagal moments ,  and more of him in centre stage .  he never disappeared for long periods during the film .  seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here ,  and re-appears after ,  with little explanation .  there's far too much stock footage used .  using stock shots isn't an entirely horrendous thing ,  but using it as a crutch is .  we're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships ,  all the time ,  which get annoying .  plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place  ( just check the backdrops ,  chopping and changing )  .   the film is just middle of the road .  it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless ,  and gratuitous girl on girl scene ,  with two hot chicks .  seagal even perks up briefly then too !  overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there ,  but that's not saying much at all .  this will please many fans ,  but they should bear in mind ,  seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence .  **
-1	i can't believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors .  i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does .  when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong .   the plot is unbelievable as a movie ,  and even if you excuse the visuals ,  and had read this story as a novel ,  you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book .   steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation .  he shows no effort and no enthusiasm ,  and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all .   i hate to repeat other peoples comments ,  but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic .  the condition of those scenes chopped in ,  is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time .  the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner .   my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie ,  it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds .  i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget  ( segal being paid 5 of that )  and that the movie still came in under budget .  i must concur .   it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie ,  as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie  .
-1	humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film ,  and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended .  believe me  ,  he made the wrong choice !  presumably ,  after the success of  " dodge city "  ,  warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies ,  like alan hale ,  guinn  ( big boy )  williams ,  frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel ,  but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v .  randolph scott ,  and as a singer to really make things bad ,  because she proved one thing ,  and that is she cannot sing .  the story was not too bad ,  but with bogie clearly miscast also ,  it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong ,  and on a low budget ,  but in fairness ,  color would not have helped .
-1	it has been said ,   " a city on hill cannot hide itself "  and virginia city ,  nevada ,  perched on the side of mt .  davidson at 6200 ft .  west of tahoe ,  is a prime example ,  or in the context of the movie ,  should be .  virginia city exploded in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver ,  suspiciously the same year the civil war began .  it was the birthplace of the dean of american letters ;  it was where a young reporter named samuel clemens began using the name  " mark twain "  and went on to become america's most famous writer .  it was also the birthplace of the great hearst fortune ,  and the launching pad of john mackay ,  who became the wealthiest man in america ,  the third wealthiest man in the world .  hey ,  they should have made the movie about him !  in the 1860's virginia city was the boomtown of all boomtowns ,  the home of the big bonanza ,  at one time the largest  " metropolitan "  area west of st .  louis and east of san francisco .  but virginia city  ( the movie )  misses all that and is more about a hogwash north/south duello between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott .  flynn is capt .  kerry bradford ,  a union officer who is a pow in a concentration camp run by a mean confederate commander named capt .  vance irby ,  played by scott .  these two are always getting in each other's way .  bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being  " snuck "  out of vc by who else other than  .   .   .  irby !   " hey ,  what's he doing here !  ?  "  horrible .  bogart plays a laughable mexican bandit who can't decide who's side he's on .  miriam hopkins plays a murky character named  " julia hayne "  ,  obviously a historical lunge at the town's first lady ,  julia bulette ,  who in real life a celebrated prostitute .  she goes to washington and talks honest abe about saving bradford  ( not irby )  from hanging and blah blah blah .  go figure .  they shoulda hung the writer .  in  " real life "  twain reports that on the last day of the war ,  the setting sun caused the american flag atop mt .  davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire ,  kind of like the movie .  three days later they discovered that on that day the south capitulated .  one interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks alan hale and guin williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot ,  like they're fishing ,  or trying to make the bullets go faster .  not a bad idea for the movie .  the same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie .  gosh ,  how could they miss the gold madness ,  profligate wealth ,  gun battles in the silver mines ,  mark twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown ,  the crooked railroad ,  the opera house fire ,  artemis ward ,  bulette's huge funeral ,  the chinese tongs ,  the black saloons ,  the auction  .   .   ?  all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert ?  the truth was unreal .  did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust ?  well ,  if you count this movie ,  it wouldn't be the first debacle to come out of virginia city .  it's a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a  " city of illusions ,  "  where it is said evil seeps out of the ground  .   .   .  okay ,  other than that it's a fun movie .  flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying .  if flynn would just play his rotten self i'd double my rating .
-1	being a fan of cheesy horror movies ,  i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try .  now that i've seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet .  i get my movie rentals for free ,  and i feel that i didn't get my moneys worth .  i've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time ,  hell i'm a fan of them ,  but this was just an insult .
-1	pathetic .  .  .  worse than a bad made-for-tv movie .  i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick .  for some reason morgan freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying  " pussy "  when referring to nsync boy's girlfriend .  morgan freeman calling women  " pussy "  is just awkward .  .  .  what the hell were the people behind this film thinking ?  too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting ,  confusing camera angles ,  a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable .   i rented this flop with low expectations .  .  .  .  but .  .  .  well .  .  .  it really sucked .
-1	slashers  ( 2 outta 5 stars )   not really a very good movie .  .  .  but i did like the idea behind it .  .  .  and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with .  the movie is ostensibly an  " episode "  of a live japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off  " danger zone "  and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them .  the survivor ,  if there is one ,  wins fame and fortune .  .  .  everyone else just winds up dead .  the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad .  none of the  " real "  people seem real at all .  the actors playing the killers are kind of fun .  .  .  because they are portraying cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types .  .  .  and that's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show .  the movie pretends to be done all in one take .  .  .  there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the  " danger zone "  and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera .  .  .  but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly  ( to hide the  " cuts "  from one take to another ,  i would imagine )  .
-1	how can this movie have a 5 . 5 this movie was a piece of skunk s**t .  first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded .  because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut  ( that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick  ( that really cheap as* flimsy piece of wood )  and he did not even think he could cut threw it ) second the person who did the set sucks as* at supplying things for them to build with .  the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t . v .  show .  bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s**t they call a movie .   rating : 0 . 3
-1	i have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film .  one thing i see ,  over and over ,  is annoyance with megan ,  the idealistic political scientist ,  trying to change the world .  i loved her character .  maybe ,  because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think i'm going to change the world too ,  so i relate to megan .  besides ,  she's cute .  she's no super model ,  but more of a cute girl next door .   ok ,  so she cried and screamed a lot .  it's very dramatic ,  and seems overdone ,  but doesn't it fit her character ?  she goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point .  she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick .  i think she made her argument very well .  of course ,  being a young naive girl ,  she is terrified of what she is about to face .  i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear .  furthermore ,  i think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in .   as for the movie in general ,  other than megan ,  it was pretty much what i expected .  it had excellent gore scenes ,  by micro-budget standards .  the plot maybe took a quick thought ,  hardly any contemplation .  it's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film ,  which the name implies .  i love the sadism of the doctor .  he kept ripping megan's shirt off ,  not just for the cause of sleaze  ( though largely so )  ,  but also to torment her ,  before he kills her .  the chainsaw hick was hilarious .  for slasher film lovers ,  he was probably the best character .   i give this film 4 out of 10 .  it had a good setting ,  almost no plot ,  and a mix of good and terrible acting .  i would recommend it for a cheap thrill ,  but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror .
-1	its spelled s-l-a-s-h-e-r-s .  i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs .  that was pretty tight .  before and after that the movie pretty much blows .  the acting is like e-list and it's shown well in the movie .  not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person .  the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film .  the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny .  they said many stupid things that made me laugh .  other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman 2 .  anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .
-1	slashers .  .  .  .  . well if you like horrors its definitely one to see ,  otherwise don't even bother . it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget ,  for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere ,  and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow ,  trust me you wont need to look for them . also try to ignore the cheesy actors ,  if thats what you call them !  ! the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich .  now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days , for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game !  especially for $12 . 000 . 000 .  so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind .
-1	i couldn't help but think of behind the mask :  the rise of leslie vernon  ( a massively more amazing film )  when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea .  this could have been a great film .  the acting is .  .  . from some of the actors alright .  from others .  .  . it's downright horrible .   that aside the idea is great and the format is great .  the story is pretty good as well ,  though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind .   nevermind that though right ?  it is a horror movie after all .   i really want to see this remade .  .  . i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be .   however  ( and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this )  this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget .  and the fx really hurt the film overall .   great movie .   .  .  . if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx .   whoever wrote it should keep going though ,  great idea here .
-1	more wide-eyed ,  hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social ,  pathological behaviour .  danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy .   it's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead  ( or in nursing homes )  .  i kinda thought about suing them for torture .  as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor ,  defenseless ear-drums ,  i felt instant ,  strong pain envelop my entire being .  that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits ,  nevermind glass .    " why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it ?  "  ,  you might ask angrily .  fair point ,  fair point .  .  .  the answer is that i wanted to ,  but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor ,  writhing in agony .  with my last ounces of energy ,  i tried to reach the remote but couldn't .   a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven ,  who then proceeds to  " pigmalionize "  him .  lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson ,  but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up .  this may seem like a rather thin plot ,  but this noisy movie is so chock-full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all .  this movie is relentless .  forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer's  " reign in blood "   ( as in a south park episode )  .  whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world ,  it's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year-olds impersonating grown-ups .  i can only envy people who find movies like this funny .  it must be great being easy-to-please :  what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious ,  gut-busting comedy .    but let's examine this phenomenon ,  the 50s musical .  my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day-dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven  ( depending on whether you're church-going or lenin's-tomb-going )  ,  or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy-inspired places .  ttono is more akin to a representation of hell ,  but that's just me .  i don't seem to  " get "  musicals .  people talk ,  there is a story - but then all-of-a-sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened !  when you think about it ,  musicals are stranger than any science-fiction film .   worse yet ,  ttono  ( my favourite type of pizza ,  btw )  is not just a 50s musical ,  but one with opera squealing .  opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure .  the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet .  i tried lowering the volume .  i lowered it from 18 to 14 .  then from 14 to 10 .  then 8 .  i ended up lowering it to a 1 ,  which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially-trained dogs and certain types of marsupials ,  and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys !   take the scene in the small boat in the river .  danza starts off with one of his deafening ,  brain-killing tunes ,  and then .  .  .  nothing .  no animals anywhere to be seen .  even the crocodiles ,  who are mostly deaf ,  have all but left .  if you look carefully ,  you might even see the trees change colour ,  from green to yellow ,  in a matter of minutes .  no ,  this was not a continuity error ,  it was plain old torture of the flora .  and those trees were just matte paintings !  imagine how real trees would have reacted .   the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency ,  but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion .  i can listen to the loudest ,  least friendly death metal band for hours ,  but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache .
-1	a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify lanza's mgm contract at the time .   as reported by member lastliberal  ( above )  grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off  ( and sometimes on )  camera .  in addition ,  his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable .  after doing their second  ( and last )  film together ,   " toast of new orleans "  ,  the normally quiet grayson stormed into louie b .  mayer's office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period .  mayer felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza ,  so grayson's statement stuck .  grayson went on to star in a number of widely received  ( and far more profitable )  musicals with howard keel and others .  later in life when asked to compare lanza and keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them ,  and that keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the  " real people "  in the audiences .
-1	i really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv ,  which is were i live ,  acting in it .  this town is dull and so is this film .  there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show .  this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any .  unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday ,  then stay away from this movie .  the dialog will put you to sleep ,  the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this .  its a predictable movie with no surprises .  what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator .
-1	this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california .  she thought it was wonderful because it was so real ,   " just the way people in the ohio valley are !  "  i'm from the area and i experienced the film as  " just the way people in california think we are !  "  i've lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there .  we laughed a lot ,  we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age ;  the young people went out together at night .  the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families .  the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else .   aside from the  " if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed "  condescension ,  the story lacked any elements of charm ,  mystery or even a sense of dread .   martha's character was the worst drawn .  it's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church ,  but if she had ,  she probably would have made friends there .  i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was  " younger ,  prettier and thinner "  but if this is the case it isn't shown .  all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender .  we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions ,  left out of the loop when social plans are made ,  used but not appreciated ,  and finally disrespected and hurt .   just one more thing :  are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks ?  please .  this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .
-1	when thinking of the revelation that the main character in  " bubble "  comes to at films end ,  i am reminded of last years  " machinist "  with christian bale .  the only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters .   an understated ,  yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life .  the title is cause for contemplation .  perhaps ,  we ,  the audience are the ones in the  " bubble "  as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time .  audience reactions were often smug and judgmental ,  clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves .  these characters are the ones people refer to as those that put george w .  back in office for a second term .   it's sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role .  this film has it's merits ,  and is deserving of consideration for the things it doesn't say outright .
-1	i just saw this at the venice film festival ,  and can't quite decide about it .  we were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them .  maybe that was the point ,  that we are all in a  " bubble "  of our own ,  but these people didn't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates .  at a running time of just over an hour ,  the characters weren't very well developed .  lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment  ( forklifts ,  conveyor belts ,  shovels )  ;  and the slightly-creepy-looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes ,  that most of the characters made for a living ,  were somehow more interesting than the live people .  an interesting experiment ,  but somehow it never quite came together .
-1	the movie itself is not too bad ;  many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script ,  but it is watchable .  what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies ,  and on top of that for movies like this one .  i have to admit i had never heard the man's name before watching this ,  but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed .  the voice is crap ,  the face is a bad rip-off of legolas ,  the posture is horrible ,  and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them .  said to say ,  i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco ,  because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only .  too bad i was wrong .  these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance ,  and they are the main reason i give this a 4 .    i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast .  .  .  and cannot believe it .
-1	san francisco is a big city with great acting credits .  in this one ,  the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city .  they didn't even manage the most basic of realistic details .  so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie .  you will not be thinking  " oh ,  i've been there ,  "  you will be thinking  " how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby ?  "  some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations .  it detracts ,  but the acting was always competent .   the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles ,  at least in the beginning .  the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting .  the plot is weak ,  ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies .  the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance ,  they were framed and paced better .  but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries .   the white boy intro was pointless .  i think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it ,  so they left it loosely structured and cut it down .  the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really ,  folks ,  everyone knows it's not  " groovy "  to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous .  they threw away some good opportunities .  educated and embittered on the west coast ,  a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york .  they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable .  that would have been interesting ;  this was not .   the hunter's point intro was the most disappointing .  it was the most derivative of the three ,  and stylistically the most distant from san francisco .  you've seen it done before and you've seen it done better .  even the video game was better !    despite the generic non-locality and aimless script ,  these characters have potential ,  the actors have talent ,  and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction .  .  .  about ten minutes before the ending .  good concept placed in the wrong hands .   ps ,  there is a missing minority here ,  see if you can guess which one .
-1	if he wanted to be accurate ,  he should have chosen some frisco natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the sucka free  ( not sucker free )  .  i've lived in sf my entire life ,  and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did .  everything was over-dramatized ,  and the only cat i saw from the bay was jt the bigga figga with his little cameo as a rapper .  no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here  ( ie his warriors jersey )  .  not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or 9ers gear ;  instead he fitted them in some cheesy made-up sf or oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here .  hp has no bowling alleys ,  black and asian gangbangers do not wear head or wristbands with the colors of africa or china's olympic team ,  nor does every chinese gangster wear a yao ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops .  further ,  while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission ,  all that was shown was some white dude and a self-proclaimed  " 100% west coast boriqua .  "  this is not new york !  puerto ricans here are few and far between ,  and the latinos in the mission are very ,  very different from the one that was shown here ,  who was without a doubt from ny .  also ,  hp is not the only black neighborhood in the city .  an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between hp sets in their own hood as well as vs .  fillmore ,  sunnydale ,  lakeview ,  etc .    this film could've been much better if lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .
-1	this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist .  the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k .  it's super bowl at the superdome in new orleans .  however ,  no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing .  with the many stars in this film ,  it made no difference .  i really don't know why i watched this .
-1	superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made .  the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl ,  and all the attempts made to stop them .  how tom selleck and donna mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me .  however ,  the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all !  avoid this one if possible .
-1	it's 1978 ,  and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well !  fans will be upset and certainly the 75 , 000 seats will be full ,  only less happy there are so many black players on the field !  this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable .  it's not much more ,  but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance  ( for the time )  ,  probably most notably tom selleck .  unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen ,  is quickly trumped by  " actors "  like dick butkus .   it's a silly story about super bowl betting .  pj jackson is charged by  " new york "   ( read mafia )  for ensuring the game ends for their favor ,  in this case a $10 , 000 , 000 bet .  pj is innocent enough ,  and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there .  but things seem to fall apart for him .  another person ,  the unsuspected lainie ,  takes charge .  for a while ,  the mystery of murders isn't known for certain ,  but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist .   it's a bad movie ,  but is watchable .  the acting is decent ,  and the filming is ok .  at least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases  ( they have their place just not here )  .  just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you'll survive .   2/10  ( maybe a 2 . 5 )
-1	the championship game is only a couple of days away ,  but things in new orleans aren't as they should be .  from players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose ,  life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable ,  wonderful time .  can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined ?    despite what you might think when you first read about superdome ,  this is not a football movie .  in fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought .  instead ,  superdome is another of those lousy soap opera-ish 70s made-for-tv movies populated with hollywood has beens and those that never will be .  the cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good .  the best  ( or worst )  example is van johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there .  the plot is dull ,  uninteresting ,  and unbelievable .  donna mills as a hit " man "  ?  yeah ,  right !  it's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked david jansen .  the movie also lacks any pace .  trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow superdome might have had .  with no drama or suspense in sight ,  superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made-for-tv movie .  the lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late charlie jones - a sportscaster i miss listening to .  the eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in new orleans is pure cheese at its finest .   like most others who have seen superdome ,  i also did so courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 .  it may be one of the ktma public access episodes ,  but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start .  so even though i've only rated superdome a 2/10 ,  i'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my mst3k rating scale .
-1	comparison with american graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic .  speaking of timeliness ,  there was an episode of cheers where norm and cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie .  they would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong .  there were sly reference such as 'they paved paradise to put up a parking lot' .  the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan .   the characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers .  almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie .  very little of what the characters said were believable .  combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail .  although ,  there were two exceptions kelli williams liven things up as the future flower child and ,  despite what another reviewer said ,  rick shroeder was quite good .  showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in  " n . y . p . d .  blues "  .
-1	oh dear god .  this was horrible .  there is bad ,  then there was this .  this movie makes no sense at all .  it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all .  the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman .  the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city ,  takes away .  since i live in vancouver ,  watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable .  why didn't they make it a real city ?  the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job .  he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy .  it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time ,  and the movie be a washout .  too bad .  hopefully someone important will see it ,  and at least give john heard credit where credit is due ,  and hire him as lead bad guy again ,  which is where he should be .  on the a list .
-1	when i spotted that noah wyle and ricky schroder were in the same movie ,  i was like ,  score !  i admit ,  i was eager to see the movie .  and i have to say ,  the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way .  then it went all down hill .  i didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo .  they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story .  i was appalled that noah was involved in anything of the sort ,  especially his role .  nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war .  if anyone really wants to know how communism was like ,  sit down and read a book on it .  and not one that praises it or is against it ,  just the cold hard facts .   i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky's body ,  but that was all that interested me .  everything else about this movie irritated me .
-1	no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie .  it's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch .  bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a disneyland attraction .  students fist-fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue .  the watts riots with a cast of .  .  . ugh .  .  . 10 ?  ?  dermot mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary hartman look-alike with the most annoying smile since 'mr .  sardonicus' .  noah wyle reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift .  drunken virgin rick schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service .  silly ,  giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of 'shindig' ,  sing horribly off key ,  and actually make it big in the music business .  and who wrote this compelling dialog ?  :   " i'm going to burkley and wear flowers in my hair "  .  .  .  .  " i think i found someone to buy stick's woody !  "  .  .  .  .  " these people are 'animals' !  "   " these people are my 'family' !  as the shirelles sing  " mama said "  .  oh brother ,  what a mess .  this is like a 'reefer madness' of the 60's except it's not even funny .
-1	i saw this back in '94 when it was finally released .  apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy ,  i think ,  the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier .   i have problem remembering details partly because i haven't seen it in a long time ,  but i do remember it as a very dull movie .  i kept debating whether to walk out of it .  the store was not at all interesting or engaging .  was a 3rd rate america graffiti imitation .    none of the performances make it worth watching either .  one of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating .
-1	couldn't go to sleep the other night .  so i got up ,  flipped on the tube & this movie was on .   film makers bit off more than they could chew .  just as ambitious in scope as  " forrest gump "  was .  but gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era .  tgmb just relies on tired clichés to tell the story .  almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up .  every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype .   take how we're introduced to finnegan :  hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of mlk .  criminey ,  talk about heavy-handed .  why not just give him a t-shirt saying  " i heart black people "  ?   sunshine :   " isn't free love groovay ,  man ?  oh no ,  i didn't have my period .  "    mary beth :   " i want to go to berkeley ,  not square ucla .  "  uh ,  excuse me ?  there was nothing square about la in the 60s .  rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique ,  we just hear this brat whine about not going there .   can't even remember the black kid's name .  he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are .   thing is ,  period pieces don't have to be this cheesy .  take  " dazed & confused .  "  look how we're introduced to the football hero ,  randall floyd .  we don't first see him on the football field .  in fact ,  we never see him play football .  we're introduced to him in class ,  inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party .   in  " dazed "  feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up .  it's much more organic ,  more serious than that .  it's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about gilligan's island .  serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings .  but real life is like that .   some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant .  i agree !  which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby-boomer pornostalgia .
-1	major league :  back to the minors  ( 1998 )  ½*   starring :  scott bakula ,  eric bruskotter ,  corbin bernsen ,  dennis haysbert ,  jensen daggett ,  written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg-13  ( for language and some violence )    by blake french :    	believe it or not ,  in the new john warren comedy  " major league :  back to the minors "  there is one funny scene .  it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face .  it's not much ,  but with the exception of a few one-liners ,  it's all this film has to offer .  .  . enough said .    this movie is not only structurally impaired ,  characteristically undeveloped ,  predictable and badly written ,  but also just plain bad .  even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got .  it is so familiar it just isn't funny .    how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made ?  last years we saw this same material in  " air bud :  golden receiver ,  "  and as bad as that film was ,  this is even worse .  at least  " air bud "  was family oriented .   " major league back to the minors "  is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon .  it is too childish for adults .  so who is this film for ?  teenagers ?  elderly ?  people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this ?   	the film ,  like many others like this ,  has one basic point it tries to make :  teamwork conquers all .  yes it does ,  and what a great moral to try to prove .  too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes .  where the silly announcers form their own  " buddy comedy routine "  muttering one liners to themselves like  " they suck ,  "   " this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass ,  "   " this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost--maybe it was his mind ,  "   " somebody needs a nap ,  "  and  " ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play .  "  where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name .  and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny .   	 " major league back to the minors "  is so bad ;  it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence .  the good baseball team is on a comeback ,  they are about to win and--the power goes out .  i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion ,  but in reality ,  its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time .  the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny .  there is another kind-of-funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer .  the coach's answer :   " you're too old ,  too slow ,  and too fat .  "  the player's reaction is to die for .  but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time ,  and certainly is not worth a cent of your money .    so here is another dreadful entrée into this genre of film ,  another that is doomed with its own script ,  which is failed before seen ,  and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again .
-1	this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen ,  the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film .  i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame !
-1	how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel ?  all it does is throw balls !  worst of all ,  it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series !  the comedy suffers from not being funny .  where did all the unintentional laughter go ?  enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long .  bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout .  what's next ,  major league 4 :  return to the little league ?  ehh ,  could be !  leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all-star game .  this one's had three strikes too many .
-1	this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise .  i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland .   ( yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good ,  and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league ,  but still be consistent .  )  anyway i loved the first major league ,  liked the second ,  and always looked forward to the third ,  when the indians would finally go all the way to the series .  you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed .  what happened ?  anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk .

-1	this movie is so bad it's funny .  it stars scott backula as some coach ,  but that's not important ,  what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base .  first off he has to be at least 75 years old ,  yet still plays minor league baseball ,  second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk ,  let alone run .  coach backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time .  backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film ,   ( spoiler )  ,  he tells his star player  " downtown "  to hit a home run ,  clearly  " downtown "  viewed this as a good move .  he hit the home run and won the game for his team ,  a minor league squad playing the twins who were the class of the majors in the movie .  now if only tony muser ,  manager of the royals ,  would be as smart a coach as backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat ,  the royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game .
-1	okay ,  just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie .  well ,  at least i did .  it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour .  *spoiler*  it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants .  the only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way .  she always wins the competitions ,  therefore pushing the mother further towards  " eliminating "  her .  after talking to a  " hitman "  ,  the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit .  so actions are taken but she eventually gets caught .   the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening .  don't waste your time watching this .
-1	this is one very dire production .  the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal ,  she was a very beautiful young woman .  here was the production's weakest point ,  the actress failed to get that across .  it also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset ,  the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush .  the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was farcical .   the production was a flaw ridden ,  cliché ridden ,  embarrassing load of rubbish .  i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas !
-1	there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video :  it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud .  the movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring .  just a notch above lowbrow  ( thanks to freeman and spacey ,  who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films )  ,  the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as justin timberlake's acting .  i hate to knock the guy ,  but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte ,  the better .   the movie isn't all bad .  .  . just mostly .  i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man .  he deserves it .  and ,  unlike his fellow musician and co-star ,  he can act .  kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well  ( you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery )  ,  and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars  ( out of ten .  .  . he's not that good )  .   when all is said and done ,  the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake .  it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters .  all in all ,  t's just plain boring .  that being said ,  rent this when you are suffering from insomnia .
-1	for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it .  i find it cute ,  cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie .  troops ,  swingblade ,  any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind .  if all that these directors want is a foot inside hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films .  how many times have you heard the phrase ,   " it's animal house meets back to the future "  ;   " it's wall street meets dead poet's society "  ;  or  " shakespeare in love meets star wars "  ?  i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable .
-1	way back in 1967 ,  a certain director had no idea about a galaxy ,  far away or near .  he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc .  this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george .  i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it .  this is merely an advertising promo for the director ,  actors ,  et .  al .  it has little intrinsic artistic value .  it is a brochure .  the lead playing george ,  is very fine ,  as is the leia character ,  and the ersatz darth character .  all else is plain commercial dross .  what a waste .  still ,  it got the job done i guess .  the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess .  a brochure only .
-1	where's michael caine when you need him ?  i've seen most of the many seasons of mst3k ,  but this rare pre-1st season flick  ( episdoe k-20 )  is easily one of the worst movies ever made .  three  " stars "  ,  lee majors ,  chris makepeace and burgess meredith ,  struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever ,  delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick cheney-style workgroup composed of exxon and gm lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research .  looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness ,  possibly on super 8 .  makes logan's run look like the cinematic sistine chapel crossed with shakespeare .  i can't imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and servo since it's unwatchable even with it .  clearly what's needed in hollywood is some sort of 401k which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care .  with its  " rights to pollute and drive "  theme ,  by the end ,  i'm half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his  " cold dead hands "  speech .  lee ,  i could have forgiven you for this in 1989 ,  but 1981 ?
-1	stupid ,  mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes  ( piloted by burgess meredith )  chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge ,  driven by lee majors ,  with chris makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously ,  and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society .  as moronic as it sounds .  terrible waste of burgess meredith ,  but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .
-1	this juvenile ,  bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens' bodies ,  desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years .  how  ?  by burning up gas and equating a fast ,  reckless car  ( or plane )  with freedom .   the plot borrows heavily from mister rogers' neighborhood  ( if it were run my an oil conglomerate )  and logan's run  ( if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style )  .   starring lee majors and burgess meredith this film is set in a post-gas-crisis world in which an all-powerful government doesn't want you to  ( *ahem* )  drive your car and burn gas .  sort of the opposite of today's enron-and-bush ,  oil-grabbing ,  suv-pushing government .   this juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable .  but wait .  .  . there's more .  although the film is set in the future ,  we're not shown any signs of future technology ,  beyond a return to bicycles ,  golf carts and horses .  you will believe that the future looks .  .  .  exactly like today .  same clothing ,  same suburban houses ,  same green lawns as today and when the film was made .  there are no solar panels ,  no windmills ,  no concessions to alternate energy .   the acting is flat and flavorless .  even scenes which could have been gritty or moving ,  buddy-flick ,  honor ,  romance ,  horror .  .  .  all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase .   continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by burgess meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again .   the plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a dukes of hazzard episode .   even die-hard car-film and sf fans should avoid this film like month-old roadkill ,  unless you enjoy heckling exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's gas tank .
-1	i saw this movie years ago ,  and i was impressed .  .  .  but then again i was only 12 years old .  i recently re-watched it and want that time back .  this film is pretty bad .  while i like lee majors ,  chris makepeace  ( watch my bodyguard  ( 1980 ) if you would like to see a good movie that he was in .  .  .  of meatballs  ( also starring bill murray )  for some laughs )  ,  and burgess meredith ,  this role does/did nothing for their careers .   anyway ,  lee majors character ,  franklyn hart ,  is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car  ( which he had in storage )  across the country to california .  one problem :  the government has outlawed all private transportation .  i thought the concept was ok  ( not the worse i've heard of )  ,  but the execution failed horribly .
-1	after watching this on the mst3k episode ,  i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from .  it seems to combine elements of logans run ,  farenheight 451 ,  final sacrifice and at least several others .  at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower .    i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot .  like the fact that ,  even though gas is unavailable ,  there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations ,  and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f1 race car going all the way across the country .
-1	dull ,  flatly-directed  " comedy "  has zero laughs and wastes a great cast .  alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows .  newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it's not enough .   one of those scripts that ,  if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer ,  would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion .
-1	honestly before i watched this movie ,  i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace .  i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie ,  and watched it by my own .  apparently they were right .  i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did i watch this movie .   of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie/theater business .  but morgan and kevin ?  i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison .  to be honest ,  their roles are rather stupid .   well you might think if the players suck ,  then i should pay more attention to the story .  it is indeed story is the core of a movie ,  but guys .  .  .  trust me .  .  .  this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story .  imagine this ,  a smart-ass journalist  ( justin timberlake )  wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a 'real' journalist from his boss  ( morgan freeman )  .  this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice  ( ll cool j )  and an brilliant investigator  ( kevin spacey )  .  at the end ,  they beat the system with a happy ending story .   jeez ,  i could not even carry on with this .  just recalling the movie is making me sick already .  my advise guys ,  don't watch this !  please save your money and time for another movie .
-1	one of the lamer wedding movies you'll see .  smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters .  the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke ,  except they just aint in the least bit funny here .  molly ringwald ,  well what else needs to be said .  give you a clue to the silliness ,  she destroys a $10 , 000 wedding dress ,  because  " it just won't be me "  makes it into this rag ,  with straps and puts on a top hat ,  and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy ,  rather than ringwalding her neck .  its a helluva a cast too ,  check out how heavy ally sheedy is .  wheeeew !
-1	with this film ,  bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity' .  obviously ,  it is not .  for one reason ,  many scenes 'shot by pure chance' are obvious set-ups  ( when that poor goat 'accidently' falls off the cliff ,  you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen !  )  .  for another ,  his concealing of one important information :  the hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film .  that is ,  goitre ,  a sickness caused by lack of iodine  ( salt )  .  this goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had bunuel only took the time to make his research  ( heck ,  if he checked 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary he'd have found 'goitre' )  he might have ended up telling the truth about these people  ( still ,  doubtfully )  .  instead ,  with his film ,  he judges them constantly ,  talking about them as 'cretins' ,  again and again ,  dramatizing the action ,  setting-up scenes to create the spectacle ,  all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all-mighty objectivity .  bunuel talks all the time in this film ,  not letting one word to the people he is filming .  he talks for them and ,  even then ,  judges them .  this piece is flawed to it's roots ,  to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film .
-1	this 30 minute documentary buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of spain's poorest regions is ,  in my opinion ,  one of his weakest films .  first ,  let's admit that 70 years later ,  spain is much richer than it was then  ( and when i say this ,  i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own ,  like excessive individualism and consumerism ,  though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here )  .  and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored ,  but with western european style capitalism .  but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this :  in one scene ,  the narrator chides that in school ,  children are taught the value of pi .  teaching math to poor people ,  the horror !  .  buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here ,  not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation .  what is he proposing ?  that children are taught exactly what at school ?  doesn't buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people ?
-1	the writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film .  i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey ,  because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun .    the story was awful ,  the characters were very one dimensional .  for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans ,  that someone is kidding their self  ( it was probably the writer/director )  .  no poker fan in this world likes this movie .  even your money man hates this project .  to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker .  keep your day job .  and if it's playing poker ,  then you must be hurt'n .
-1	as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially as it had scotty nyugen in it .   basically ,  scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it .   the characters are unlikeable and annoying ,  the soundtrack is awful and the plot ,  well ,  there isn't one .   i honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored .  its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn't have wasted $16 buying it off ebay .   take it from me - avoid like 7 2 offsuit !  !  !  dire .   :  (
-1	totally ridiculous .  if you know anything about poker ,  you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless .  the nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker ,  but i doubt he's ever played above 3-6 .   ( i think he also knows nothing of golf .  )  where to start .  i've seen better productions in the intro to film class i took freshmen year of film school .  the actors to watch in this movie are queen momma ,  scotty nguyen ,  and the loser who can never win at poker .  everyone else is as wooden as they come ,  like bad porn actors .   *spoiler* the man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made .  he is a railbird who doesn't play poker and never has a line of dialogue ,  but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie .  i can't think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production .  it's fitting that he had such a useless role .   there's very little poker in this movie .  most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots aren't resolved in the slightest .  queen momma does have a show-stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out .  also the nameless arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them .  their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights .  it makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads .   in conclusion ,  complete nonsense .  plan 9 from outer space has slightly more coherency .  if you play poker though you might want to have a laugh .  also if you're christian you might enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper .  i hate movies made by religious people .  especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about .  it's sad that jennifer harman and scotty nguyen got involved in this travesty as i can't help but think less of them .  they must be envious of johnny chan for getting in rounders .
-1	when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one .  now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd  (  they had not viewed it on the silver screen  )  ,  my opinion remains the same .  the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .
-1	people ,  please don't bother to watch this movie !  this movie is bad !  it's totally waste of time .  i don't see any point here .  it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor .  i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again .
-1	an updated version of a theme which has been done before .  while that in and of itself is not bad ,  this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other  " inherent and pure "  evil ones do .    predictable ,  ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark .  not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending .
-1	this is a typical  " perfect crime "  thriller .  a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ,  ignoring all the clues ,  immediately knows who guilty is .  the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught .  the result is like every single episode of  " columbo "  or  " murder she wrote "  .  the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock !  this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book .  skip this one ,  you are not missing anything .
-1	murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-tv but isn't .  considering the only actor of any note is bullock  ( although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things )  ,  it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things .  like .  .  .  remembering to lock your front door when you go out .  or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower .   bullock plays cassie mayweather ,  a cop with personal issues  ( don't they all )  .  together with her new partner  ( a wet-looking ben chaplin )  ,  she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman .  nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they've planned and executed the perfect murder .  as the investigation continues ,  a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood  ( ryan gosling )  .   the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless .  bullock ,  though she is very nice to look at ,  is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield  ( actually ,  he'd be better !  )  .  chaplin ,  for his sins ,  is a complete non-entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood .  at least gosling and pitt ,  as the conniving sneering suspects ,  acquit themselves adequately .  as if dodgy leads weren't bad enough ,  a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable  ( but illogical )  ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run .    " murder by numbers "  has absolutely nothing going for it ,  even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn't redeem it .  well ,  just a little but still not enough to save it .  forgettable ,  predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward .  as cassie probably says on her next case ,  there's nothing to see here people .  move along ,  keep moving .  .  .
-1	lets enter the world of this movie for a second ,  so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here .   edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50 , 000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars ,  shouting at them ,  and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him .  .  .  .  .  . instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief .  .  .  . instead of just walking up and pop !  .  .  .  .  . what do you do ?  the bad guy .  .  .  .  . he talks to him .  he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun .  they have nothing to talk about !  shoot him !  shoot him now !  but he talks to him anyway .  oh another thing .  at the end ,  a newspaper says  " pulitzer prize winner story right here "  or something right above on a front page of a paper ,  when its like the first time the story is printed .  so how in the heezy did someone win a pulitzer for it that fast ?  yea ,  you know those types of stupid movies ?  yea well that's edison in a nutshell .   you get mr cool morgan freeman and shifty eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely ,  ll cool j who scowls literally every single moment of the movie , while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places , and who's last line  " duck "  was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made .  .  .  and justin timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks ,  little cocky bastard . the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best  " denzel from training day "  impression ,  which was pretty entertaining .   oh yea so whats the movie about ?  eh ,  something about scandals involving the city edison's fictional special unit police force called  " f . r . a . t .   ( i swear i'm not making this stuff up )  which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s . w . a . t .  anyway little journalistic super singer boy justin timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from frat ,  and he goes scurrying off looking for a story ,  gaining his boss'  ( freeman )  trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought .  blah blah blah .  its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day . the pacing was slow and off ,  the script was horrible ,  and the acting was extremely uninspired .  it jumped everywhere without going anywhere .  people get put in comas and you forget about them .  everyone in this movie just didn't think .  damn what a stupid movie .  its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended .  .  . no lie basically ,  do not waste your time !
-1	well ,  the writing was very sloppy ,  the directing was sloppier ,  and the editing made it worse  ( at least i hope it was the editing )  .  the acting wasn't bad ,  but it wasn't that good either .  pretty much none of the characters were likable .  at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential .  it was a great idea ,  but yet another wasted good idea goes by .  it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending .  and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter .  the ending was not worth watching at all .  sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies .  the movie looked rushed also .  the movie just wasn't really worth seeing ,  and had i paid for it i would have been very mad .  maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one .  the movie over all was not horrifibly bad ,  but i wouldn't reccomend it .  i gave it 2 out of 10 b/c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character  ( justin i believe ,  the super smart one )  .  and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes .  it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape ,  it was not pretty .  anyway ,  if you see it ,  wait for the $1 . 50 theater or video ,  unless you like pretty much every movie you see ,  then i guess you'll like this one .
-1	at first the movie seemed to be doing great ,  they had the characters profiles set .  .  . the plot seemed to be going in the right direction .  .  .  however ,  as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things .  .  . or just a lot was edited from the movie .  the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie .  also ,  there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning -- in other words -- they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself .  and the title .  .  .  no where in the movie does the title fit the movie .  .  . i suppose the title works for the previews .  .  .  .  actors did well with what they had .  .  .  .  . if they had a better director and writer ,  maybe this would have worked out better .  but it didn't .  so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday .  .  .  .  my opinion !  .  .  .  . don't waste your time or money .
-1	so ,  i'm wondering while watching this film ,  did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her  " before "  clothes from miss congeniality ?  did ms .  bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the  " before "  gracie hart ?  as many reviewers have noted before ,  the film is very formulaic .  add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest .   the two bad boy serial killers have been done before  ( and better )  in other films .  as has the  " good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence "  character been seen before .  in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes .   one last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising .  murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer .  you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .
-1	from director barbet schroder  ( reversal of fortune )  ,  i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class ,  and i recognised the leading actress ,  so i tried it ,  despite the rating by the critics .  basically cool kid richard haywood  ( half nelson's ryan gosling )  and justin pendleton  ( bully's michael pitt )  team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them .  investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie 'the hyena' mayweather  ( sandra bullock )  with new partner sam kennedy  ( ben chaplin )  ,  who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene ,  e . g .  non-relating hairs .  the plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects ,  it is just a question of if they can sway them away .  also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills ,  chris penn as ray feathers ,  r . d .  call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst .  d . a .  al swanson .  i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock's rope with the murdering for a challenge thing ,  but this film does it in a very silly way ,  and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable .  adequate !
-1	alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of : he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him .   the main subject of this bullock vehicle  , all the ideas , almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic  "  rope "  : the two students who commit a gratuitous crime ,  nietsche's philosophy , and the clues that the boys disseminate  , the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force .    " murder by numbers  "  does not take place in a single room , like  " the rope "   , mind you . and  , what a supreme originality , it pits two cops against the evil youngsters ; and  , you would never guess it , these two cops are very different : actually , bullock plays the part of woman living like a man  , and her partner  ( chaplin )  is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys' performances are not really mind-boggling  , not as good  , as  , say  , that of edward norton in  " primal fear "   .   well , you know  ,  "  rope "  was so good  .  .  .  .
-1	there's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'murder by numers' because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out .  however ,  by the time the credits roll ,  there's no saving it .  the whole thing is pretty much blown by the  " cop side "  of the story ,  where sandra bullock and ben chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on .  although bullock is strong in her role ,  it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing .  ben chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role  ( he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'birthday girl' )  as well as chris penn ,  who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him .  anyway ,  the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all .  the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie .  their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well .  it's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film .  barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker .  bottom line :  it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan ,  but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it ,  except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks .
-1	having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullock's performance in miss congeniality ,  i decided to give murder by numbers a shot .  while decent in plucky ,  self-effacing roles ,  ms .  bullock's performance in  " serious "  roles  ( see hope floats ,  speed 2 ,  28 days )  leave much to be desired .  her character is at the same time omniscient ,  confused ,  and sexually maladjusted  ( the sub-plot of sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character )  .  the two teenage boys gave decent performances ,  although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream  " we did it !  "  chris penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here ,  as is ben chaplin's token partner/love interest character .   ***spoilers ahead*** mediocre acting aside ,  the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place ,  and as mentioned ,  the stupid errors  ( vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene ,  an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor ,  the two boys hanging out together in public ,  a convenient love interest to cause friction ,  etc .  etc )  cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers .  the ending was strictly  " by the numbers "  and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie .  using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film ,  and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment ,  the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion .  a somewhat promising concept ,  but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way .  * out of **** .
-1	hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse  ( 1976 )  ,  and now only seems to do  " by the numbers "  hollywood thrillers .   this is very lightweight john grisham material ,  crossed with the plot of a tv movie .  bullock is cass mayweather ,  a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers .  ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy ,  and together they make an uncomfortable duo .  not good ,  when two unbalanced college maladriots  ( gosling and pitt )  decide to send them on a wild goose chase - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene .   fair enough ,  but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks ,  we also have to endure a several dull overly-melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history .  then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff-side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set .  oooh .  .  .  the atmosphere .   watch any episode of csi instead .  it's to the point and far more exciting .
-1	except for acknowledging some nice cinematography ,  i can hardly say anything positive about this movie .  the single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life .  abundant  " emotionally powerful "  scenes do not go with this plot and ,  because of bad acting ,  they also fail to create the intended atmosphere .  the director only manages to introduce anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution .  the characters do not seem to evolve ,  although it is difficult to speak of any characters .  .  .  perhaps except for sonny .  beside him ,  actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to ,  they come off as self-indulging amateurs .  i wonder what ruined the movie more :  the superficial script ,  throwing away all the potential of the plot ,  or the bad acting ,  disturbing any appeal that might be left .
-1	the movie started off strong ,  ll cool j  ( deed )  as an undercover police officer ,  with partner sgt .  lazerov  ( dylan mcdermott from the practice ,  possibly miscast as a bad guy ?  )  committing robbery and murder .  deed refuses to kill the drug dealer ,  which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience .  the other big names  ( freeman ,  spacey et al )  are well cast and the movie shows promise .   the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake  ( pollack )  is introduced .  given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly ,  or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake ,  i would choose the former .  even talented actors have to work hard at their craft ;  timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him .  i would have thought he would put on a better show ,  given the fact that he has been acting talented for years .  everything he did in this film was unconvincing .   just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums ,  it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films .  even hardcore n'sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent .   that aside there are a few plot holes ,  such as pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery .  this movie had so much promise .  thoroughly disappointing .
-1	they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station .  they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived .  you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot ,  four young boys playing in grainy slow motion ,  accompanied by voice over narration .  next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion .  once they're grown ,  it's easy to spot the writer/director among the four .  he's the quiet ,  contemplative ,  long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants .  this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood .  only there's no writing ,  or directing talent on display here .  and if you still can't figure out which one he is ,  here's a hint :  the auteur and his character have the same middle name .  it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school .  what looked like a prison was apparently a high school ,  the warden turned out to be the principal .  once more ,  the poor ,  misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement ,  murder and pillage ,  but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father .  how about hitting back ,  kid ,  like you do everyone else ?  numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose .  howlingly bad dialogue .  many scenes badly out of focus .  cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras ,  drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience .  overacting in the extreme .  and if you don't quite get the self-important speeches ,  or the slow-motion scenes ,  just listen to the overbearing music .  it will clue you in and what you're supposed to feel .  poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films .  the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies ,  run over puppies chained to a tree ,  rob and steal ,  all the while complaining about their sad ,  sorry lives .  but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college .  yeah ,  that's the ticket .  why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important ,  so interesting ,  that the world can't wait to see it onscreen ?  if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems ,  then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants .
-1	a lot of people seemed to have liked the film ,  so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review .  but after sitting through 96 minutes of it ,  i feel i have to do so .  where the heck is the plot in this film ?  !  i must have missed it ,  i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened .  sure the ending was  " somewhat shocking "  but they didn't build up to it .  i forgot who was who half of the time ,  so they didn't really develop the characters .  the acting was so-so ,  most of the time it was believable ,  but i was able to see through it most of the time .  so .  .  .  without giving anything away ,  i must say that unless you like the actors in the film ,  there is no real reason to watch this movie .  i could be mistaken ,  but i just didn't understand why there was so little ,  or too much of the film .  i can't decide which one that would be ,  so i say judge for yourselves .  i don't even know if renting it would be a good idea ,  the cost and all .  .  .    plot :  0/10 characters :  1/10 acting :  2/10 overall :  3/10 i feel like that's too high really ,  i am staying with my vote up at the top .
-1	dick foran and peggy moran ,  who were so good together in the mummy's hand ,  return for this very minor universal horror offering .  but this time ,  instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick  " babe ,  "  we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named  " stuff "  .  but the results are nowhere near as charming ,  and the scare level is virtually nil .   dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle .  peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride .  but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as  " the phantom "  who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself .   this  " phantom "  is not very mysterious ,  and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness .  it's always nice to see perky moran ,  but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal's instantly forgettable misfires .
-1	a horribly pointless and ,  worse ,  boring film .  stranger than fiction has nothing new to say about anything ,  no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes ,  and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way .    will ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to jim carey's truman show ,  and substitutes his usual shouting routine  ( admittedly very funny if you discount talledega nights )  for ,  well ,  pretty much nothing .    emma thompson is no more than mildly irritating  ( that some reviews i've read here are talking her up for an oscar nomination is laughable )  whilst maggie gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy .  please .  that she ended up falling for ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous .   marc forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with .   i had the choice of either going to watch the prestige for the third time or seeing this .  i wish i'd opted for the prestige .
-1	stranger than fiction angered me so much ,  i signed up on imdb just to write this review .  stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex ,  touching and thought-provoking movie until the very end .  once you suspend multiple lapses of logic  ( why didn't will ferrell hear emma thompson's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book ?   " the phone rang .  the phone rang again .  "  how could she not know it's him calling ?  etc .  )  ,  the movie challenges one's thoughts about mortality ,  fate ,  and sacrifice .   the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english majors .  and maggie gyllenhaal is always a pleasure ,  even though will ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul .  her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith .   ah ,  but the ending .  until the very end ,  i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie .  the movie as a metaphor for life's journey ,  as a tribute to the notion of 'writing true , ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy ,  but not both ,  is outstanding .  the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will ferrell's fate .  and no matter how endearing a character he may have become ,  we know full well why we will accept the ending .  the last act occurs ,  the screen goes white ,  the credits roll .  a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film .  an end that would have been debated for weeks .   no !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  no credits rolled .  say it isn't so .  say hollywood didn't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie .  dustin hoffman got it right when he said ,   " it's no longer a masterpiece ;  it's ok .  "  an apt review of the movie .  except to me ,  it wasn't even ok .  i was so offended about the betrayal of 'writing true , ' about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie .  i don't often cry .  i could care less about most movies ,  but i am still angry about this one .   my questions for zack helm ,  the writer ,  are this :  did the original movie end when the screen went white ?  and were you forced by the vapid movie powers-that-be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie ?  or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ?  i've read you're brilliant .  i hope your original script ended the movie the first time .   i know zack helm will never see this review ,  and i've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself .  but ,  please ,  movie-goers ,  am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction ?  one good thing came from me seeing this movie :  i doubly admire lost in translation now .
-1	a badly-acted two-character comedy-drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren't-we-awful-to-the-indians polemic ,  with lousy special effects ,  exploitative use of nudity ,  and ugly violence .  it's as sincere as a politician's handshake ,  as obvious as a car salesman's pitch ,  one of the worst movies in the history of the universe .  absolute and utter dreck .
-1	**spoilers contained**  i'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific .  what i didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go .  what starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about honus  ( soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss )  and cresta  ( candice bergen )  who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne .  the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit .  donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason .  they then escape and both turn up  ( separately )  at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base .  as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them .  so far so ordinary .  then comes the ending .  after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline ,  the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head .  similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence .  in some ways ,  soldier blue reminds me of frank perry's last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending .  i didn't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending .  if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents ,  i would recommend elem klimov's come and see .
-1	soldier blue is a movie with pretensions :  pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man ,  on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples ;  a biting ,  unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam .  well ,  sorry ,  but it fails miserably to be any of those things .  what soldier blue actually is is pernicious ,  trite ,  badly made ,  dishonest rubbish .   another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies .  what it is basically is a lame ,  clichéd ,  poorly acted  " odd couple "  romance - strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love  ( ah ,  bless )  - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick .   there is no excuse for the repulsive ,  prurient ,  gore-drenched climax ,  in which cute little native american children are variously shot ,  sliced ,  dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up ,  and large-breasted native american women are molested ,  raped and strung up - no excuse ,  that is ,  except box office .   ( the massacre itself ,  whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention ,  is very badly staged and shot ;  a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them ,  intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments ,  incidentally ,  which utilised real amputees in their filming .  now that's what i call exploitation .  )   forget all the pap you've heard  ( including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie )  about this being a  " protest "  ,  an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples .  this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne ;  had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters ,  would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless ,  faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax .  instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss  ( lousy actors both ,  in this at least )  ,  with plenty of blood ,  guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious .   which is a terrible shame ,  because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre ,  about all of the real life massacres the us  ( and britain ,  and all so-called  " civilised "  nations )  have participated in over the centuries  ( iraq ?  )  .  this just isn't that movie .
-1	my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke .  little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it .  while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles .  these included :   1 )  drinking bleach 2 )  rubbing sand in my eyes 3 )  writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy 4 )  re-enacting the american civil war 5 )  tax returns 6 )  gcse maths 7 )  sex with an old lady .   garrett clancy ,  aka sgt .  ben draper wrote this ?  the guy couldn't even dig a hole properly .  the best ting he did was kick a door down  ( the best part of the film )  .  this was the worst film i have ever seen ,  and i've seen white noise :  the light .  never has a film had so many mistakes in it .  my girlfriend left it here ,  so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap .   news just in :  owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself .  fact .   do not watch
-1	first of all ,  this film can be divided into three segments .  a promising opening ,  with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne .  this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section ,  with the totally miscast candice bergen and  " soldier blue "  traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison .  miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth ,  and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s jack nicholson movie .  i mean she maintains zero interest ,  with zero believability .  the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village .  this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda ,  that it comes across as simply long ,  outrageous ,  and contrived .  not recommended .  - merk .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  jacobe  ( comment above )  here's an idea .  why don't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on ,  instead of chirping your liberal nonsense .  this is not a political site ,  it is for reviewing films .  - merk
-1	when sam peckinpah's superlative the wild bunch  ( 1969 )  opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence ,  it did so with a talented  ( if whisky-marinated )  hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth ,  but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah's epic ,  and soldier blue definitely falls into that category .   soldier blew ,  er ,  blue tells the story of foul-mouthed new yorker cresta lee  ( candice bergen )  a blonde proto-hippie chick who's been  " rescued "  from two years of  " captivity "  among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money .  also on board the wagon she's traveling in is a shipment of government gold ,  cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with ,  so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills ,  accompanied by honus gant  ( peter strauss )  ,  the lone surviving cavalryman .  calling gant by the snarky nickname  " soldier blue ,  "  cresta demonstrates that her years among the  " savages "  was time well spent ,  outstripping gant in survival skills ,  common sense ,  and sheer balls ,  and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements ,  a band of hostile kiowa ,  an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance ,  here giving one of his most ridiculous performances ,  and that's saying something  and ,  in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies ,  each other .   during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg ,  no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn't filled with rattlesnakes ,  mountain lions ,  or who knows what ,  to say nothing of the cheyenne ,  who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment  ( there i go ,  thinking in nyc real estate terms again )  .    realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave ,  cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant ;  the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village ,  and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what's coming .    what happens next is what gained the film its infamy ;  it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre ,  an orgy of rape ,  torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of  " keeping the country clean ,  "  and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty .  children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets ,  unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect ,  i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes ,  then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight ,  so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts ,  which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered ,  their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs .  no joke ,  this scene would instantly garner an nc-17 rating if released today ,  to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted .   i'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won ,  or stolen if truth be told ,  but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be ;  one minute it's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up  ( well ,  duh !  )  ,  then it's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho  ( with no undies )  ,  but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally  (  ?  )  hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere ,  all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax .  any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film ,  but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery .    but by trying to be all things to all audiences ,  soldier blue ends up as an incoherent ,  preachy mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness ,  but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre ,  wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece ?  we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing  " the most savage film in history .  "  if you ,  like me ,  were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its  " daring to tell it like it was ,  "  take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .
-1	beginning with the poster  ( featuring only morgan freeman and kevin spacey )  ,  the entire movie was a fraud .  one stereotype after another ,  this movie was about nothing - or nothing new ,  at least .  after 10-15 minutes ,  you realize that you've just paid to see justin timberlake and ll cool j recite their way through another cop-flick .   basically ,  the story is about the corrupt system in some city ,  all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town ,  under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician .  the almighty and above-the-law organization is called frat and guess what ?  they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects ,  girlfriends ,  you name it .  frat cops are corrupt and greedy ,  so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented  (  !  !  !  )  journalist .  one hour later ,  after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines ,  everything ends happily and we get served the final line  :  you can't beat the system .  bah !  don't see this waste of film roll .  freeman and spacey barely have 10 min altogether !
-1	other than the great cinematography by the marvelous james wong howe in the battle scenes ,  this film is a true stinker .   this is the second film that i've seen in recent days directed by alexander korda .  the first was charles laughton's  " rembrandt .  "  it was so lousy that i shut it off .  this one i'm afraid is not very much better .   flora robson is as ugly as ever as queen elizabeth .  perhaps ,  her performance as the virgin queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a helen mirren ,  it is absolutely no match .  in robotic fashion ,  robson states her lines .  her battle message to the english troops is so lackluster in spirit .   even a dashing laurence olivier can't save this utter piece of boredom .   future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really convey anything here .  to think ,  that scarlett was 2 years later !   it's a shame that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film .
-1	i remembered the title so well .  to me ,  it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles .  and it had vincent massey's voice from behind whiskers .  well flora robson was great .  her next signature ,  for me ,  would be  " 55 days at peking "  .  the same role but with different sumptuous gowns .  and the same voice .  as for the armada ,  it was a subtext .  i like black-and-white films .  was everything done in elizbethan times at night ?  it was talky and difficult to fathom ,  at times .  i couldn't tell which was the love interest .  was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh ?  and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada .  apparently it worked for the empire ,  but not for the script .  this might have been more accurate ,  historically ,  but bette davis had more engaging scripts .  and i missed daylight !
-1	spoilers   well ,  the one line summary says it all .  melville´s  " le samurai "  is the original and there are elements of  " leon "  .  and they are better - much better !   in the  " samurai "  alain delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs  ( with so much suspense in these scenes !  )  .  even the end is exactly the same :  the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand .  the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it .   delon is not killing so many people like the ghost dog .  but i guess jarmusch liked  " leon "  very much or even  " desperado "  by rodriguez .  so he added this ,  too .  and let me guess :  the girl will become a professional like ghost dog  ( like natalie portman in  " leon "  )  ?   so what was jarmusch thinking after all ?  where is the unique ,  the original thought in this movie ?   i can´t see the point in making carbon  ( celluloid )  copies .   a 4/10 rating by macaulay connor
-1	now i'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair ,  so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie .   that about sums it up too .  i disliked this movie .  to be more specific ,  i disliked the concept of this movie .  the cinematography was good .  the mood was nice .  and the acting was satisfactory .    however ,  the story is fatuous ,  unacurate and misleading .  it is also offensive .   i am a quarter cree indian ,  and for some reason i feel insulted ,  on a personal level ,  by the nature of whitaker's character .  first of all ,  he's a black guy .  and this isn't a racist remark ,  i swear .  the thought of a white ,  hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents .  the katana represents the soul of a samurai ,  imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai .  for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside ,  and where the heck did he get a katana anyway ?  it must be one of those replicas ,  which insults the samurai caste even more .   also ,  ghost dog showed no honor .  near the end of the movie ,  he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain .  not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy ,  it's more like a ninjas way ;  silent assassins ;  a group that samurais deny exists ,  but hates none-the-less .   then he tries to kill his boss ,  when he finds out his boss is a baddie .  you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable ?  he kills himself ,  to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master .   everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to :  bushido .   so ,  we have great cinematography ,  good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise ,   ( which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it )   ,  making it an unsatisfactory overall film ,  and an insult to everything a honorable bushi ( samurai )  holds dear .    2 . 5/10 bleah
-1	" don't bother to watch this film "  would be better advice ,  if you like marilyn monroe in her other roles .  this was a huge disappointment considering the great cast ,  not just marilyn .   the story was just nothing ,  certainly nothing like described on the vhs box ,  of course .  there simply was no suspense ,  precious little excitement and too many dull spots ,  most of them trying to show why  " nellie "   ( monroe )  was so messed up .  this was not a good role for monroe ,  even though i didn't need to see this character to know she could act .   " some like it hot "  alone was good enough evidence for me .  but this role just didn't fit her and it's no surprise it wasn't one of her more popular films .   it's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like richard widmark ,  anne bancroft ,  elisha cook jr .  ,  jeanne cagney ,  donna cocoran and others .    summary :  it's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .
-1	this is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose ,  then sets about  " taming "  his reluctant bride .  it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time .  we never find out ,  for example ,  why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband .  or why the members of her team are so eager to get a  " real man "  in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own .  this only made sense in fifties hollywood .   there's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse .  never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye ,  which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip !  then ,  he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp .  that's some second wind .  later ,  he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians  ( as they all are in these flicks )  after they reject her now she's his  " squaw "  .  never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years .  and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah ,  right .  like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail .   finally ,  neither of the leads is convincing in their roles .  madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky .  fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot ,  but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy .  the only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end .  the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls .  even if you do see them as dolls ,  the total lack of suspense will bore you .   total waste of time .  even the scenery's kinda dull .  give this one a big miss .
-1	to be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it ,  but i'm never one to let others influence my viewings ,  in fact i'm more likely to watch something out of defiance !  .  bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway ,  the fact that rhonda fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away .  the picture isn't very good ,  and is in fact very morally dubious ,  all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form ,  all motivated by greed or egocentric victories ,  this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture .  sadly it doesn't ,  and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you can't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film ,  nobody in the cast come out with any credit ,  with lead man guy madison painfully wooden in the extreme .   not even the lovely rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone ,  3/10
-1	i'm basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night  ( 9/27/06 )  .  i don't think i'll be watching again .  the acting was totally wooden ,  the plot completely predictable ,  the ending totally unrealistic -- i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer ?  the lead actor  ( victor garber )  seemed so uncomfortable ,  almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was !  !  i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor ,  but they can surely find better writers .  maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china !  !  i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season !
-1	happened upon a copy of this .  not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back !  all i can say is this would be a terrible student film .  any understanding of the medium of film is absent .  acting is god awful ,  the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame ,  and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to the 'ghost' is laughable .   i can only agree that the 'glowing' reviews of this film are from friends and family .  i'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad .   amateur in the extreme !    avoid !  avoid !  avoid !
-1	frankly i'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering .  have they all been written by his pals ?  the action clunks along ,  the music is irritating and over used ,  the script is simply dire and the actors  ( with the exception of the gardener )  mediocre at best .  i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i . e .  continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture .  yes ,  it's his first film ,  low budget etc .  - i get it ,  but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch .
-1	it's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny ,  the script is absolutely dire ,  direction appalling ,  lighting purely armature ,  the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad ;  it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard ,  but doesn't at least destroy any speeches .  there's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout .  and finally last but not least the acting is appalling .  for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this .
-1	when thinking about captivity many words come to mind .  among them are :  uninteresting ,  unentertaining ,  unsuspensful ,  unsexy ,  unfathomable ,  and unwatchable .   i used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of scream but these new saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics .  they still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing ,  but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they're aimed at feel like they're hardcore and hip .   this movie is a load of boring crap !  what the hell has happened to larry cohen ?  his name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993 !  even so ,  i was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something this bad !  was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths ?  did anyone not know it when they first saw him ?  only someone who has never before in his or her life ,  ever seen another movie !
-1	ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected !  he did a fabulous job acting as a  " renegade "  cop within a  " renegade "  department .  from the very beginning ,  he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in .  he acts as a sort of  " gentle giant "  -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody ,  yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job .  he was quite clearly the best character in the movie .   this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards .  after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down .  his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner .  there are so many ways his character  ( moses ashford )  could have taken a more pivotal role .  that he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down .  i was hoping to see more from him in this film .   timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry .  his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive .  this movie is a typical action movie that  ( at least initially )  bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past .  being an action movie ,  it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes ,  blood ,  and guts .  these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable .  watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot-out .   what irked me most was the way timberlake's character behaved during shoot-out scenes .  he starts out having guns and not using them .  then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life .  then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later ,  without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo ?  !  little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me .   if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay ,  then you'll probably love this movie .  personally ,  it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic .  make me believe that the story is true .  this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied .
-1	i'll keep this short ;  thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly :  captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink ,  imprisons and tortures her ,  then poses as a captive to have sex with her .  that is the single twist and punchline of the film .  it's torture as slow motion date rape .  and ,  it's not even a good movie .  it's not so bad it's good ;  it's just bad .   it should also be mentioned that among critics ,  there is a  " spoiler code "  that they dare not break ,  even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile .  why no one had the cojones to step up and say ,   " this is garbage ,  and this is why ,  "  is beyond me .   don't give your money to these poop-peddlers .
-1	the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on .   this film is asinine .  it's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder .  the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting .  i didn't care about any of the characters ,  but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap :  i'd complain about the money i spent ,  but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining  " live free or die hard ,  "  which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of  " captivity "  for 40 minutes .
-1	absolutely fantastic .    now ,  before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés ,  allow me to elaborate .  much as i enjoyed it ,  this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema  ( an impressive claim ,  as i remember seeing daredevil on the big screen )  .  the two leads  ( daniel gillies and elisha cuthbert )  were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst .  of course ,  they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne & celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the oj defence .  the plot  ( to stretch the term slightly )  was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes ,  whilst undoubtedly brutal ,  were irrelevant and laughably formulaic .  what plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model  ( cuthbert )  who is abducted ,  imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures ,  both psychological and physical .  the torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience .  whilst there really are very ,  very few positives to draw from this film ,  its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film .  i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema .  within twenty minutes ,  the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout .  for my part i came out flushed with laughter ,  buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making .  whichever way you look at it ,  this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film .   p . s .  i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free .  .  . so i can afford to laugh about it .  i was still tempted to ask for my money back .  .  . it really was that bad .
-1	the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor ,  a holocaust survivor ,  part of mengele's experiments on twins ,  consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz ,  and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments .  the movie obviously had great reviews .  it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about .   i too ,  for a large part of the movie ,  got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on .  one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder  ( obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum )  could only find the sweetest nectar .   " in one of the many dramatic sequences ,  as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center ,  the meaning of the word  " forgive "  is even debated ,  but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own "  but by this time ,  the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more .  after the  " strong-willed "  eva kor forgives her  " nazi captors "  the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about ,  at least from the viewpoint of kor .  the movie goes about following her ,  past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory .  to me ,  this was the meat of the movie ,  surrounded by inedible fat of her  " act of forgiveness "  .  obviously ,  it was a very sick cow .   on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness ,  in order to heal wounds of the past ,  she makes her way to the  " promised land "  to meet with some arabs ,  to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis ,  including one at a jewish center in chicago .  from then on ,  anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements .   firstly ,  you immediately notice her body language ,  defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers .  her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time ,  effort and money the entire act was .  a rather annoyed dr sami advan  ( professor of education at bethlehem university )  gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment .   finally ,  the debate at the jewish center in chicago ,  where she is  " grilled "  on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so ,  in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts .   i will cut to the chase .  by the end of the movie ,  i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie .  the movie was badly made ,  failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial ,  just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears .  it showed that kor ,  the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion .  her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness  ( at best )  to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate .   lastly ,  is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving ?  quoting another imdb user ,   " i don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary ,  she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul ,  she wanted the suffering to be over ,  so she let it go .  "  that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace .   i guess ,  in a world of propaganda ,  blind faith and political correctness ,  there is no room to question those that have  " gone through more than the human mind can fathom "  .   p . s .  the dictionary certainly should go into all those books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making .
-1	this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning ,  but never fleshed out to it's expectations .  the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  ( typical of the asian directors )  ,  but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it .  the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film ,  never finding a solid ,  explainable ,  interesting angle .  basically ,  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases .  the acting was very good ,  however .  all the actors gave good performances ,  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is .  it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .
-1	jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value .  completely lacking in eroticism ,  excitement ,  or leading ladies with appeal .  one decent fight ,  a few moments of mild suspense .  and a one-note plot .   the movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between law's character and a dogged homicide detective ,  well played by timothy spall .  but despite their best efforts ,  both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality .   with a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of oliver curtis's cinematography -- crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies .
-1	i love all types of films ,  especially horror .  that being said ,  survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it .   i can't give it any points on originality .  there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes ,  or remaking what others have done .  it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods ,  a crazed killer ,  and as of lately ,  throw in some crazy family .  on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw ,  wrong turn  ( though the twist in that one is obvious )  ,  and others .  survival falls up way short against comparable films .  the plot was just not original in any way .  some films can get by with a weak  ( and way over-done )  plot with superb acting ,  special fx ,  or a slew of other factors .  survivial doesn't have any of that to bank on .  if you will ,  note the following :  the acting in the movie never took off .  i don't knock or blame the actors for that ,  nor the director .  the dialogue was at best mediocre ,  and the actors involved never showed  ( not saying didn't have )  the talent to pull it off .  i mention 2 standouts .  the leading man in this film certainly has the look ,  but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film .  the actor who portrayed greg also had potential ,  but we never got to see any of it  ( watch the movie to see why ,  you won't believe it .  .  )  .   the grainy film look .  ah yes ,  that little tid-bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of  " grindhouse "  films .  in today's film making ,  that has become a gimmick .  it either works or it doesn't .  in this case it just does not work .  there are too many other flaws going on ,  so it winds up distracting from the film ,  not adding to it .  that being said ,  i think they did a good job of adding that grain .  that is some good ,  quality grain .  i think with a different script ,  better direction ,  and possibly actors ,  they should try another  " grindhouse "  attempt .  they will probably pull it off .   as far as the tech aspects ,  in my opinion ,  they never quite gelled for me either .  better care could have been taken with audio  ( sounds like it was fed directly into the camera ,  but there is nothing wrong with that )  and for being shot on dv ,  it was too soft for my taste .   that is all i have to say about that .  .  .  .  .
-1	this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness .   i don't even have the vocabulary to say how dire ,  turgid ,  boring ,  confusing ,  and just plain strange this effort is  ( hey what d'ya know i do .  .  .  .  )  set in a post-apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue - it was all so incomprehensible i couldn't make head or tail of any of it .   seriously how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me :  it really is awful .   and not in a its so bad it's good cult way .   it is just awful ,  awful ,  awful ,  awful .   honestly .  if you still don't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think .  even gerbils on acid couldn't hope to understand this .   avoid or even better destroy .  .  .
-1	i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations .  the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good ,  right ?  how wrong i was .    i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey  ( a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah )  .  .  .  well the director/writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man ,  because i cannot see how he  ( along with the other actors in the film )  would ever agree to be in this disaster .    this movie is absolutely appalling !  it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever .  there is nothing new with edison .  the acting was bad and the direction was even worse .  it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy .  this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen .    some examples of just bad silly moments in edison .  .  .  morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music .  .  .  justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles .  .  .  llcoolj driving a vintage firebird .  .  .  3 guys being shot in the head .  .  .   this movie is the opposite of good .   stay away from edison !
-1	this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together .  well there's nothing wrong with that ,  except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together .  90 percent of the cast are white males about same age .  it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves .  the movie has no plot .  it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath .  there are some funny scenes and comedic bits .  but they don't redeem the flat monotony .   the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do ,  and not done very well at that .  anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation .   i went to see this film after seeing the trailer ,  which makes it look like a tarrentino piece .  well ,  the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get .  ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane ,  inane comedy .  it works at times ,  but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over .  it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie .  it's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy .  i can see where the story idea is intriguing .  but ,  in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england .  in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era .  he plans to make a part 2 .  i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing .   at the opening in la ,  wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 .  he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one ,  to which he replied ,  well yea ,  sure .
-1	this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched .  do not rent !  the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie .  it starts with some what of a plot ,  then fades fast to nothing .  i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover .  the actors were awful ,  the plot faded fast ,  filming left to much work to be done .  not one good thing to say about this crap movie .  if you rent this movie you will waste your money .  i really enjoy national lampoon movies ,  but this was a waste of time .  learn to write ,  learn to act ,  learn to produce ,  and learn to direct .  i feel i should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost .
-1	i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word ,  there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j .  fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills !  #2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time i'd be fired on the spot !  the organization to which i belong  ( les clefs d'or )  has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously .  #3 similarly untrue was the concept ,  at the end of the movie ,  of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them .  there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization .   this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary .  in short it does a disservice to our organization .  i welcome any comments .
-1	i expected alot from this movie .  kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie .  i can't even explain this movie .  it had wooden acting ,  terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes ,  tidal waves and earthquakes .  but that was at the end !  the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't .  this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest .  the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings .  the whole movie is missleading and boring .  one of lees worst .
-1	end of the world is an uneventful movie ,  which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth .  the main character is some kind of scientist ,  i'm not exactly sure what kind .  he has two jobs at a government (  ?  )  facility guarded by four security men .  his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space  ( although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job #2 )  .  job #2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room .  .  . at least that's the best i can figure .  apparently the  " plant "  is not exactly top-secret ,  as the scientist brings his wife there .  she hangs out  ( they're on their way to a dinner )  while he discovers a message from space :  major earth disruption ,  repeated over and over .  he says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher ;  his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party .  so they leave and go to the party  (  !  ?  !  )  .  moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake .  from there ,  the movie goes .  .  .  nowhere !  yes ,  christopher lee is in it ,  but that really doesn't help much .  besides ,  lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii .  this movie is boring ,  but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z-grade sci-fi .  plus ,  there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .
-1	this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen ,  its horrible .  christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it ,  the only the good part is the opening scene .   don't be fooled by the title .   " end of the world "  is truly a bad movie ,  i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad ,  only for die hard b-movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit .
-1	end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad . being a big fan of mega star actor christopher lee i was fooled .  like tentacles ( 77 ) a good cast does not mean it'll be a good film . the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium , many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on . the rest of the cast is shown briefly like ; lew ayres , dean jagger , and macdonald carey as a security guard . i would expect better from charles band who made good fun movies like the re-animater and dolls . i heard christopher lee was tricked into making this film . he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer , john carridine , and dean jagger . well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it ( lucky them ) if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline . dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards ; alligator ( 80 ) and game of death ( 79 )  sue lyon ( lolita ) is also in the movie minus her lollipop . if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie . 1 out of 10 .
-1	what can i say about this film other than  " don't see it "  .  i waited and waited and waited for someting  ( or anything )  to happen and it just didn't come .  watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie .  what are they doing ?  are they solving a mystery ?  are they gathering clues ?  possibly ,  it's just hard to tell .  at the end of the movie ,  after a lot of radio signals are decoded  ( illegibly on some sort of pet monitor )  and this guy gives some lectures ,  the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible .  some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth  ( i guess they don't like sharing the wealth )  .  my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art  ( garbage !  )  and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film .  watch at your own peril ,  it's not even funny because it's so bad ,  it's just bad .
-1	dull ,  cheap sci-fi thriller ,  made with an almost total lack of conviction  ( a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man ,  and is very poorly guarded at night )  ,  and full of campy sound effects .  christopher lee is not only wasted ,  but he also gives one of his few  " i'm here strictly for the money "  performances .   ( *1/2 )
-1	a good deal of running around .  a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity .  a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them ,  gets caught up with aliens .  along with his pretty wife ,  he invades their territory and is given secrets about them .  he becomes rather traitorous in the process .  granted ,  he is given little choice anyway .  there is a scene where he gives them everything they want .  this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens .  the plot isn't technically bad .  it's just that we are usually following a car ,  a trip through a woods ,  investigating a building .  this is what editing is all about .  i suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more .  not much here .
-1	" a scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters ,  occurring across the globe .  hoping to discover the source of these signals and who's behind them ,  the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals .  what the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be ,  "  according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis .   kirk scott  ( as andrew boran )  is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer .  he suspects a series of  " large earth disruptions "  may be connected to the weird space static .  mr .  scott and pretty blonde wife sue lyon  ( as sylvia boran )  investigate the mysterious signals from outer space .  they discover priestly ,  but creepy christopher lee  ( as  " father pergado "  )  ,  and other silliness .  given that ,   " end of the world "  is remarkably dull .    *** end of the world  ( 1977 )  john hayes ~ kirk scott ,  sue lyon ,  christopher lee
-1	that is the only question i am left with .  why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast ?  why was the writing so bad ,  it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters ?  why did it not make any sense at all ?  why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and  " hollywood "  the hell out of it when all it needed was good ,  smart story telling ?  why ?  i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released .  i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey ,  who are oscar winners ,  that this never is released to the big screens in america .   as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism ,  the whole story is just utterly laughable .  i just .  .  . think the script had potential ,  but the execution turned it into a cliché ,  and an awful one at that .  just .  no .
-1	christopher lee is one of my favorite actors !  i'm trying to view all of his work .  he has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence .  unfortunately ,  this is not one of them .  this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing .  please .  .  . for the love of christopher .  .  .  . avoid this film !
-1	spoilers  wow ,  end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience .   here is the full story :  a scientist is getting messages from space  ( a la independence day )  .  the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china .  he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages  ( and who's also sending out messages in space )  .  he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent .  they visit it .  everything looks normal ,  including the priest played by a bored christopher lee .  but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent .  so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens ,  disguised as priests and nuns .  they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet .  once the alien get the special element ,  the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform .  lee ,  being the last alien left ,  tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens .  lee walks in the transporter and he's gone .  the couple ,  looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world ,  decide to follow the aliens .  because earth is doomed ,  the couple doesn't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear .  the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding .  the end .   that's it .    i've never seen such a dull movie in my life .  it's the most underwhelming movie i've ever experienced .  the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen .  they don't care about anything .  they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide  " what the heck ,  who needs earth anyway ?  "  they don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better .  this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent .  the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces ,  so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work .  i wasn't expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production ,  but i didn't expect it to be this bad .   christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions .  well ,  i'm sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun .  starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining .  end of the world is much ,  much ,  much worst :  it's beyond dull and inert ,  with no entertainment value whatsoever .
-1	it's got christopher lee ,  it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen ,  it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises ,  it's got volcanoes !  evil aliens disguised as nuns !  tidal waves !  earthquakes !  exploding cars !  exploding coffee machines !  and as a climax the entire planet blows up .  how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly ,  mind-numbingly dull ?  the answer ,  my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots ,  most of them involving long tracks ,  pans ,  or zooms in combinations ,  or occasionally all three ,  that do nothing except give the crew something to do .  there are endless shots of our protagonists driving ,  getting in and out of cars ,  driving again ,  walking around looking at stuff ,  getting in cars and driving .  .  .  i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering  " say something ,  please somebody ,  just say something .  .  .  do something .  .  .  anything !  .  .  .  "   the dialogue ,  when it does come ,  is terrible .    " maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours .  "  was a typically meaningless line .  the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage ,  justified in this speech from lee as the head alien :    " the planet earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases ,  they are contaminating the universe .  all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed !  "    this is is neanderthal sf script writing .  this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds .  it is ,  and i collect such things ,  the most god-awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired .  it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters .   lee ,  who always struck me as a smart ,  useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits ,  delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek .  i don't blame him .
-1	your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller ;  but ,  pray ,  who's will ?  a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people .   small _apocalyptically themed outing ,  end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies .  and it's not only that ,  but eotw plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well .  the villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor .   this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation ,  that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated .  anyway ,  the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco !  christopher lee is the pride of end of the world ;  but the end of the world is not at all his pride !
-1	this film had a great cast going for it :  christopher lee ,  dean jagger ,  macdonald carey ,  lew ayres -- solid b-movie actors all .  but this downer of a movie didn't use any of them to any sort of advantage ,  with none of their characters even meeting on screen  ( though christopher lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes )  .   the motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat .  first ,  they just want to repair their ship and leave ,  then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need .  then ,  out of nowhere ,  this  " peaceful "  race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many  " diseases "   ( though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society )  .   most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing .  you almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end ,  just in vengeance for boring us to death .   unless you really like chris lee or seventies low-budget sci-fi ,  i'd give this one a miss .  it falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between star odyssey and ufo :  target earth .
-1	the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns .  christopher lee  ( who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved )  is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine .  the cast are not too bad ,  though most have now retired from acting .  the film has terrible sound effects  ( mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems )  and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky ,  for instance ,  for what feels like hours at a time .  despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate .  interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie ;  meda band ;  writer frank ray perilli and charles band's assistant bennah burton .  despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .
-1	i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial .  the commercial was great ,  but it i found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie  ( about 4 )  and even some that weren't in the movie .  there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember .  it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people .  i guess my world of innocence ended that day ,  when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .
-1	this movie was terrible ! i rented it not knowing what to expect . i watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb . the acting was bad and there was no plot . the monster is soooooo fake . it growls and its mouth doesnt move . also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster . just plain bad don't even waste your time .  ( 1 out of 10 )
-1	wow ,  i just saw this on t . v .  as one of the  " scary "  movies they show around halloween .  was this rated g ?  there wasn't really anything to make this movie scary ,  or worth watching .  also ,  other people say this is a spoof ,  but i don't think so .  for a spoof ,  you need something called  " humor "  .  this low-budget crap-fest didn't have a shred of humor ,  and it didn't make much sense ,  either .  you basically have a goofy looking monster  ( man in rubber suit )  coming out of closets ,  killing people ,  i guess ,  since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath .  the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster ,  so i guess that's good enough .   the military tries feebly to kill the monster ,  which isn't much larger than a man .  they have very bad aim .  then the military flees !  wow ,  did this movie make the u . s .  military look pathetic or what ?  the monster ,  while hard to kill ,  doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar .  oh ,  and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks .  it was a slightly interesting ,  yet a total alien ripoff .   what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster ?  it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality .  also ,  why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ?  why didn't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance ?  why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ?
-1	now ,  i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash .  .  .   i appreciate the fact it's a spoof ,  but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing ,  acting and dialogue .  seriously ,  this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen - it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper ,  and a poor one at that .  .  .   okay - a few criticisms  ( 1 )  when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster  ( we never see the monster attack him ,  so we assume its a heart attack )  ,  the army then launch shells ,  rockets ,  bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive  ( 2 )  the army attack from about 100 yards away ,  and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez ,  those things have a range of no more than 30 metres !   ( 3 )  when the monster tries to take the professor ,  the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling ;  the monster drops the kid ,  and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster ?  ?  ?  come on !   ( 4 )  the monster looks like it something out of power rangers !   ( 5 )  there is one scene where the five  " good guys "   ( the priest ,  the girl ,  the doctor ,  the reporter and the kid )  all look shocked and we get reactions  ( along the lines of hand to mouth )  one after the other - so natural !   ( 6 )  the general just runs away ,  time after time  ( 7 )  the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen  ( 8 )  the acting is awful  ( 9 )  did i mention the rubber suit monster ?  ?  ?  ?   ( 10 )  that god-awful music ,  non-stop !
-1	yes ,  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro .  it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature ,  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond .  add in harry andrews  ( with a strange accent ,  no less )  chasing an ostrich ,  tons of stock footage of wildlife ,  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard ,  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .
-1	wow .  i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast .  justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had .   his acting was painful to observe .  the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors ,  heck ,  even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on .  how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend .   his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass ,  and he is supposed to be the hero .  .  .  i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video .  maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at 2am on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned ,  this may be ok .   watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'kermit the frog' act in a hollywood blockbuster ,  just didn't work at all .
-1	the head of a common new york family ,  jane gail  ( as mary barton )  ,  works with her younger sister ethel grandin  ( as loma barton )  at  " smyrner's candy store "  .  after ms .  grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves ,  ms .  gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore  ( as larry burke )  must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman .    " traffic in souls "  has a reputation that is difficult to support - it isn't remarkably well done ,  and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's  " virtue "  threatened by sex traders .  perhaps ,  it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length  ( claimed to have been ten reels ,  originally )  .  the new york city location scenes are the main attraction ,  after all these years .  the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable ,  because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move .    **** traffic in souls  ( 11/24/13 )  george loane tucker ~ jane gail ,  matt moore ,  ethel grandin
-1	kirstie alley ,  looking a bit slimmer ,  but only a bit ,  is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike ,  bleached blond hair and all .  the premise of the movie is about an older woman  ( 50 !  !  !  )  who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer .  not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting ,  inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot .  there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery .  the actor who portrays kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast ,  it was torture to watch their scenes .  what is there to say about this film .  avoid it .
-1	1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 ( dir-jon keeyes )  :  over-the-top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like friday the 13th ( versions 1 thru whatever )  .  i can't think of much redeeming here except ( or can i think of anything ?  ) the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this ,  supposedly .  but ,  lo and behold ,  one of the stupid people ,  have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered ( again ,  how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this )  .  guess what ?  the murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is ( so there goes any mystery whatsoever )  .  and besides all this ,  where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them .  i can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made .  you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher ,  at least in their movie-going experience ,  but not so by this filmmaker .
-1	this piece ain't really worth a comment .  .  it's simply the worst  " horror "  movie i have ever seen .  the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry .  shame on you i say !  !
-1	without a doubt this is one of the worst films i've ever wasted money on !  the plot is ,  erm sorry ,  did i say there was a plot ?  the scariest moment was when .  .  .  ,  nope can't think of one !  the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was .  .  .  ,  nope can't think of one for that either .  you knew who the killer was right from the start .  there was nothing scary about the whole movie ,  in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister ,  misty ,  in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off .  this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie !  !  !
-1	this movie is outrageous .  by outrageous ,  i mean awful .  i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke .  the acting got progressively worse as the  " movie "  advanced ,  and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached .  when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem .  that was not intelligent .  truthfully ,  stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed .  if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie ,  bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends .
-1	" american nightmare "  is officially tied ,  in my opinion ,  with  " it's pat !  "  for the worst movie of all time .   seven friends  ( oddly resembling the k-mart version of the cast of  " friends "  )  gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare ,  a pirate radio show .  it's hosted by a guy with a beard .  that's the most exciting aspect of his show .   chandler ,  monica ,  joey ,  and .  .  .  oh wait ,  i mean ,  wayne ,  jessie ,  and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj .  unbeknownst to them ,  a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening .  .  .   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and .  .  .  wait ,  sorry again .  .  .  by making their fears come to life .  these fears include such stunners as  " voodoo "  and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures .   no .  really .   this movie was ,  in a word ,  rotten .  crazy nurse's killing spree lacks motivation ,  there's nothing to make the viewer  " jump ,  "  the ending blows ,  and--again--voodoo ?   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones ,  rent  " american nightmare "  with them .   if you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local blockbuster ,  rent all of the copies of  " american nightmare "  and hide them in your freezer .
-1	this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen .  the acting was terrible ,  horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot !  i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone .  what a waste of time !  first ,  as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into .  all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie .  the prank phone calls ,  halloween night ,  a psycho ,  and one knife !  its absolutely ridiculous .  i was not scared at all during the movie ,  which i thought horror movies were supposed to do .  as for the making of the movie ,  its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary .  i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of  " scary movie "  for example .  at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie .
-1	normally ,  i have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but i was so disappointed with this movie that i spent an hour registering with imdb just to get it off my chest .   you would think a movie with names like morgan freeman or kevin spacey would be a bankable bet .  .  .  well ,  this movie was just terrible .  it is nigh on impossible to  " suspend disbelief "  ;  i tried ,  really ,  i wanted to enjoy it but justin timberlake just wouldn't let me .    timberlake should stick to music ,  what a dreadful performance - no presence as an actor , no character .  can't blame everything on justin :  the movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing ;  its definitely an  " f "  .   after seeing this ,  i have to wonder what really motivates actors .  i mean ,  surely morgan actually read the script before taking the part .  did he not see how poor it was ?  what then could motivate him to take the part ?  money ?  of course ,  acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work .    ll cool j is a great actor ;  he gets a lot more screen time than freeman or spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script .    meanwhile ,  the audience goes :   " what the hell is going on here ?  you expect me to believe this crap ?  "   in short ,  apart from justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing .
-1	when i read the back of the dvd case ,  i thought that it sounded really interesting .  .  .  so .  .  .  i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the  " 4 for 20 dollars "  section at blockbuster .  when we got home and popped in the movie .  .  .  twenty minutes into it ,  we found ourselves turning to each other going  " this sucks .  let's put in something else .  "  i'll admit ,  a few of the lines from the friends at the café made us smile a little bit .  but come on ,  at least get some decent actors !  every once in a while in a movie ,  if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting ,  i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over ( or under ) doing their lines .  but i can only take so much .  crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter ,  there was no delivery for their lines .  .  .  amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film .   anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie .  it's the most pointless thing i've ever had the displeasure of watching .  do not watch or buy this movie !  !  !  !  !
-1	when it comes to horror movies ,  i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ,  ignore sub-par production values ,  and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare .  this movies simply has no good scares to offer .  it can't even be enjoyed as camp .  bad dialogue ,  bad acting ,  bad direction ,  the kills were predictable and poorly staged ,  the music was annoying ,  the camera work was wretched ,  even the costumes were bad .  i felt really bad for the actors ,  who were obviously trying ,  but who had to deal with terrible ,  contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction .  i doubt they got any rehearsal ,  either .  it's embarrassing to watch ,  and so boring than making it through to the contrived  " surprise "  ending requires tremendous endurance .  it's quite easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen .   i don't normally write reviews ,  but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others .  this movie is a complete waste of time .  if you must watch this movie ,  don't miss the  " making of " -featurette .  the writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold ,  daring move .   ( seen it .  )  he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new-age  " citizen kane .  "  it's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant .  they truly think they've created something of substance .  it's sad ,  really the only reason i gave this movie a  " 2 "  is because i think  " 1 "  should be reserved for true atrocities ,  like  " manos :  hands of fate "  and  " space mutiny .  "  so  " american nightmare "  isn't the worst movie i've ever seen ,  but i'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty .
-1	in texas ,  seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party .  meanwhile ,  they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears .  a serial killer ,  who is listening to their confessions ,  makes their nightmares come true ,  killing each one of them in a sadistic way .   " american nightmare "  is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning :  without any previous explanation ,  a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area ,  as if it were friday ,  13th .  then ,  the story shifts to a bar ,  where seven friends are celebrating halloween .  from this moment on ,  the story has a great potential ,  and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance ,  showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies ,  as usual in this type of c production .  however ,  the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan ,  giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting .  with a better beginning and conclusion ,  this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie .  my vote is four .   title  ( brazil )  :   " agonia "   (  " agony "  )
-1	the premise is amazing and the some of the acting ,  notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp ,  is charming .  .  .  but this film is near unwatchable .  the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap .  most of the singing is off-key .  i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it .  .  .  the dialogue is really stupid and trite .  the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots .  i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end . '
-1	so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film ,  and you might be thinking to yourself ,   " huh .  there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30 .  "  funny thing is ,  most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person ,  or at best a small ,  coordinated group of  " open house "  groupies .  the truth ,  my friends ,  is that this film is truly unwatchable .  just because it's  " independent "  doesn't mean it gets a free pass .  if you're going to make a musical ,  whether on film or on stage ,  whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse ,  you should probably make sure that  ( a .  )  your actors can sing ,   ( b .  )  your actors can dance ,   ( c .  )  you have decent sound equipment ,   ( d .  )  you have a well-written score ,  and  ( e .  )  you have lyrics that are witty and charming .  even anthony rapp can't save this one .  it's one of those unfortunate movie-going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved .
-1	i feel totally ripped off .  someone needs to refund the $4 . 95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess .  this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening .  what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place ?  ?  ?  .  .  . somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made .  i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact .  the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view .  .  . shot on dv ?  ?  ?  nuff said .  the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section .  want to see a good musical ?  then don't rent this movie .
-1	the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater .  i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 ,  and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival .  it was an interesting premise ,  and seemed like it could go somewhere ,  but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything .  first of all ,  if you're going to do a musical ,  find someone with musical talent .  the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming .  the lyrics were terribly written ,  and when they weren't obvious rhymes ,  they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work .  and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical ,  right ?  not in this case .  luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time ,  but when they did sing it made me cringe .  especially when they attempted to sing in harmony .  and that just addresses the music .  some of the acting was pretty good ,  but a lot of the dialog was terrible ,  as well as most of the scenes .  they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes ,  or they just had a bad editor ,  because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film .  at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical .  i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again .
-1	this movie was so terrible it was almost good .  .  .  almost .  we love musicals ,  but not this one .  even with the terrible sound quality ,  poor cinematography ,  and many actors who can't sing or dance ,  anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance  ( especially toward the end )  .  the character marjorie ,  a drunk lady ,  was enjoyable to watch ,  too .    the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music .  admittadly ,  some of the songs  ( fantabulous )  are pretty catchy  ( but not in a good way )  .   open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful !  we think it might be a good stage musical  ( with excellent actors )  .
-1	did heidijean really see this movie ?  a great christmas movie ?  not even close .  dull ,  bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart .  i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie !  the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance .  baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing .  probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with .  maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie .
-1	carly pope plays jj ,  a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant ,  overbearing mother moves in with her .  jj ,  aghast at this turn of events ,  then blackmails restaurant owner ,  alex ,  to entertain her mother in exchange for  " maybe "  reviewing his dying restaurant .  alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother .  there are numerous problems with this movie ,  the characters are universally 2-dimensional .  jj is a self-serving ,  hateful character ,  her mother superficial and shallow .  jj's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic .  the underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own ,  without male assistance is bad ,  bad ,  bad .  the acting is uniformly dull ,  the script uninspired .  the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city .  i would so not recommend this film .
-1	i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie ,  but neither was i expecting it to be so awful .  i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel .  i turned it back ,  hoping it was just one part of the movie ,  but no .  and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed ,  or almost done out of a job ,  or driven to madness inside her own home ?  are you kidding me ?  i was raised to respect  ( and even fear )  my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house .  i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house ,  after all .   i didn't buy any of it .  i tried giving it several chances ,  i really did .  sorry .
-1	i hate to sound like an 'old person' ,  but frankly i haven't seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 .  .  .  generally ,  movies just seem to get worse and worse  ( although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle  " the bread ,  my sweet "  ,  except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie )  .  this movie makes the mother ,  a former las vegas chorus girl ,  seem to be incapable of surviving on her own ,  although she is clearly in her 50s  ( though hinted at being in her 40s )  .  i didn't buy it .  i'm 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s ,  more than capable of surviving on my own  ( as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13 ,  got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey .  )    the daughter is not believable in her job role  .  .  .  she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve  ( a great opportunity )  and drops that ball too ,  but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver ,  the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist' ,  when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker ,  a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises  ( to her boss ,  in this case )  .   the daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her ,  on a temporary basis ,  but then treats her mother  ( the woman who gave her life and raised her to 'adulthood' )  like a pariah .  apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is not 'the common thing' for parents to act like children ,  and then be treated as children by their children .  that is just more of the societal 'baloney' that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we ,  their public ,  were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings .   this is a sad movie with a stupid ending .  if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character' ,  he'd have stayed with the mother ,  who was not that much older than him and quite attractive .  but in the end he 'falls' for the daughter ,  a shallow ,  rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth ,  but in an ordinary ,  bland way .   ( the 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive ,  physically .  )   there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter  ( who was an uptight ,  selfish ,  self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect )  to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted ,  sweet-tempered ,  humorous ,  and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend .  of course the mother had her own flaws .  .  .  she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter .   regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed ,  this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney .   ( where's the mustard ?  )
-1	i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in  " edison .  "  i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish ,  destroy the screen ,  readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism .  timberlake is horribly miscast ;  in fact ,  casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in  " patton ,  "  or nathan lane to play jesus .  but that is almost beside the point .   timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role .  i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent ,  but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench .  with his metrosexual lisp  ( read lithp )  ,  his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like  " the 25 cliché expressions for actors ,  "  he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly ,  and no matter how you slice it ,  i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist .  it simply will not fly .   however ,  timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure .  director david j .  burke puts him not only in the  ( essentially )  primary role ,  but also places him aside morgan freeman ,  kevin spacey ,  john heard ,  dylan mcdermott ,  cary elwes and  ( i'm surprised he was as good )  ll cool j .  i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake .   there is an upside to this of course :  the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief .  a pleasure ,  if you will .  freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together ,  but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero .  dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air .   but enough of timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick .   " edison "  is a very ,  very run-of-the-mill corruption story .  it's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous .  i do ,  however ,  admire the motivation behind making it ,  which i interpret as an homage to films like  " serpico ,  "  or  " donnie brasco ,  "  or maybe even  " chinatown .  "  don't get me wrong -  " edison "  is not even in the same ballpark as these films ,  but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence ,  perhaps to justify my sitting through it .   the script ,  in and of itself ,  features some surprisingly bad writing .  yes ,  it has some decent interchanges ,  but any conversation between piper perabo  ( who is wasted here )  and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode .  it's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality ,  let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate  ( and fail )  dialogue .  this dialogue ,  mind you ,  is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like  " edison "  wants to morph into a music video ,  where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting ,  but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds  ( read slow-motion )  .   thinking about it ,   " edison "  is a curiosity .  it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work .  in film as in most art ,  if one thing is off ,  the whole thing feels off .  directors must make tough choices .  david j .  burke missed the mark here .  some of the scenes play well in and of themselves ,  but as a whole ,  they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture .  and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with .
-1	having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie .  i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities ,  but this is not it .  this plays like a bottom-to-mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e . g .  ss experiment camp etc  ( perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually )  .  granted it has a greater scope and more people running around ,  but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non-actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots ,  spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock' sequence .  the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power .  watch channel 4's 'the holocaust'  ( aired recently  ( still running ?  )  ,  as of 1 no 2006 )  for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war  ( featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage )  .  this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves ,  not this hackneyed exploitation garbage  ( a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine ,  but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie )  .  rating :  3  ( 5 as exploitation ,  1 as a treatment of the subject )  .
-1	although ,  i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie ,  this sure as hell wasn't what i would have had in mind ,  had anything actually come to mind .  once i heard of its existence ,  all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don't eat the babies .  unfortunately ,  i could only find a copy under its alternate title ,  island fury .  looking back ,  i guess i could call it a lose-lose situation .  on one hand ,  i still don't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don't eat the babies ,  and on the other hand ,  island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful ,  pointless ,  boring ,  unwatchable piece of garbage .  yeah ,  definitely lose-lose .   i'm not even sure what genre they're going for here .  just early 80's badness ,  with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non-flashback .  first up ,  two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys ,  once caught ,  the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string ,  around her neck ,  and somehow ,  these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere .  and this is where things start to get weird ,  somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island ,  years earlier ,  when they were only 10 .  i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is .  so ,  now ,  we're in the past ,  while the girls try to retrace their steps ,  so these bad guys don't kill them ,  although ,  i wouldn't have minded if they had .  in the flashback ,  the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends ,  eventually stopping by an island for some air ,  they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents .  any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up ,  but the flashback was undeniably better than the present ,  which ,  still ,  isn't saying much .   for a while there i had forgotten about the original story ,  at one point ,  i ithought maybe the director had too ,  and when the flashback ended ,  that would be the end ,  which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half-hour shorter .  this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end ,  and real stuff does happen ,  but it's stupid .  i guess i didn't exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured ,  or anything like that ,  but i did expect some form of outlandish b-entertainment ,  mostly just a confusing ,  inept storyline ,  unsure of its genre .  my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures .  if anyone ,  i would only recommend this one to serious b-movie collectors who must have them all ,  anyone else interested probably has brain damage .  what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don't eat the babies .  3/10
-1	roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on .  all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family .   this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better .  as much as i didn't like  " barracuda "   ( that's on the same dvd )  i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane .   eye candy :  one pair of tits  ( they might belong to kirsten baker )    my grade :  f   dark sky dvd extras :  vintage ads for various drive-in food ;  and trailers for  " bonnie's kids "   ( features nudity )  ,   " the centerfold girls "  ,   " part-time wife "   ( features nudity )  ,   " psychic killer "  ,  &  " eaten alive "  .  the dvd also comes with 1978's  " barracuda "
-1	this is available on a  " drive in double feature "  from dark sky films ,  and since i just had finished up  " barracuda "  ,  i watched this too .  this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time .   we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town ,  but where exactly are they ?  they stop to look at necklaces from some chinese vendor ,  and try on chinese-style clothes at a shop ,  but then we see some aztec dancers ?  and all the while ,  these girls are being followed by two guys ,  who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town ,  and they finally catch them .   it seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck ,  and these guys want to find the loot ,  and where did she get it ?  so ,  in flashback ,  we go back to find out .  and how did they know she had this coin ?  hard to say ,  really .   now ,  back in the day ,  when these two women were 10 years old ,  they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat ,  and after stopped to get air in their tanks ,  they tow this young boy back to his home dock ,  only to have his grandpa come out & invite the  " young 'uns "  up for herbal tea with granny .  but not everyone has the tea ,  todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls ,  and then when they're away from it ,  the boat blows up ,  and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared .  well ,  it seems as though these  " kindly folk "  raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell ,  and serve it herbal tea .   but the girls and todd did leave the island ,  but now ,  they're returning ,  escorted by their captors ,  and they're there to find the treasure ,  despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before .  there also seems to be someone else on the island ,  and the thugs mysteriously begin to die ,  one by one ,  and since there's only three ,  it doesn't take long .  and there's even a sort of happy ending ,  which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film .   the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues ,  and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious .  the hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability ,  despite the fact that the grandpa is hank worden ,  who appeared in many films and tv shows .  the action is confusing ,  the locales are even more confusing ,  and the island looks like southern california .   so what the hell is this ?  i'm not sure ,  but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think  ( or say )  ,  huh ?  4 out of 10 ,  very bizarre .
-1	first of all i just want to say that i love this show !  !  !  but this episode .  .  . this episode makes a mockery of the entire show .   i don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series .   there is no story line ,  everything is chaotic and the jokes .  .  .  .  . are crap .   the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game .  .  .  .  .  for example  " how do the furlings look like "  by creating that stupid  " previously on .  .  .  "  .  .  .  .  .  . is simply embarrassing .   its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .
-1	this really should deserve a  " o "  rating ,  or even a negative ten .  i watched this show for ages ,  and the show jumped the shark around series 7 .  this episode ,  however ,  is proof that the show has jumped the shark .  it's writing is lazy ,  absurd ,  self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and butthead .   it is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- pirates of the caribbean ,  the mummy ,  count of monte cristo -- all  " fun "  movies that are not to be taken seriously .  however ,  there is such thing as ridiculous as in  " this is the worst thing i've ever seen .  "  and indeed ,  this is the worst episode of stargate i've ever seen .  it's absolutely dreadful ,  and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement .   makes me want to sell all of my stargate props ,  most seriously .
-1	i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago .  i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again .  the excessive amount of watery 'blood' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the  " whip-around "  wind sounds .  my friends and i made a super low budget movie ,  and the effects still exceeded this crap fest .   as for the amount of mistakes in this movie ,  there are way too many to count .  i knew one of the actors - believe it or not ,  he was my theatre teacher .  ha !    final verdict :  don't bother with this  " horror "  flick .    3 stars  ( out of a possible 73 )
-1	80 minutes ,  and it felt twice that long !  brief crossing is not brief enough .  indeed ,  the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue  ( more of a monologue ,  really )  of a woman approaching middle age ,  tediously droning about  " men ,  "  disappointment ,  sex ,  aging ,  and her recent breakup ,  to a french teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria .   the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty-free shop ,  and to a bar ,  where finally her self-involved rant pushes him away .  the  " story "  can't end there ,  of course ,  so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin .   what little romance ,  sex ,  or for that matter ,  anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all .  yes ,  the ending is very nicely done ,  but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner .   of course ,  some people like it .  i could be wrong .
-1	it has its merit's ;  morvern callar is both the merits and the disappointments .  she's so enigmatic ,  so original .  is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un-relatable ?  or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary ?  personally i'd call her dysfunctional .   morvern is completely detaching herself .  disposing of her boyfriend ,  not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral ,  she selfishly splashes out on a trip to spain .  she's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed .  the only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her .  although by the end her friend is dumped and morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity .  she may as well have killed herself .   despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director's shots were superb ,  the lighting and color made the film visually stunning .   it's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest .  it's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer .  they manage to make morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film .
-1	my wife and i watch a film every night with no distractions ,  and mostly artsy films that require thought .  i have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom .  my wife has double the attention span that i do .  all that being said-- this film is just plain empty and boring !  it went nowhere .  never blossomed .  it started fairly strong with a promising plot .  .  . then she bakes cookies .  .  . goes to spain .  .  .  . she sulks ,  she stares .  .  .  . the credits roll .  uneven ,  full of holes ,  false starts & dead ends .  we ff'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space .  artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried .  zzzz .  .  .  .  .  .  it's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy .  you never get to know nor understand morvern at all .  about halfway through you just don't care anymore .  we just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop .  don't waste your time on this .  i'm shocked it scores so high .
-1	my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show .  i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is .  but he goes on watching it none the less .  that is his right as an american i guess .  but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode .  it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand .  i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college .  my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed ,  but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors .  and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along  ( get the pun ,  ha , ha .  like spielberg did .  it's like jesus before he became a man .  or thats at least what i think that would feel like .  any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this ,  even though it contains little of peter falk .  i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet .  this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo's investigation ,  as many later episodes would do .
-1	nothing happens .   then characters with no personality don't develop .   then the end never comes because there's no beginning and no middle .   there are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be ,  because this movie isn't even there .  there's no  " is "  in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point .  there's nothing !    there is a good point :  it has a good soundtrack .  but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time ,  so if you're really interested ,  i'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something .  you'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue ,  headache ,  and impatience .   --polarisdib
-1	there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning ,  and that ignorant fools like me don't 'get' it .  obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood dross .   it has every ,  a-hem ,  artistic cliché in the book - i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few .  almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense .   the director of the  ( almost equally embarrassing )  movie 'ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense ;  it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation .  the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers .
-1	it was probably just my dvd---but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd .   i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level ,  in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog .  some of the talking still remained sub-audible .  if you're from scotland ,  you might have a chance ,  albeit a slim one .   peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds ,  including unwrapping a package ,  footsteps ,  even puffing on a cigarette .    with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard ,  i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment ,  such as a disco .  and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down .   there is art and there is art ,  even in the field of audio mixing .  but this effort ,  in a time of war ,  would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity .   after about a half hour ,  i gave up ,  having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture ,  either .
-1	when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible ,  the cause can invariably be found in the book :  either it was pointless to start with ,  or the point is one not easily conveyed to film ,  or the movie missed the point ,  which is the most frequent of these results ,  and the easiest to happen ,  especially when the point is one not easily defined .  the book  " morvern callar "  has a point ;  every reader of the book must have felt this ,  and felt as if he had gotten it ;  but i suspect most of them could not state it in words .  i'm not sure i can ,  myself ,  but perhaps it comes to this ,  or something like it :  things come ,  things go ,  such is life ,  but we carry on ;  or at any rate some of us--people like morvern--do .  no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition .  but the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view ,  and to carry over ,  in adapting the story to film .  the maker of this film evidently missed the point ,  and doesn't substitute one of her own ;  and so the film is about nothing .   this is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated .  the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly :  in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance ,  and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly .  the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated morvern ,  but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect ,  as if the author were poking at her with his pen ;  there are inconsistencies of style and tone ,  as if different sections had been composed at different times ;  and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not :  for instance ,  despite morvern's own self-characterization as a raver ,  am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class scots girl ,  and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past ?  in any case ,  despite my irritation at the author ,  i couldn't deny that his book stuck with me ;  and what i couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude ,  her angle on the world ,  which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait .  morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible ;  occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her ,  like flies ,  so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through ,  unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough .  the complex of incidents and of morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book ,  and its achievement ,  in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise ;  for all my dislike of the book ,  i can see this .   the morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie ;  or if it is ,  most of her is kept offscreen .  an actress who might have been a good fit for the character ,  had she been the right age at the right time ,  is angharad rees ,  from the old tv series  " poldark "  .  samantha morton ,  then ,  would seem like good casting :  she's rather the same sort of actress ,  and in one of her earlier movies ,   " jesus' son "  ,  she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one .  unfortunately ,  as the film turned out ,  she doesn't have the character from the book to play .  for one thing ,  the book is one that ,  if it is to be dramatized ,  virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience ;  without her comments ,  her perspective ,  her voice ,  the story loses most of its meaning .  it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements :  the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty ,  and so morvern's responses  ( whether of amusement or distaste ,  depending on her mood )  are missing too ,  and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story .  in short ,  the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk ,  edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art tv film ,  and chose as her typical image one of ms .  morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy ;  as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross .  this isn't at all what the book ,  or the morvern of the book ,  was about .  for another thing ,  the morvern of the movie isn't scottish  ( the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent )  ,  and she ought to be :  it's important that she ,  her family ,  and her mates are all from a single place .  and finally the film is missing the end of the story :  morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness :  it's winter ,  the dam has frozen ,  the power has gone out ,  and the pub is dark .  minus this ,  and minus all of the rest ,  what's left is a failed art film ,  a dead film ,  about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal ,  or native inability ,  ever to give in to being dead .
-1	lynne ramsey makes arresting images ,  and samantha morton can summon feeling with a gesture .  so what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered ,  pretentious lark .    ramsey can't bring callar to life .  her attempts are too arty and oblique .  repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if morton's obliterated gaze alone could supply character .  we are in a blank warholian hell of self-indulgence :  for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor ,  you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist .  but how will it do so if she rarely speaks ?  without the novel's interior monologue ,  the celluloid morvern callar is nobody .  small wonder ramsey has morton undress often .   that said ,  the first ten minutes were so impressively acted ,  shot and edited that my hopes were soaring .  give the film that much :  it knows how to make promises ,  if not how to keep any .
-1	i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen ,  besides the dead body in the first scenes .  .  .  and her disposal of him .  i was wrong .  it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven .  i really don't care what young lassies from scotland do these days ,  who thy screw ,  what drugs they take .  visually ,  the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me .  the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend .  as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts .  .  .  1 .  that's all there is ?  2 .  now i see why her boyfriend killed himself .  rename it .   " bare bitch boredom ,  or what i did on my trip to spain .  "  i'm such a sucker for sticking these things out .
-1	this film had a lot of promise ,  and the plot was relatively interesting ,  however the actors ,  director and editors seriously let this film down .   i feel bad for the writers ,  it could have been good .  the acting is wooden ,  very few of the characters are believable .   who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film .  there are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene ,  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying .   i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no ,  it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money .
-1	i'm a fan of arty movies ,  but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel .  agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise ,  the experience is ,  shall we say ,  trying .  even after bad movies i feel that i learn something ,  or enjoyed some aspect ,  but there there was nothing to appreciate .  the premise was not uninteresting ,  but the movie starts and ends there .  the acting was ok ,  though the characters were utterly boring .  for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal ,  she is mightily empty .  pity .  i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic ,  but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
-1	it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person ,  not even as an extra .  that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general .  - however .   no spoilers - only a brief introductory description :   buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in oslo .  the protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion ,  and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up .  the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models .  quite the cliché .  although the story is mildly funny ,  the acting is good and as a 'young person' one can sort of identify with the characters `crazy' situations and complicated love affairs ,  i don't find the story or the characters very believable .  to polished and lacking in depth .  this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends'  ( yes that show on tv )  .   has norwegian film finally found its identity ?  :  audience pleasers in well known american style .   how about watching lukas moodysson's tillsammans  ( together )  .
-1	since  " rugrats " ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years ,  obviously the tyrants at klasky-csupo should be out of ideas .  after dumbing down all of the characters ,  adding even stupider new ones ,  replacing some voices  ( though i like nancy cartwright ,  she is not chucky finster !  )  ,  and having no sense of continuity  ( ex .  :  in a kimi episode i watched the other day ,  tommy and chucky each got a new puppy ;  but it subsequent episode ,  the aforementioned dogs never appear )  ,  you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy .  but noooo .   all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks !  while not as horrible as the kimi episodes ,  everyone is even stupider than they were ,  including grandpa  ( my god !  he used to be the best character on the show ,  but now ,  he has no real purpose )  .  the ending is needlessly fluffy ,  and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes  ( '98-'01 )  is that the kids can interact with adults .  whoa ,  what fun !   no stars at all for  " the rugrats all growed up "  .  klasky-csupo ,  please destroy this show before it gets any worse .
-1	i don't understand how  " 2 of us "  receive such a high rating .  .  .  i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense ,  followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble .  however ,  i did like jared harris' performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours .
-1	***comments contain spoilers*** i was barely holding on to this show as appointment tv when they started the annoying music under every scene ,  when don epps was averaging almost a shooting per case ,  when the very nasally diane farr was obviously pregnant  ( but we weren't to notice )  and when colby was a f*****g triple agent .  but now ,  in tonight's episode , david is trapped with a paranoid ,  nut job who is an obvious amateur with a gun ,  in an elevator and .  .  .  . he can't disarm him .  a trained ,  experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand-to-hand fighting ,  can't take out a nut job .  not when said nut job blinks ,  looks away ,  drops his head ,  closes his eyes ;  not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds .   then the scene came that let me know that as much as i enjoy learning from the chubby ,  frumpish but very charming charles epps and his sexy sidekick/love interest amita ,  my friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged .  don gives david the  " distress word "  that is the code for  " the s**t is about to go down "  ;  david is ready ,  they kill the lights ,  drop the elevator ,  startle the nut job and .  .  .  .  .  .   david cannot disarm/kill/beat into submission the nut job .  the bad guy ends up with both guns ,  david ends up shot .   i'm done .  hope the numb3rs are fun .
-1	here ,  let me wave my hands over the keyboard ,  i'll tell you what salad she's going to order .  over and over ,  works like a charm :  he's such a genius ,  omg how does he do it ?  my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i'm scanning channels ,  i have to be very careful  ( these days it's useful far too often ,  so i don't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this .  .  . careful with that remote !  )  .  is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery ?  or what ?  why does it exist ?  ?   this is the most inane show ,  completely unbelievable and contrived ,  and i cannot understand why it's still on the air .  so may geeks give so much better shows such a hard time  ( sarah connor chronicles ,  true blood )  ,  but give this nonsensical drivel a pass .  shows like firefly  ( if there were any like that )  fall away after a season ,  but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on .  yeccch .
-1	as an engineer ,  i must say this show's first season started out very promising .  most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible ,  and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge .   but after the first season ,  the show started degrading ,  heavily .  most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real .   the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode ,  but in the end ,  this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show .   if you are gonna watch it ,  go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second .  thereafter i would not waste my time .  myself ,  i gave the show up midway through season 3 .   season 1 - 8 stars season 2 - 5 stars season 3 - 3 stars  let's sum that up to 4 stars .  since charlie doesn't know his math anymore ,  i won't bother with the correctness of mine either .
-1	after watching a dozen episodes ,  i decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling .  in the episodes that charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models ,  i thought that my profession was being joked about .  i am not a mathematician ,  instead a chemical engineer ,  but i do work a lot with mathematical models .  so i will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to  " make-believe "  of fairy tales .   first ,  choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task .  charlie eppes is shown as a genius ,  but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model ,  specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future .  individuals are erratic and haphazard ,  there is no modeling for them .  isaac asimov even wrote about that in the 1950's .  even if there were a model for specific kind of individual ,  it would be a probabilistic  ( stoichastic )  one ,  meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction .   second ,  supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found ,  the model parameters have to be known .  these parameters are the constants of the equations ,  such as the gravity acceleration  ( 9 . 8 m/s2 )  ,  and often are not easy to determine .  again ,  charlie eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses .  and after the model and the parameters are chosen ,  they would have to be tested .  oddly ,  they are not ,  and by miracle ,  they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted .   third ,  a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected ,  not only by numbers ,  but also by sci-fi movies :  the computational effort required for solving these models .  try to make excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a herculean job .  even if charlie eppes has the right software to solve his models ,  he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow .  and even with the right software/hardware combination ,  the model solution might well take days to be reached .  he solves them immediately !  i could use his computer in my research work ,  i would be very glad .   as a drama ,  it is far from being the best show .  the characters are somewhat stereotyped ,  but not even remotely funny as those in big bang theory are .  the crimes are dull and the way charlie eppes solves them sometimes make the fbi look pretty incompetent .   for some layman ,  the show might work .  for others ,  the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow !
-1	the  " math "  aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows .  the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow ,  although his career must have been  ( undeservedly )  waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock .   the lame-ness of the  " math "  aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring lou diamond phillips  ( which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned .  )  in order to catch a fugitive ,  the  " mathematician "  uses some theory about  " bubbles "  .  so ,  he gives this long explanation that ,  if we have seen the suspect in places a ,  b and c ,  then we can use  " bubble theory "  to calculate where he might be .  he does this all on a chalkboard ,  or maybe with a stick in the dirt  ( i cant remember )  .   anyway ,  when you look at the finished product ,  he basically took three spots ,  and picked a point right in the middle and said  " ok ,  mathematically ,  here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive .  "  at which point ,  one other character points out  " oh ,  that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live .  "  is that math ?  its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots !  !  !  this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to  " support "  points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense .   it just goes to show -- when you're a hammer ,  everything looks like a nail .  i can't wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama .  .  .  they'll use calculus ,  call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains ,  and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields .  .  .  cuz hey .  .  .  its all about the numbers .   totally ludicrous tv show .
-1	this is really really bad .  lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job .  but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric  " i got the evidence on you !  "  .   ( makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn't find it on itunes )  .  talk about seeing into the future .  .  . too funny for words .  the rest of the movie is forgettable .  the score and songs are more interesting than the script .  ditto the sequel .  which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all .  my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies .  doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits .
-1	" cia codename : alexa "  is an absolute horrible rip off of luc besson's classic film  " la femme nikita "  ( 1990 )  .  the film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the cia and is forced to do a secret mission for them .   ( pretty much the same story structure of la femme nikita )  the acting combo of lorenzo lamas and o . j .  simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history .  lamas'  " acting "  is simply a bad steven segal impersonation .  watching orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience .   the writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable .  there are so many action movie  " conventions "  in the film it is ridiculous :  unnecessary car explosions ,  people flying thru glass windows ,  terrorists ,  bad ponytails ,  etc .  the musical score resembles david michael frank's score for  " hard to kill "   ( 1990 )  ,  which furthers the steven segal theme of this movie .  there is plenty of martial arts in the film ,  and it is pretty well done for a low budget american production .  the mindless action and over the top acting never lets up ,  and i have to admit i was mildly entertained .    lorenzo lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star ,  that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters .  my recommendation is that you skip  " cia codename : alexa "  and check out  " la femme nikita "  instead .
-1	lorenzo lamas stars as some type of cia agent ,  who captures some exotic beauty named alexa ,  kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers .  o . j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble .  i must admit i'm not a fan of lorenzo lamas ,  or his movies .  he stinks .  however when compared to o . j simpson and lamas' comatose wife kinmont ,  lamas seems like ah ,  jean-claude van damme .  i only saw cia because of the renewed interest around the o . j simpson trial ,  you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels ,  you couldn't escape this movie .  in 1994 you could go to an amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable tv .  the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o . j simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor .  also where was bobby knight and kobe bryant to make this a complete camp classic ?    * out of 4- ( bad )
-1	spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie ,  lorenzo lamas does his usual tough guy/pretty boy act ,  and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa .  oj simpson is a detective ,  coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona .  translation :  cable tv filler .  there isn't enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure .   the script has some gaping holes .  best/worst moment :  in one jarring scene ,  oj's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue .  oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot ,  or words to that effect .  this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough ;  but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released ,  it is truly appalling ,  and therefore entertaining in an unintentional ,  horrible way .  i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose .  now that's a guilty pleasure .  bc
-1	as an impressionable 10 year old ,  i liked the  " love conquers all "  philosophy of the 70s sitcom  " bridget loves bernie .  "  i did understand the controversy ,  which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver  ( david birney )  and an irish catholic school teacher  ( meredith baxter )  and both sets of parents  ( harold j .  stone and bibi osterwald as bernie's parents ;  audra lindley and david doyle as bridget's parents )  who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage .   looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences ,  i am amazed that the show was even a success for one ,  albeit ,  highly-rated season .  created by veteran tv writer bernard slade ,  who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play  " same time ,  next year "  ,   " bridget loves bernie "  was a very light ,  superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight .   there was no denying the real-life chemistry between birney and baxter .  but ,  in later years ,  both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects  ( birney in his short-lived role in  " st .  elsewhere "  and baxter in  " family "  and  " family ties "  )  .  here ,  they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge ,  which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject .   the show aired saturday nights between two cbs powerhouses :   " all in the family "  and  " mary tyler moore "  .  both of those shows were smart ,  funny and had enough of an edge  ( more so on the former that the latter )  that kept my interest in the situation and the characters .   " bridget loves bernie "  was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles .   this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered .
-1	this movie is one long chiche after another .  first of all ,  though they did their share ,  there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot .  the wigs and accents are terrible .  they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons .  john is the nasty ,  envious ,  closet homosexual ,  slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book .  they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation  " it was always just the two of us "  !  john would not have been mean to his fans like this either .  like his death showed us he was too nice if anything .  the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday .  an insulted john says something along the lines of  " sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees ,  put on your wife's wig ,  and lick my liggin "  .  that made me laugh for days .  really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous .  john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day ,  they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here .  forget it .
-1	this film was hard to get a hold of ,  and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming .  i mean ,  this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century :  an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt .  with all of this built-in interest ,  how could anyone make such a lackluster ,  talk-laden flick of this true-life event .  while williams is always interesting ,  the screenwriters assumed that the d . b .  cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star ,  s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off .  harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty ,  but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction .  shame on this film for even existing .
-1	as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale ,  i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been .   the bad - i'm a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played ,  but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator .   the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage-mouth .  from what i read ,  there were several directors replacing each other on this film ,  and that's too bad .  you can tell things aren't right with the story .  i couldn't get  " involved "  with treat williams' portrayal of cooper ,  either .  he should have been fascinating ,  but he wasn't in this movie .  it's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of  " folk hero ,  "  but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy ,  too .   not everything was disappointing .  i can't complain about the scenery ,  from the lush ,  green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona .   i'd like to see this movie re-made and done better ,  because it is a one-of-a-kind story .
-1	i can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny .  shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty ,  disgust and stupidity ,  'there's something about mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end .  sure ,  cameron diaz is very pretty ,  but that is never going to be enough to save a movie .  ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot ,  and is obviously very talented ,  but the movie is a loser .   not once were any of the scenes believable .  the shots were badly timed and poorly framed .  the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs .  i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid .   2/10 ;  the bonus is from the one time i smiled .  it's not like i'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion .  my wife hated it ,  too .  the next day we saw 'rush hour' and laughed ourselves silly .  this movie just stunk .
-1	to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite .  i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing .  it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype ,  by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time ,  like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like  " blow up "  or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition ,  and people took it the wrong way .  being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen ,  but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq ,  its not right things are not like that .  people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act .  i am glad a show like this came on the air .  there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists , many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair ,  but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name .
-1	up until this new season i have been a big 'little mosque' fan .  however ,  the new season had absolutely ruined it .   the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show .  it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice .  the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light .   i am neither christian or muslim ,  but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend .  not any more .   just cancel it and be done with it .  it's not worth watching any more .   it might still be saved ,  but a lot of change would need to be made .   bring back the old format .
-1	who likes awful  " comedy "  shows like little mosque on the prairie ?  the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are :  one ,  muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all  ( which it is not )  .  two ,  old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable ,  badly written ,  stale jokes .   cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is .  if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen ,  their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left .  i'd be curious who even writes for this show ?  do you think it's actually muslims ,  or hip ,  funny young people ?  no ,  i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's .   when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are ,  air farce was only finally just taken off the air  ( thank goodness !  )  but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for ,  not to mention this poor excuse for  " comedy "  little mosque on the prairie .  it is supposed to be offencive and funny ?  only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny .  shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .
-1	unlike many ,  i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive .  its execution ,  however ,  is another matter entirely .  like so many b-minus movies ,  all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers .  for most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor .  or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers .  with a couple of exceptions the acting is awful ;  the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial ,  but not a primetime sitcom  ( even a canadian one .  )  notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle ,  i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas .  unfortunately ,  they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies .  the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town  ( why ?  are they so hard to find in saskatchewan ?  )  did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors ?  as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon ,  and that the rest of the world ,  primed by the cbc's publicists ,  quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom .
-1	without wishing to be a killjoy ,  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them ,  and camp blood being another .    the acting is terrible ,  the print is shoddy ,  and everything about this film screams  " seriously ,  you could do better yourself "  .  maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap ?   i bought this for £1 ,  but remember ,  you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life .  you'd do well to avoid this turkey ,  even at a bargain basement price .
-1	i was really hoping that this would be a funny show ,  given all the hype and the clever preview clips .  and talk about hype ,  i even heard an interview with the show's creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the world .   unfortunately ,  this show doesn't even come close to delivering .  all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist .  all of the characters are one-dimensional .  the acting is - well - mediocre  ( i'm being nice )  .  it's the classic cbc recipe - one that always fails .   if you're muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters ,  and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ,  ignorant ,  or both .  not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that .  it's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show .   canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis .  so how come the producers of this show couldn't find any ?
-1	this show is terrible ,  the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse .  i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two ,  all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them .  well at least corner gas was good at first ,  little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 .  who are the people who are watching this show anyway ,  i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies ?  maybe the jokes are for them and they work there ?  i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself ,  the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas .  hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show .
-1	while i have never been a fan of the original scooby-doo  ( due to its horrid production values )  ,  it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by hanna-barbera !  without a doubt ,  scrappy-doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children  ( and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm )  .  whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby-doo characters with it ?  !  whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show  ( i think death is preferable )  .  the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny ,  annoying and grates on the nerves--and this is only in the better episodes !  !  after many years ,  it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess !  i can see why in the live-action scooby-doo movie they made the villain scrappy-doo--since practically everyone hates him !
-1	if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both ,  you'll probably have to look elsewhere .  lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés .  at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess .   beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame ,  innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing .  and once the  " zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao !  !  "  hype wears out its welcome ,  the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone .   unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype .  other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies .  lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight .
-1	i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all .  the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about !  i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason ,  they are usually true .  but there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters .  the  " fresh of the boat "  dad ,  who doesn't understand his daughter .  the radical feminist muslim daughter  ( who by the way is a terrible actress )  ,  and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can  ( he's a pretty good actor ,  i only see him getting better )  .   it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well .  there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed ,  and don't really care to watch another episode .   i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again ,  she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does ,  too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities !
-1	little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen .  they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farmers in saskatchewan .  the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it .  the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded .  very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as  " controversial "  well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes ,  royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report .
-1	this series just gets worse and worse .  poorly written and just plain not funny !  the premise is excellent ,  but the writer's inexperience shines through .  by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone .  now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about ,  and resorted to that patronizing ,  smug ,   " oh ,  silly you "  style acting that comes with a no laugh script .  they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say ,  aren't we zany ?  isn't this funny ?  well ,  no ,  it's not actually .  gum disease is less painful .  no wonder ,  with the exception of corner gas ,  canadians generally avoid canadian tv .  come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent .  pull the plug on this amateurish mess .
-1	once again canadian tv outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode .    last time i remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter .  how funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all muslims are terrorists ?  ok maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses .  but not 30 minutes .  it's called beating a dead horse .  even snl would know to give up after a commercial break .   also ,  let's have a little conflict in these scripts .  will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on ramadan ?  when will ramadan start ?  ohhhhh this is emmy winning stuff here .    and the characters !  what characters ?  !  they are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next .  that's the point of the situation comedy .  we need to have strong ,  interesting ,  dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the tv set each week .  we have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they're going to get into next week .  if i never see these characters it'll be too soon .  thankfully i can't remember any of their names  ( note to cbc - that's not a good sign )  .   and the acting is so bland .  it's more so a problem in casting than in the actors .  none of these people actually embody the characters they play .  they just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week .  sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray .  watch any american sitcom and you'll see how easily identifiable characters are .  part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying .  that level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows .  but to be honest ,  considering the lame concept and the horrible writing ,  there's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture .  as another commenter mentions ,  this seems like a tv movie and not a sitcom .   and the directing or lack there of !  what can i say ,  canada has so much talent ,  look at what the comedy channel is doing with puppets who kill and punched up .  look at the trailer park boys  ( not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog )  .  look at any american show to see the potentials our talent as that's where many of our stars go to find decent work .   give credit to the cbc ,  they really know how to build publicity for a non-event .  remember  " the one "  ?  no - well don't even try to learn any characters names in this show ,  as it's sure to go the way of the dodo .   let's all hope for a full blown actra strike so that nothing like this emerges from the ceeb for a good long while .
-1	this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news ,  sports ,  or satirical sketch comedy .  as a developer of situation comedy ,  cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of  " king of kensington "  with the belly laughs of  " the beachcombers "  .  it is an embarrassment to great shows like  " kids in the hall "  and  " second city "  that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production .   i have to admit ,  that i didn't give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept .  to start ,  half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip-off one of the few sitcom successes in english-canadian history ,   " corner gas "  .  the rest of the concept--the cultural clash--is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness .  the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the  " fish out of water "  characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be  " edgy "  and  " topical "  ,  but comes off as forced .  some of the jokes that are based around the local's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved ,  especially the audience .   this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn't  " get it "  when it comes to creating canadian content ,  especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment .  cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy-handed and forced way .  it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity .  i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle .  a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas--i . e .  the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines .  more realistically ,  their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics .   that being said ,  even as a formulaic fish-out-of-water comedy this show fails .  the acting is weak ,  the comic pacing all over the map ,  and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief ,  even for a comedy .  the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath ,  who is horribly wasted here .  i doubt that even the addition of guest stars  ( colin mochrie ,  for example ,  as an anglican archbishop )  can save this dog .  i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc's 'hype' had died down ;  but two episodes were all i could stand--i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline .  the time-slot would be better served by airing more coronation street ,  air farce re-runs ,  or dr .  who .  even an infomercial would be an improvement .
-1	i think the show had a pretty good concept to work with .  but the execution was poor .  the script is poor and acting is bad .  there were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way ,  like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard .  the show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably .  i should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of muslim community to some extent .   till now second season is worse than the first one .  i had my hopes high regarding this show ,  but i was kind of disappointed .  still i appreciate cbc for putting up such concept in front of the viewers .  anyway i wish best of luck for the future .
-1	i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel .   " i'm thinking matrix ,  i'm thinking bladerunner ,  i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel ,  wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her ,  leave that one with us .  only - get this !  - we'll do it without any plot ,  dialogue ,  character ,  decent action or budget ,  just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike .  fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes ,  right ?  "   flashy ,  shallow ,  dreary ,  formulaic ,  passionless ,  tedious ,  dull ,  dumb ,  humourless ,  desultory ,  barely competent .  live action anime without any action ,  or indeed any life .  sf just the way joe fanboy likes it ,  in fact .   :  (
-1	wow ,  here it finally is ;  the action  " movie "  without action .  in a real low-budget setting  ( don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times )  of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood .   there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies ,  mainly  " matrix "  without having the money to do it right .  yes ,  we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs  ( 45 secs approx .  )  but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then .   and ,  yes ,  we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere ,  as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes .   believe me ,  it is as bad as it possibly can get .  in fact ,  it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously ,  but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money .
-1	god ,  i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot .  i had been expecting a lot from it ,  as i'm a huge fan of james cameron  ( and not just since  " titanic "  ,  i might add )  ,  and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality  ( then again ,  he also wrote the leaden strange days .  .  )  .  but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration .  in all that time ,  it barely went beyond its two line synopsis ,  and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere .  on top of that ,  i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular  " a-team "  episode .  as for alba ,  yes ,  she is gorgeous ,  of course ,  but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie  ( pouty and surly )  ,  makes me also get bored of her  " gal wit an attitude "  schtick pretty soon .  you can count me out of this one ,  mr .  cameron !
-1	awful ,  simply awful .  it proves my theory about  " star power .  "  this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed  ( battlestar )  titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick .  b o r i n g .   find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your tv with no picture and no sound .  1/10  ( i rated it so high b/c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb . com rating system .  )   -zaphoid  ps :  my theory about  " star power "  is :  the more  " star power "  used in a show ,  the weaker the show is .   ( it's called an indirect proportionality :  quality 1/ " star power "  ,  less  " sp "  makes for better quality ,  etc .  another way to look at it is :   " more is less .  "  )   -z
-1	what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe .  during the first season ,  dark angel was on my weekly  " must see "  list ,  and not just because of jessica alba .   unfortunately ,  the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to  " fine-tune "  the plotline .  within 3 episodes of the season opener ,  they had totally lost me as a viewer  ( not even to see jessica alba !  )  .  i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish .  the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin .  on one of the second season episodes ,  they even had max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep .   the moral of the story  ( the one that hollywood never gets )  :  if it works ,  don't screw with it !   azjazz
-1	a story of amazing disinterest kills  " the psychic "  over and over again .  the characters and plot are completely uninteresting  ( as is fulci's mad camera work ,  which is usually a redeeming factor in his films )  ,  and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found .  it's padded out to an insufferable degree--by the end ,  you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom  ( and ,  like me ,  maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep )  .  jennifer o'neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie .  fulci gorehounds beware--there's just not much going on in  " the psychic .  "   3/10
-1	i grew up on scooby doo where are you ,  and i still love it .  it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck ,  talespin ,  peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry .  this show though is good for kids ,  the voices are good ( don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy )  ,  the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation .  however it is rather disappointing .  i normally don't mind scrappy ,  but when he appears to be like the main character ,  it gets annoying fast .  complete with the catchphrase puppy power ,  scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual .  also half the gang are missing after the first year ,  somehow it didn't feel like scooby doo .  and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal ,  very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies .  all in all ,  not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo : get a clue ,  but this show is disappointing .  4/10 for the animation ,  voices ,  theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids .  bethany cox
-1	average  ( and surprisingly tame )  fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards ,  but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance .   the genre's well-known weaknesses are in full gear :  banal dialogue ,  wooden acting ,  illogical plot points .  and the finale goes on much too long ,  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say :  limp affair .   fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing ,  though .  yellow clues wherever you look .   3 out of 10 limping killers
-1	i was really disappointed in this movie .  those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose .  the acting was ok ,  kinda wooden and cardboard .  the ending was sorry .  i just didn't care for this at all .   no way could i recommend this mess .
-1	man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy .  now most of the rest of the film was okay .  it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing .  yes alderich is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others .  the problem isn't with direction ,  acting or anything technical .  the movie is just destroyed in the third act .  why ?  the murders ,  twists ,  turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material ?  what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that ?  the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest deus ex machina in history .  for all the complaints about burton's planet of the apes ,  the life of david gale or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever .  what a let down .
-1	this movie is just plain dumb .   from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax ,  the film is an exercise in wooden predictability .   mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths .  unlike marlow and spade ,  who put pieces together to solve the mystery ,  hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth .  this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are  .  .  .  well ,  too dumb to get away with anything .  one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack .   other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book .  velda's dance at the barre ,  for instance ,  or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back .  and the continuity breaks are shameful :  frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot .  the worst break ,  however ,  precedes the popcorn attack .  the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero ,  except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy .   to be fair ,  there were some interesting camera angles and lighting ,  and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen ,  which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10 .
-1	how did mike hammer live - in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace ?  nah ,  he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house ,  wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face ,  that's how .  spillane wrote trash paperbacks ,  for sure ,  but how do you make it worse ?  give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office ,  add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard ,  drugged out screen writer ,  that's how !
-1	this is one of the worst films i've ever seen .  i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel ,  and i wish i hadn't .  i turned it off after a little less than an hour ,  though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes .  i wish i had .  it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors .  unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes  ( which would be impossible )  i would in no way recommend this .  its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century .  i don't think ,  as many people say that it is ,  that  " the bell jar "  is necessarily unfilmable ,  but this particular rendition could have been done without .  i'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .
-1	i rented this movie from the library  ( it's hard to find for good reason )  purely out of curiosity .  i'm a huge plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment .  the bell jar  ( 1979 )  is by far one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  the script is horrible ,  not because it strays from the original novel text ,  but because it strays without focus or intent .  the scenes are ill-constructed and don't lead the viewer anywhere .  what's with the hokey voice over of plath's poetry ?  lady lazarus has little do with greenwood's situation ;  plath's poetry was completely misused .  marilyn hassett is completely unbelievable as esther greenwood  ( or any 20 year old for that matter )  partly due to casting  ( she was 32 during filming ,  the age plath was when she died )  and partly due to the fact that she can't act .  hassett is all emotion ,  no craft ,  no skill .  the direction is mediocre ;  the director simply covers what's there ,  which isn't much .  the only reason i'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 isn't an option .  sorry sylvia ,  you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .
-1	jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen's most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin .  larry peerce's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy .  robert klein certainly think it's the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film .  normally ,  i don't like to let myself get so ascerbic ,  but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite books ,  and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .
-1	after the success of scooby-doo ,  where are you ,  they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show .  but unfortunately ,  they added a new character that spoilt scooby-doo success forever .  they invented a new show with a new title ,  scooby and scrappy-doo .  it was scrappy-doo that made this show a complete failure ,  probably for both adults and kids together .  scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up .  scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain ,  and they were also trying to stop him .  scooby-doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews .  if they wanted scooby-doo to be more successful ,  they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy .  this was just poor ,  maybe your kids will prefer it !
-1	the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s .  this show quack pack shouldn't even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales .  it's about a teen-aged huey ,  dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales .  i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales .  there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg .  there's no references of scrooge mcduck .  the stories are repetitive ,  the plot is boring but the animation is good .  if you want lots of slapstick humor ,  i recommend this to you .  if you want a better disney show watch  " darkwing duck "  or  " ducktales "  .
-1	saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm .  several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw .  first ,  the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years .  several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed .    the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so ,  at least a huge gap with black screen appeared .  it is too bad ,  because even though the script left something to be desired ,  bergman & russell both did fine in the film in their roles .  it is a shame the large chunk is missing ,  but what is here is watchable .   i just wish it was all intact .  the script makes little sense in that bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults ?  some of the time lines don't make sense either .  there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1 .  all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine .  just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing .
-1	by 1941 columbia was a full-fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as mgm ,  paramount or warners .  that's the best thing that could be said about  " adam had four sons ,  "  a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by ingrid bergman  ( top-billed for the first time in an american film )  and warner baxter .  bergman plays a frenchwoman  ( this was the era in which hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another )  hired as governess to baxter's four sons and staying on  ( with one interruption caused by the stock-market crash of 1907 )  until the boys are grown men serving in world war i .  just about everyone in the movie is so goody-good it's a relief when susan hayward as the villainess enters midway through  she's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she's clearly channeling bette davis and vivien leigh ;  it's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles  but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous .  no wonder bergman turned down the similarly plotted  " the valley of decision "  four years later .
-1	you'd think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better .  sadly ,  the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled .   the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family .  everything is so very peachy and swell--the family adores bergman and things couldn't be more perfect .  well ,  that is until the mother  ( fay wray )  dies ,  the stock market crashes in 1907  ( wiping out the family's fortune )  and bergman is forced to go back home to france .  this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet ,  but not bad .   later ,  after the family's fortunes have improved ,  bergman returns .  the four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a conceivable reason why they'd hire her once again as a governess .  but ,  briefly ,  everything is swell once again .  but ,  when wwi occurs ,  the four all go to war--gosh !  in the midst of this ,  one of the sons  ( david )  brings home his new wife  ( susan hayward )  .  miss hayward's character is as black and white as the others ,  though while they are all good and swell ,  she's obviously a horny she-devil .  to make things worse ,  she comes to live in the family home while david is at war .   now here is where the movie gets really ,  really dumb--brain-achingly dumb .  hayward begins an affair with one of david's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers ,  bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her ,  not hayward with jack !  why ?  !  why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman ?  this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all !  this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad .  .  . and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941 .   the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward's evilness to be exposed .  this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess .  as expected ,  however ,  the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again---happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut ,  hayward .   the film suffers because of poor writing .  hayward's affair made no sense--at least in how it was handled .  and ,  having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil  ( with nothing in between )  sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap .  the only thing that saves it at all is the acting---they tried as best they could with a turgid script .  suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken !
-1	i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons .  they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film .  warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr's character .    like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i ,  in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed .    but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things ?  that's susan hayward's job here .  in one of her earliest prominent roles ,  hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son ,  has an affair with another ,  and starts making a play for the third .  it's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live .   i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays ,  everyone is afraid to tell father what's going on .  the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman .  here's where the plot gets a little silly .  bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids .  wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business .  bergman has to be let go .  she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up .    i'm sorry ,  but i can't believe the kids need a governess now .  hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn't the kids who brought her back .  in the normal course of things ,  bergman would have gotten on with her life .    one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out .  possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have .   it's too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback .   susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons .  and i'm willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor .
-1	i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever .  i didn't realize it was disney until it was too late .  i was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story .  it was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader's book report on the novel .  meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses .  mrs murray  ( meg's mother )  was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all ;  they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet .  and that's just the beginning .  by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen ,  much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book .  i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one .  the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book ,  this movie is kinda alright .
-1	first of all ,  i am a huge fan of madeleine l'engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books ,  a wrinkle in time .  this movie ,  however ,  ruined that excitement for me .  i am sorry ,  but meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool .  in the movie ,  she has straight hair and no glasses and is the  " sporty type "  with a deep voice .  this is not how madeleine l'engle pictured meg to be at all .  in fact ,  meg was based on madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young .  this is just one major example how the book and movie are different .  so i would say ,  if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes ,  watch it but if you are a devoted fan of madeleine l'engle and her wrinkle in time series ,  i would suggest skipping this movie .
-1	we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books .  while not particularly accurate adaptations ,  these movies were nonetheless excellent films .  some great examples are the harry potter series ,  the lord of the rings trilogy ,  and ,  to a lesser extent ,  almost every disney film ever made .  however ,  i must regretfully announce that a wrinkle in time is not one of those movies .  not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine l'engle's fan base ,  it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting ,  acting ,  special effects and ,  ultimately ,  respect for the audience .  mind you ,  i'm not trying to be mean ;  on the contrary ,  i went into this affair with an open mind .  i figured that a made-for-t . v .  movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script .  after all ,  the star wars spin-off ewoks was decent ,  if a little silly .  come to think of it ,  the original star wars was made on  " a lunch money budget "  ,  and look where it took george lucas !  however ,  from the first scene onward ,  disappointment started enveloping me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while tessering .    the same way greedo shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997  ( a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic )  ,  mrs .  whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a wrinkle in time .  the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief .  aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting alfre woodard  ( star trek :  first contact and radio )  as our favorite star-turned-mentor ,  the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow .  that's right ,  a crow .  moreover ,  the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old ;  the majestic half-man ,  half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle .  had i been five ,  this would have psychologically traumatized me for life .  the worst part is the fact that when it spoke ,  it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync ,  resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single ,  unmoving cheek ,  thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e . t .   having gotten the most painful part out of the way ,  i must go on to the tear-inducing one :  the characters ,  the acting ,  and the story .  i ,  personally ,  had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to moaning myrtle from the harry potter films :  plain hair ,  glasses ,  and a figure most supermodels would find laughable .  she was always a slightly anxious ,  humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of nicaragua .  in the film ,  she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever .  in fact ,  she makes me feel sorry for poor mr .  jenkins ,  her school principal ,  who continuously has to deal with her .  calvin ,  the kind ,  intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock !  the irony is horrible .  as for the memorable happy medium ,  they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is  " above gender "  and likes to look at  " funny "  things ,  such as girls falling off of swings .  the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace ,  mrs .  whatsit and the man with red eyes  ( nicknamed  " the dude with red eyes "  due to his complete reinvention as a character )  .   the story is a mess .  a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ,  which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book ,  yet kept the sole of the original work .  here ,  the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with hades down in the underworld ,  apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed .  as the dark lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen ,  the flat-nosed wookies of ixchel  ( who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks )  tear the spine up .  as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth-like camazotz was ,  the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil .    i am very sorry that this film exists .  i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad .  it's the way the characters are written that ruins it .  a wrinkle in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence kasdan ,  directed by george lucas or steven spielberg ,  enhanced at industrial light and magic ,  scored by john williams ,  given its sound at skywalker sound ,  edited by thx and marketed by twentieth century fox .  in its current state ,  the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people .  even madeleine l'engle thought it was bad .  the book was good ,  the film was bad ,  and mrs .  whatsit was ugly .   score :  0 . 1/10  ( if i could )    pros :   they got the names right .    cons :    it had horrible problems with the cliffs notes level of adaptation ,  script ,  acting and special effects ,  not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book .  oh ,  and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle .  some might say that this symbolizes high adventure .  i say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who didn't even bother to photoshop meg's arm on properly .
-1	this movie barely followed the story line of the movie .  all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie .  they ended up turning it into a cheesy  " tween "  disney movie  " crush "  story between meg and calvin .  it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part ,  or one of the likes .  this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book .  i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap ,  basic rendition .  if you've ever read the book ,  i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of  " lord of the rings "  equivalence .  this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time .  poorly done .
-1	horrible acting ,  horrible cast and cheap props .  would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie .  what a waste .  starting from the name of the movie .    " the enemy "  naming it  " action movie "  would've made it better .   ( contributing to the parody effect )  .  the cop looking like a 60 year old player ,  the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times .  towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie .  horrible .  don't waste your time .
-1	i only recently found out that madeleine l'engle's novel had been turned into a tv movie by disney and ordered the dvd .  the book was a favorite of mine when i was a child and i read it several times .   despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel ,  the murry family is well cast ,  with a likable  ( if too pretty )  meg at the center and a charles wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating .    the first half hour is promising enough ,  doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene .  unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart .  alfre woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric mrs whatsit  ( think miriam margolis or joan plowright instead )  and kate nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive ,  she must have visited faye dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years .  for some reason they make her mrs which look like glinda from the wizard of oz when she should have resembled a benign wicked witch of the west .   in the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction .  i understand that this is a tv movie ,  but the cgi looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier .  mrs whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the chewbacca like suit for aunt beast ,  who in the novel is a velvety ,  elegant creature instead of the ungainly big foot like thing shown here .  i could go on and on ,  nearly every artistic choice is a disaster ,  presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice ,  but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement .   this really would have needed the sense of wonder spielberg brought to his early films .  what a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting a wrinkle in time and it's sequels for the big screen ,  giving it the scope it deserves .
-1	i have never read the book " a wrinkle in time "  .  to be perfectly honesty ,  after seeing the movie ,  do i really want to ?  well ,  i shouldn't be reviewing this movie i'll start off with that .  next i'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable .  do you know why i say that ?  because i forgot what happens in it .  i told you it was forgettable .  to be perfectly honest ,  no tv movie will ever be better than  " merlin "  .   how do i describe a tv movie ?  i have never written a review for one before .  well ,  i'll just say that they usually have some celebrities .  a wrinkle in time includes only one .  alfre woodard ( or woodward ,  i am not sure )  ,  the oscar winner .    the film has cheesy special effects ,  a mildly interesting plot ,  scenes that make you go  " wtf "  .  the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go " wtf "  .  what did i expect ?  it's a tv movie .  they usually aren't good .  as is this one .  a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster .  to top it off ,  you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over .  well ,  maybe not the second it's over .  but within a few minutes .   a wrinkle in time : */****
-1	i was browsing through netflix and stumbled upon this movie .  having fond memories of the book as a child ,  i decided to check this out .  this is a movie that you should really pass on .   it is just not worth seeing .  it is very boring and uninteresting .  i feel that it would even be that way to small children .  it has no magic that the book contains .  this movie is not horrible ,  but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it .   there are moments that just come off as weird .  the witch character is not very good .  the family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening .  i know this is a kids movie ,  so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things ,  but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before .   the dvd that i had began skipping in the final moments of the film ,  and instead of trying to fix it i just turned it off and sent it back to netflix .  i really didn't care how it finished .  skip this film and read the book instead .
-1	i have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago .  and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching .  supposedly a movie had been made in the past ,  but i'd never been able to locate it .  well ,  my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l'engle's excellent book to the screen .    as i watched the movie ,  i had the highest of hopes .  as the film went on ,  i became more and more despondent .  they had botched it badly !  never had i been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption .  i understand that films can't stick strictly to a book ,  but they don't need to change things for the sake of it !  most ,  if not all ,  of departures from the book were totally unnecessary !    i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie .  well ,  it wasn't just me .  nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that madeline l'engle had so skillfully created !    why ,  they wondered ,  did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie ?  why couldn't calvin's hair have been red ?  why did mrs .  which not have the proper  " witch-like "  outfit that was such a clever play on her name ?  basically ,  we all wondered--why did nearly every single detail have to be changed ?    i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make .  i am still waiting for that movie .  this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses .  i'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task !
-1	( this may be a bit on the spoilerish side )  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie ,  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed .  that of course is the problem with taking ,  what many believe to be an amazing book ,  and turning it into a disney made-for-tv movie .   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago .  it's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults .  plus it's got built in quality sequels .  but disney-fying was not the way to go .  the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book .  it is a complicated and emotional story for kids .  there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  " psychic "  ,  because that was the easiest way of explaining it .  there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs .  w's as added tension ,  there is enough tension in the story without that .  there was no reason to remove meg's glasses .  .  .  that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book .   i could nitpick for days about little things ,  but i also think larger things ,  like the art direction was a off .  take for instance the way they made camazotz look ,  with its strangely darkened skies .  the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth .  it looks like earth .  it has people on it that look like humans .  the skies are blue ,  the grass is green ,  and there are children playing .  but something is a little bit off .  the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie .  the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth ,  that is if we forget how to love .  it would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm .   i unfortunately did not watch the end .  maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well .   overall an artistic disappointment .
-1	i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas l'engle brought out in her novel .  we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it ,  i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film .  there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l'engle !  this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating .  don't see this movie if you are a big fan of l'engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed .  however ,  if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes  ( or educational as was my case )  then it is an alright movie !
-1	i have read the whole 'a wrinkle in time' book and then saw the movie .  the movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting .   a wrinkle in time is about a girl named meg ,  charles wallace ,  and calvin must team together to find meg's father and get off the island camazotz .    the beginning of the film is really a stinker .  the acting is awful ,  the direction is laughable ,  and so far the situations aren't necessary .  i really was crushed to see the same person madeleine engle that wrote the book and created the movie ,  made a great book ,  and a terrible film .  the acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting .  yes ,  i got to admit there was cool effects .  but seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible .  if you read the book you will be crushed by the movie .  i wish could give it a 0 but sadly i can only give it 1 .  a half could have been useful .
-1	the  " wrinkle in time "  book series is my favorite series from childhood .  i have read and re-read them more times than i can count over the last 35+ years .  the characters ,  with all their virtues and flaws ,  are near and dear to my heart .  this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful ,  magical ,  spiritual story that i love so much .  to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement .   if you have never read the book ( s )  i imagine you will enjoy the movie .  the acting is passable ,  the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie ,  and the story is interesting .  however ,  if you love the books ,  avoid this movie at all costs .   i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel :   " in an interview with newsweek ,  l'engle said of the film ,  'i expected it to be bad ,  and it is . ' "   i ,  like another reviewer here ,  feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .
-1	i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it .  the movie ,  however ,  did not meet my expectations .  having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies .  the characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book .  the direction was weak .  i had a hard time getting into the characters .  there wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on .  the dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening .  it just seemed slapped together and rushed through .  all in all i was very disappointed with the movie .  i suppose if you haven't read the book ,  it might be ok by itself .  at the very least ,  it might entice you to read the book ,  which you'll probably enjoy more .
-1	this abc straight-to-tv failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is a wrinkle in time .  ms .  madeleine l'engle brought children and adults alike into a magical ,  fantastical and original world like no author before her .  this novel ,  the first in her 'time quartet' ,  is a beautiful take on life ,  the universe ,  and time itself .  yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand .  its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book .  this film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of ms .  l'engle's work of art .  honestly ,  what were they thinking ?  the effects look cheap and ridiculous ,  the plot is mushy and uneven ,  the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost .  this was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen .  i sincerely hope that someday an intelligent ,  worthy director  ( guillermo del toro ,  david yates ,  alfonso cuarón )  makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is :  a masterpiece .  this adaptation can only be compared to boring ,  fake and cheap motel-room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience .
-1	disney ?  what happened ?  i really wish the movie had been set in the 60's  ; like the book was .  and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption .  .  .  .  .  i'm glad that ,  maybe ,  someone might be influenced to read the books .  .  .  .  .  but ,  the man with red eyes interchangeable as it ?  and what's up with the volcanic upheaval ?  where was that in the book ?  peter jackson !  save us !  !  !  !  a long time ago  ( 1978 )  i heard that there was european version of this film .  i sure wish i could id it .  i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption .  this movie needs to be x'd .
-1	i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles .  my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time ,  and would think ,  what an amazing movie this would make .  sadly enough that screenwriter failed ,  changing characters ,  throwing in lame humor ,  and all out destroying the plot .  i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie .  but why can't you stay true to the book ?  why must you change the way characters think and act ?  for those of you who have not read the book ,  pick it up ,  find a soft couch ,  and let your imagination run wild .
-1	ho-hum .  an inventor's ( horst buchholz ) deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands .  unknowingly his son ( luke perry ) has been working on the antedote all along .  enter cia agent olivia d'abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins .  also in the cast are : tom conti ,  hendrick haese and an aging roger moore .  moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts .  perry fans will be accepting .  d'abo is wrong for the role ,  but nice to look at .
-1	the book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you ,  but then ,  as it diverges more and more from the book ,  taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches ,  it becomes boring .  still ,  from comments i've heard ,  people who have not read the book tend to like it ,  and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time ,  it will have served its purpose .  the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins' uncle albert  ( i love to laugh )  .  nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .
-1	awful .  this thriller should have buried .  what a piece of crap .  terrible writing ,  characters are less than believable .  horrible schlock !  !  stick some b- stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit ,  but it fails miserably .  if i didn't have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review ,  it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it' .   horrible ending ,  retarded .  who writes this crap .  the ending of this film is so contrived ,  weak it's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line ,  or they just ran out of money .  most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie .  it's a good thing that these actors are on the way out ,  because this would be a career killer .  good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it .  at least no one important ,  like future investors .  it could have ended a thousand different ways ,  but as it is ,  i feel cheated out of my precious time .   don't bother with this one ,  you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .
-1	these were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom .  first ,  i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that .  then ,  reaching 70th minute i was convincing myself that it's only a few more minutes ,  and i lasted to the very end which i'm kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human's patience and crap tolerance .  was it worth watching at all ?  well ,  as i wrote above ,  if you want to test yourself ,  give it a try and if you're strong willed enough ,  you may even last to the end .  .  .  the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all .  all happenings in the movie ,  you can be sure you saw somewhere before ,  and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel .
-1	this movie was poorly written ,  poorly acted and very predictable .  it was very low-budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video .  it wasn't even campy fun ,  it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the 1-1/2 hours back !  the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them .    the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch !  skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre .  just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this .   ejames6342
-1	this  " movie "  is such a bad work !  nothing seems to even try and be realistic .  plot is weak ,  acting - miserable ,  actors wondering around like in a 1st year production ,  trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning .  what a flop !  what a waste of time ,  money and effort to all concerned including the audience .  well ,  as in any thriller ,  here too are murders ,  corpses and blood .  just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago ,  committed a murder with a knife ,  and came out calm and smiling ,  not to mention clean as a whistle ,  as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent .  also ,  this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male ,  and she cut his throat !  !  !  did she ask him ,  politely ,  to bend down for her ?  much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one .  continuity is another huge problem as for instance :  the eager-hungry groom is lying in bed ,  waiting for his virgin-bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while ,  falls asleep (  !  ?  !  )  .  next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area ,  asking for guidance to scenery spots !  not a word about last night ?  ?  ?  such a waste of time even to try and write about this low-low supposed-to-be  " movie "  .
-1	as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face .  talk about insulting .  i was writing better stories than this in 8th grade .  bad acting ,  bad writing ,  bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure .    the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time .  who would green light something so poorly written ?  it's not artistic ,  clever ,  smart ,  suspenseful ,  mysterious ,  scary ,  dramatic-nothing .   the characters are flat and boring with no development .  the plot is as recycled as an aluminum can .  they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next  " pulp fiction "  .  this script should have been used to line a bird cage ,  not a movie .    oh and last but not least ,  a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow .    avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an std .
-1	i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie ,  really .  unhappily ,  i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it .  especially ,  when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic .  i think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time ,  so that was why i watched it .  don't get me wrong ,  i like humphrey bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors ,  but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion .  no really good plot ,  neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story .  well ,  not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres .  only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether 'bogey' and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another .  i think  " to have and have not "  is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the 1940s .
-1	or  " marlowe at sea "  .  yet another ridiculously overrated old film with bogey .  quite talky ,  too .  bogey basically plays the same character as in the marlow films ;  always in control of a situation ,  never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation ,  calls women  " slim "  and  " dames "  and other such nonsense ,  is the only  " real male "  i . e .  alpha male in the movie  ( the only other alpha male male being the head of gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male )  ,  and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction .  the character clichés are all here .  bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in  " casablanca "  ,  and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him ?  it doesn't ,  so he can't be a cynic ;  hawks wanted it both ways :  a character who is both the  " cool lone cynic "  and yet a well-meaning humanitarian .  i don't think so .  .  .  bacall does her non-chalant  " cool babe "  routine for the first time ,  and there are plenty of overrated ,  not all-too interesting so-called  " sexual innuendo "  exchanges between her and bogey ;  these dialogues sound silly by today's standards .   " just purse your lips and whistle .  .  .  "  .  a load of crap .  .  .  she was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older ,  and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day .  her bony face ,  with its sharp features ,  is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de havilland ,  the cuteness of a myrna loy ,  let alone the likability of an irene dunne .  bacall was more suited for playing vampires ,  not femme-fatales .   ( in real life she is very much like her face :  a hollywood bitch .  )  there is a scene in which bacall breaks into tears ;  very unsuitable for her character .  there are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready .   if you're interested in reading my  " biographies "  of bogart ,  bacall ,  huston ,  and other hollywood personalities ,  contact me by e-mail .
-1	that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days .   first of all ,  there is such a thing as the art of cinematography .  just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie .   i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder .  .  .   second ,  indie films are supposed to be about real people .  there's nothing real in this film .  none of the characters come across as being even remotely human .   what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how  " cool and edgy "  he is .   sorry ,  but this is not good writing ,  or good directing .   what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance .  hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted .  .  .   in any case ,  it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand .
-1	i enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second-run theatre in the early '80's .  i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings .  but to me ,  the cast was largely squandered ,  their personalities muffled by the masks ,  while the direction i think of as being unusually static ,  and the photography murky .  the rating jotted down at the time was a nought ,  which means  " not worth sitting through even once "  .   still ,  i too would jump at a chance to have a second look .
-1	this is one of those films that i could only sit through once .  charlotte henry is fine -- in fact ,  all the actors were fine .  the problem was in the script ,  the dialog ,  the direction ,  the editing ,  the sets and the special effects .  granted ,  this was 1933 ,  but it really creaked .  part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen ,  gary cooper ,  w . c .  fields and cary grant are not recognizable  ( there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming )  .  the movie just clumped along with no cohesion .  much of lewis carrols spirit ,  humor and continuity are missing .  what a pity !  it's such a great book .  i would recommend disney's 1951 version .
-1	a family moves into a old house in japan .  but there's a catch it's haunted  ( boo !  !  !  )  .  aw ,  didn't mean to make you jump .  it's only a review .  settle back down .  ahem ,  now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion .  this naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8 .  horrid acting .  horrid story .  but how bad can it be you ask ?  well it was so bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips .  it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on-screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder  ( yes ,  i know doug was in  " out of this world "  & not  " small wonder "  ,  but it's pretty much the same damn show ,  & i can hum the  " small wonder "  theme better )  there are movies that are so bad they're good .  this isn't one of those  where i saw it :  showtime beyond  my grade :  f-  eye candy :  mako hattori gets topless , susan george gets 2 love scenes  (  one nude ,  one just topless )
-1	this is a rotten movie . the cast seem to know just how bad it was . it starts badly and by the end is truly bad . the acting is woeful . the script could of been written on the spot . and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes . crap 1 out of 10
-1	i saw this film at a pre-release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills .  as i recall ,  the film's producers and director were in attendance ,  presumably to gage our reaction .   many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience ,  which would have been fine if it had been a comedy ,  but it was supposed to be a horror film .   if the audience wasn't scared ,  it seems the filmmakers were .  they delayed release for over a year .  out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it ;  as far as i can tell ,  they hadn't .  it was the same lousy movie ,  just a year older .   it almost qualifies as  " so bad ,  it's good ,  "  but it's slow-paced and boring .
-1	aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting ,  this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia .  i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a  " good movie .  "
-1	while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing ,  the execution is downright pathetic .  i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie .  i suppose i'll just number a few of them :    1 .  the acting  when you see that edward albert ,  doug mcclure ,  and susan george  ( and her teeth )  are the stars of your movie ,  you know you're in trouble ?  not that it matters much to me ,  but these are hardly a-list names .  susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy ,  but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen .  and in this movie ,  her acting is embarrassing .  as for the other two ,  the less said the better .   2 .  the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride . at disney world .  and ,  they are about as frightening .  and why did they have to be so obvious ?  subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells .   3 .  the plot  how predictable can one movie be ?  the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters .  if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes ,  you need to see more movies .   4 .  the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks ?  not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over ,  knocks on the door ,  and asks if you need help removing evil spirits .  absurd is a word that comes to mind .   5 .  everything else  it's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about .  i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture .  that's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie .   i'll stop .  you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned .  and ,  i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems .  be warned ,  this thing is horrible .
-1	film starts in 1840 japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide .  it's a very gory ,  bloody sequence .  then it jumps to present day .  .  . well 1982 to be precise .  ted  ( edward albert )  ,  wife laura  ( susan george )  and their annoying little kid move to japan for hubby's work .  they rent a house and--surprise !  surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place !  the three dead people are around as ghosts  ( the makeup is hysterically bad )  and make life hell for the family .   sounds ok--but it's really hopeless .  there's a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between .  there is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious !  they look so fake--i swear i saw the strings pulling one along--and they're muttering !  !  !  !  !  there's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes  ( probably just to show off george's body )  ,  another one about 40 minutes later  ( but that was necessary to the plot )  and a really silly exorcism towards the end .  the fight scene between albert and doug mcclure must be seen to be believed .   as for acting--albert was ok as the husband and mcclure was pretty good as a family friend .  but george--as always--is terrific in a lousy film .  she gives this film a much needed lift--but can't save it .  i'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing .  that aside ,  this is a very boring film .
-1	i don't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared .  this doesn't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn't tack on one of those happy endings .  story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto ,  japan so that ted fletcher  ( edward albert )  can write a book and he brings along his wife laura  ( susan george )  and their daughter amy  ( amy barrett )  .  their friend alex curtis  ( doug mcclure )  who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted .  about 140 years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide .  their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher's arrive it doesn't take long before strange things start happening .   *****spoiler alert*****  at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher's and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair .  meanwhile ,  ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help .  unfortunately the ghosts get ted ,  laura ,  and alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier .   this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them .  while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked .  first ,  it doesn't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons .  instead ,  it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts .  secondly ,  it has susan george in the cast !  i've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch .  also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular .  but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically .  this isn't a bad film but it's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two .  the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .
-1	dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred .    novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell .  the film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall .    one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned .  the monk recounts the history of the house  ( which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence )  and then the film simply cuts away to something else .  earlier the monk had offered to help .  well ,  where is the help ?  the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house ,  although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care .   there are some  ( probably )  unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts ,  i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing ,  but on the whole this is a forgettable dud .
-1	the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'kushiata kyoto ,  japan 1840' .  a young japanese trainee samurai named masanori  ( toshiya maruyama )  walks up the winding path to the house ,  inside waits otami  ( mako hattori )  with whom he is having an affair behind her husband ,  shugoro's  ( tsuiyuki sasaki as toshiyuki sasaki )  back who happens to be masanori's teacher .  shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other .  his honour destroyed the enraged samurai brutally murders both otami and masanori before committing suicide .  over a century later and ted fletcher  ( edward albert )  arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura  ( susan george )  and their young daughter amy  ( amy barrett )  .  their close friend alex curtis  ( doug mcclure )  who works for the american consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay ,  you don't need me to you where !  he jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted ,  to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts ,  at least for the time being that is .  almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode .  lights turn on and off by themselves ,  laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local zen monk  ( henry mitowa )  gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore ,  of course .  the spirits of otami ,  masanori and shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a majyo witches  ( tsuyako olajima )  curse put upon them .  but there may be a way they can break the curse ,  unfortunately for the fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage ,  daughter and possibly even their very lives .    directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film ,  ok to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it .  nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either .  the script by robert suhosky from the novel by james hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers ,  a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things .  there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get amy and her babysitter ,  noriko  ( mayumi umeda )  .  and there is a scene where the zen monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in ,  however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in ,  some exorcism !  one more thing ,  i think it was a bad idea to have doug mcclure who was 47 when he made this ,  try his hand at kung-fu and oriental sword fighting !  george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with mcclure ,  although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present .  apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood ,  gore or violence to speak about .  the 'transparent' ghost effects are ok but they ain't going to impress many people these days .  it's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in america ,  england or any western country without having to change a thing .  an ok time waster .
-1	raising victor vargas is just a bad film .  no amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact .   maybe peter sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current  " edgy film-making "  .  maybe he just doesn't know any better .  it's hard to tell .   what's not hard to tell is the result .  except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism ,  few will enjoy it .   i know i didn't .   do yourselves a favor and pass on this film .
-1	this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously .  it is a bit dated and the effects are lame ,  but it is so enjoyable .  there are giant crabs that attack a girl .  oh ,  and the crabs sing japanese .  it is amazingly bad .  and the ending ,  which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome .  predictable ,  but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat .  don't even give this film a chance and you will love it .  susan george is fun to watch and yes ,  she does appear naked .  her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with ,  but she does get attacked by giant crabs .  they are the size of large cats .  this is a 2 ,  but i love it .  as a movie ,  my god ,  but for entertainment ,  i give it a 7 .  did i mention there are giant crabs ?
-1	.  . it's this one !  very cool premise ,  right off the bat .   has an excellent first scene ,  gotta give credit where credit's due .   has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me :  whenever the ghosts appeared ,  which i really liked by the way ;  how it was done ,  how it looked .  .  . the only thing was the ghost's relationship .  because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different .   things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt ,  and the crab/spider scene was just not good .  but then the ending is actually very good !  sure ,  'the grudge' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai's and that's what i liked about this movie comparatively .   please ,  someone one with a tempered style remake this movie .   fans of 'silent rage' would absolutely love this movie .
-1	at the beginning of the film ,  you might double-check the dvd cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times ,  but no worries .  it's not  " memoirs of a geisha "  that you purchased ;  just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be .  still ,  the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie ,  as it shows how in the year 1840 a samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery .  he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri  ( ritual suicide through disembowelment )  .  cut to present day ,  when the american ambassador in japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago .  from then onwards ,  this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional .  let's start with the good aspects ,  namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all-time favorite british horror wench  ( well ,  together with britt eckland ,  linda hayden and ingrid pitt )  .  the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent ,  imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter .  the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff .  the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress !  in this  " possessed "  state ,  she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests .  so ,  strictly spoken ,  it's not really  " evil "  that dwells in the house ;  just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands !  obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening ,  especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in  " ghostbusters "  .   " the house where evil dwells "  is probably the least scary ghost movie ever .  throughout most of the running time ,  you'll be wondering whether director kevin connor  ( who nevertheless made the excellent horror films  " motel hell "  and  " from beyond the grave "  )  intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top ,  like  " motel hell "  maybe .  but then again ,  everyone in the cast continues to speak his/her lines with a straight and sincere face ,  so i guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed .   " the house where evil dwells "  is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning .  i am fully aware of how shallow it sounds ,  but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights .  well ,  those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders  ( or are they crabs ?  )  in the daughter's bedroom .  how totally random and irrelevant was that ?  if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation ,  make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep .   trivia note for horror buffs :  keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba .
-1	this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director .   the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare ,  i . e .  the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to !  besides ,  it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as ,  generally ,  the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way ,  such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup !    at one point ,  an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually ,  he's called upon to exorcise the premises .  however ,  history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure ,  possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors ,  engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death !  at the end of the day ,  this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but ,  in no way ,  essential viewing .
-1	giant crabs cursing in japanese ?  what was in that drink ?  a terrible movie ,  but laughable .  i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around .  drink much beer before you see this movie .
-1	from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb ,  this movie seems to get ragged on a lot ,  but i didn't think it was that bad .  i've seen much worse ,  actually .    " the house where evil dwells "  is a ghost story about a husband and his wife ,  ted and laura fletcher ,  and their daughter ,  amy ,  who move into an old house in japan .  little do they know ,  a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover ,  and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword .  as strange things happen in the house ,  the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living ,  and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back .   i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance ,  from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story .  it was routine ,  and it was corny ,  but i've seen worse in my day .  the ghost sequences were a little over-done ,  we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family ,  and take over their bodies .  to be honest ,  the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland .  i may be mistaken ,  but after watching this ,  it seemed to me that the japanese horror film  " ju-on :  the grudge "  and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little .  the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place ,  ghostly activity ,  curses put on the home ,  etc .  but i may be wrong .   to sum it up ,  this is a pretty corny ghost story .  don't go out of your way to see it ,  but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot .  4/10 .
-1	director kevin connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead doug mcclure ,  re-team in this ghost story set in japan .  they had been moderately successful together in the 1970's ,  with the likes of 'the land that time forgot'  ( 1975 )  ,  'at the earth's core'  ( 1976 )  etc .  without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though ,  the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way .   the film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century ,  with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide .  a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted & laura ,  visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place .   no surprises as to what happens next ,  with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex  ( mcclure )  assuming the role of the wife's lover .   everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant ,  to an inevitable  (  but surprisingly downbeat  )  conclusion .  main points of interest are two feeble decapitations  (  'the omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece  )  ,  and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky susan george .  the first is a long 'don't look now' inspired piece with her hubby ,  complete with piano music ;  the second a much shorter  ( probably at her insistence )  entanglement with mcclure ,  both looking pretty uncomfortable .  anyway ,  every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost .   overall i can't decide whether 'the house where evil dwells' is rubbish ,  watchable rubbish ,  or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way .  if you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all ,  but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort .   best scene - in any other film the big ,  black ,  tree-climbing ,  japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show .  they are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene ,  where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup .  on seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is  (  !  !  !  !  )  ,  to be told beef and vegetable ,  before uttering the immortal line  " ugh - there's an awful face in my soup "  .  if this wasn't enough the reply is  " c'mon ,  eat your soup for daddy .  "  laurel & hardy rest in piece .
-1	i just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about .  so here's what my reactions to it are .  it's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors .  the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists .  this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film .  however ,  the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all .  it just bored me .  this movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes .  all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time ,  like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below .   ************contains spoiler************ i find the rape scenes quite tame .  i don't know if i have watched the cut or uncut version ,  if there is actually such a version .  i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot .  here's a list on top of my mind .   why don't the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are .  that would be an excellent time .   why don't they just gang rape her ,  instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer's ordeal by such a long time .  it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way .   i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house .  maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles .   these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right ,  they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job .   why didn't jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left ?  which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind ,  especially for someone who is a writer .    why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive ?   i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him .  ************************ends spoiler************  but hey ,  this movie is not without its merits ,  camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer ,  `why me ?  why me ,  i didn't even c^m !  !  ! '
-1	i've seen the gator bait films ,  and this is almost exactly the same thing as those .  a woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them .  the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones  ( although not very far )  is that the sexual content is not glorified .  there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film ,  but not for a second is it ever sexy .  some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive ,  but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge .   this is a weak film ,  it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers .  i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral ,  but i was glad to see that ,  since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead ,  it was not meant to pass off as a t&a film .   b-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality ,  and while i spit on you grave is unmistakably a b-movie and contains more than its share of nudity ,  the nudity does not drive the plot .  on the other hand ,  the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists .  these men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the gator bait films ,  and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them ,  but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind ,  but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve .    the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks .  oddly ,  the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity  ( although not by much )  ,  but it is by far the most painful to watch .  we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible  ( it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller ,  staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord )  ,  but again ,  this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with .    ( spoilers )  you know that this is all the movie means to do ,  since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed .  the woman does not live happily ever after ,  she doesn't write her book ,  she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place ,  she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks .  but hey ,  what more did you expect ?   oh ,  and did you read the tagline ?  if you decide to waste your time watching this ,  try and find any man getting broken or burned .  i was really looking forward to those
-1	this  " film "  is one of the most dreadful things i have ever seen .   please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction .   shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as  " direction "  ,  which this film needed in droves .  not that the writing was all the wonderful ,  rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way  ( the pseudo-documentary  " style "  prized by those who don't know how to direct )  .   this film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making  ( which is most of them )  .   just terrible .  it says a lot about sundance and what it's become that victor vargas was showcased there .
-1	i'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot ,  anyway .  i've seen several reviewers call isoyg an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement ,  and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims .   first of all ,  what do we see on the cover of this movie ?  that's right :  a shapely woman's behind .  whether it was zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and i absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point .  the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic  ( everything but actual penetration is shown )  that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it .   the rape ( s )  in the film is uncomfortable ,  brutal and hard to watch .  there's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light ,  but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes ,  none .  there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed  ( mere moments before he's murdered )  so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level .  really ,  it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb  ( caligula ,  cannibal ferox ,  etc .  )  that it attracts only the exploitation crowd .   finally ,  a few reviewers have commended zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack .  but considering how inept everything else in the film is  ( acting ,  script ,  etc .  )  i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing .   i'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg .  i'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties .  in fact ,  i'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films .  however ,  it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs ,  just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum ,  mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll .   this is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but i'm telling you ,  the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation .
-1	okay ,  you have :   penelope keith as miss herringbone-tweed ,  b . b . e .   ( backbone of england .  )  she's killed off in the first scene - that's right ,  folks ;  this show has no backbone !   peter o'toole as ol' colonel cricket from the first war and now the emblazered lord of the manor .   joanna lumley as the ensweatered lady of the manor ,  20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous  ( brit spelling ,  not mine )  enough to have a toy-boy on the side .  it's alright ,  they have col .  cricket's full knowledge and consent  ( they guy even comes 'round for christmas !  )  still ,  she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age  ( what a gal !  )   david mccallum as said toy-boy ,  equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze .  pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story ,  so she gave him a hush-hush job at the circus .   and finally :   susan hampshire as miss polonia teacups ,  venerable headmistress of the venerable girls' boarding-school ,  serving tea in her office with a dash of deep ,  poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation .  her best bit of advice :   " i've only been to nancherrow  ( the local stately home of england )  once .  i thought it was very beautiful but ,  somehow ,  not part of the real world .  "  well ,  we can't say they didn't warn us .   ah ,  susan - time was ,  your character would have been running the whole show .  they don't write 'em like that any more .  our loss ,  not yours .   so - with a cast and setting like this ,  you have the re-makings of  " brideshead revisited ,  "  right ?   wrong !  they took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well .  after all ,  acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is  ( you name another !  )   first warning sign :  lots and lots of backlighting .  they get around it by shooting outdoors -  " hey ,  it's just the sunlight !  "   second warning sign :  leading lady cries a lot .  when not crying ,  her eyes are moist .  that's the law of romance novels :  leading lady is  " dewy-eyed .  "   henceforth ,  leading lady shall be known as l . l .   third warning sign :  l . l .  actually has stars in her eyes when she's in love .  still ,  i'll give emily mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes  ( i wonder  .  did they use contacts ?  )   and lastly ,  fourth warning sign :  no on-screen female character is  " mrs .  "  she's either  " miss "  or  " lady .  "   when all was said and done ,  i still couldn't tell you who was pursuing whom and why .  i couldn't even tell you what was said and done .   to sum up :  they all live through world war ii without anything happening to them at all .   ok ,  at the end ,  l . l .  finds she's lost her parents to the japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic .  meanwhile  ( there's always a  " meanwhile ,  "  )  some young guy l . l .  had a crush on  ( when ,  i don't know )  comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by lady of the manor  ( must be some street if she's going to find him there .  )  both war casualties are whisked away to recover at nancherrow  ( somebody has to be  " whisked away "  somewhere in these romance stories !  )   great drama .
-1	with knightly and o'tool as the leads ,  this film had good possibilities ,  and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly ,  maybe some tension .  but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants .  it was of course totally superficial ,  beautiful english country and seaside or not . the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film ,  when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older ,  instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part .  they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast ,  and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements .
-1	quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom .   a group of top quality actors ,  in the main well cast  ( with a couple of notable exceptions )  ,  who give pretty good performances .  penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana .  all do well with the scripts they were given .   so much for the good .  the average would include the sets .  nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book ,  although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it .  it is clear then that the dower house is far too big .  in the later parts ,  the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk ,  presumably to save money ,  although with a little imagination i have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon .   now to the bad .  the screenplay .  this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it .  edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives ,  blinded .  he makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why ?  ?  loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear  ( less emotional than brief encounter )  .  gus ,  a man besotted and passionately in love ,  is prepared to give up his love without complaint .  walter  ( mudge in the book )  turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man .  jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak .  aunt biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification .  the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with jess who has a fear of armed soldiers .  whilst miss mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful ,  i could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward .  the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson .  the word limit prevents me from continuing the list .   there is a sequel  ( which i lost all interest in watching after this nonsense )  and i wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story .  it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book ;  presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased .
-1	being a filmmaker myself ,  and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour ,  i thought i was in for a treat when i took home  " my wrongs .  .  .  "   ( not that the dvd cover gives anything away ,  instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director ,  chris morris ,   " a short film including scenes "  )  .  i should have known better really ,  and avoided this insipid  ( and often offensive )  piece of twoddle .   the scene in the church is repulsive to watch  ( especially since we are all too familiar with morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious tv series ,  brass eye )  and serves no purpose other than to shock .  how this film is labelled a comedy i will never understand .   the runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle  ( having been a runner myself ,  it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process )  ,  however this is sadly not the case here .  instead ,  we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film ,  before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs .  this is all very interesting ,  but not worth a single frame of celluloid .   to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement .  it relies far too heavily upon its heightened style ,  at the expense of plot ,  character and dialogue ,  leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled .  its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated .   the film does have its moments of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism ,  but ultimately ,  it fails to convince ,  to entertain ,  to enlighten and just ends up being irritating .  if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking ,  i strongly recommend  " franz kafka's it's a wonderful life "  ,  by peter capaldi .
-1	simply not the quality i expected from morris  ( love brass eye and blue jam )  .  this is very much like a not so bad student film .  what concerns me ,  in all this is why did it win a bafta ?  ?  ?  morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity'  ( ayn rand )  in much of his work  ( nathan barley )  and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining !    i just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle  ( the humanity of terrorism - four lions )  that he isn't going to cock that up ,  wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena .
-1	there's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets .  it's just that some are better than others .  this is very poor .  the acting is awful ,  the script dire ;  and the special effects overrated .   why does hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt ?  and why have they made a sequel ?
-1	one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying ,  it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked .  one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they  ( the yuppies )  are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art .  while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning ,  i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner .  if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home ,  i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies .
-1	enough is enough .  .  . sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead .  the first tremors movie was great .  the second one was ridiculous .  the third one was nauseating .  the tv series was depressingly awful .  and this movie just drives the stake deeper .   basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry ,  now we have the series set in the wild west ,  in the 1800's ,  and they fight graboids .  like a rehash of the first one ,  they have to learn how to beat them all over again .  mildly entertaining i suppose .  otherwise this straight-to-video release ,  just like tremors 2 and 3 ,  is just going way too far .  oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place .  .  . did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event ?  i think something like this would be history-making ,  so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared .    movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy .  avoid this garbage .
-1	dear dear dear dear dear .  .  . me !  i had the strength to see it through .  .  .  but why ?  !   the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good .  but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing .  this was some kind of tremors for kids .  i can't believe this movie was made at all .  . seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind  ( for kids )  and they just did whatever they could with it .   what audience is this movie for ?  i can only think of 12-14 year olds .  if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie .  it's not only slow ,  but it's so utterly boring .  the characters are overacted  ( not just a little either )  and so stereotyped it's fun for a while .  . but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen .  you know everything that is going to happen too ,  cause yes .  .  . you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids .  i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced .  it's so bad .  . so wrong .  . so .  .  . crap .   but ok ,  we did get a laugh now and then .  not just at the silly plot holes ,  but some scenes where worth a replay or two .  .  . or one scene that is ,  where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys .  . it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly .  still makes me grin when i think about it .  but that only happened one more time sadly .  . and that's when the  " badass "  gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully .  .  . that and one comment  " they spring from the ground like some demonic trout !  "  at this point we where almost crying with laughter .  but after that .  . nothing could ever top that .  .  (  ?  )  .  . so it's pretty much downhill from there .    so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting .  if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie .  .  . he's either a  " plant "  ,  vegetable or someone very evil .  this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far .  looking forward to seeing tremors 3 ,  it's bound to be box office hit compared to this .  .  . this .  .  . *goosebumps* no .  . i'll leave it at that .
-1	i can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 !  it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring ,  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long ,  long time .   in a no-budget way ,  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck .   this film should be avoided at all costs .  it's one of those  " festival films "  that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it  " different "  ,  therefore good .   bad film-making is not  " different "  ,  it's just bad film-making .
-1	well .  .  . tremors i ,  the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch .  however ,  they proceeded to make tremors ii and iii .  trust me ,  those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one ,  i mean ,  ass blasters ?  ?  ?  now ,  only god himself is capable of answering the question  " why in gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie ?  "  tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie ,  in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie ,  for it lives up to more than that .  as i attempted to sit though it ,  i noticed that my eyes started to bleed ,  and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me .  did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie  ( with the exact same occurrences )  any better ?  honestly ,  i would never suggest buying this movie ,  i mean ,  there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well .
-1	just a few words .  .  .  .  this movie really sucks .  it's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot .  it's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii .  don't waste your time watching this crap ,  even if you like the tremors movies .
-1	this ,  the direct-to-video death rattle of the tremors series ,  features sixty inspired seconds  ( sawblade :  you'll know it when you see it )  and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at .  tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget .  that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence ,  tops .  the lackluster ,  cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long .  only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through ,  much less enjoy this film .  if you aren't among them- don't bother .
-1	the fourth  " tremors "  feature goes back in time ,  to the year 1889 .   " the legend begins "  in the small city of  " perfection "  ,  which was then  " rejection ,  nevada "  .  as the story begins ,  seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly  " graboids "  .  some of the characters in the present-day  " tremors "  films have ancestors ,  both figurative and literal ,  in the past .  most obvious is the ever-returning michael gross  ( as hiram gummer )  .  unlike his descendant ,  mr .  gross is inept with firearms ;  so ,  he hires gunslinger billy drago  ( as  " black hand "  kelly )  to shoot 'em up some  " dirt dragons "  .   this one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past .  it's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster  " graboids "  .  these tamer  " dirt dragons "  are nowhere near as terrorizing as their  " tremors "   ( 1990 )  counterparts .  consequently ,  in this film ,  the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground ,  which would not have happened in the original movie .  and ,  it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly ,  when gross temporarily decides to leave town .  why so helpless ?  why didn't brent roam  ( as juan pedilla )  immediately rally the people to fight without gross ?  disappointing .   **** tremors 4 :  the legend begins  ( 2004 )  s . s .  wilson ~ michael gross ,  brent roam ,  billy drago
-1	warning :  this review contains minor spoilers .   well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas .  i'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare .  tremors 4 :  the legends begins ,  however ,  is a very dull movie .  where the heck are the graboids ?  ?  ?    due to the relative lack of graboids through the first 90 minutes i'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  " character study "  .  unfortunately there isn't one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago's character who is given too few lines ,  too little to do and in the end too little screen time .  what saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer .  whenever there wasn't any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch .  however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .    on the plus side when the graboids  ( dirt dragons in this movie )  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets .   i was impressed when i saw that tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long .  pretty good for straight to video .  but after watching it i'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long .  there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn't further the plot any .  was there a rush to get this movie made ?  i think not ,  more time could have and should have been spent on the script .   i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors 4 packaged for sale with .  .  .  . tremors !  !  !  what luck i thought ,  pay for #4 get #1 for free .  well after watching tremors 4 i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free ,  i can't imagine paying a single dime for tremors 4 .  for fans of the series it's best to forget that tremors 4 :  the legend begins even exists .   tremors 4 :  the legend begins rates a 3 out of 10 .
-1	i found tremors 4 : the legend begins ,  to be dull and boring . all the action scenes were stupid . the so called  " graboids "  are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat ,  if not smaller . the acting was horrendous ,  and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga ,  because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed ,  the story is so dumb and useless . also ,  if you want to tell a story way back in time ,  make sure you use the same actor ( michael gross )  ,  to be someone in the past ,  when he's someone in the present in the other tremor movies . geez .  .  . if you haven't seen this film ,  don't waste your time . stick to tremors ,  1 ,  2 ,  and 3 ,  for a good time . this film however ,  make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .
-1	if fassbinder has made a worse film ,  i sure don't want to see it !  anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this ,  to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like  " the bitter tears of petra von kant "  .  this film bogs down with so much arty ,  quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an  " art-film "  .  the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance .  but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter .  these are the only moments that display any real human emotion ,  and prove that at the core of this horrible film ,  there was an excellent film struggling to free itself .  what a waste .
-1	as if the storyline wasn't depressing enough ,  this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher .  weird stuff .  then there's the core premise of the hero/heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he's besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl .  is this person a psycho ,  a masochist ,  just a doomed queen who takes things too far ?  and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have ?  just that he didn't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly .  he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did ,  but it's really really so hard to empathize .  such sad and unusual self destruction .  was it supposed to be funny ?  what was it all about really ?
-1	this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues .  that is no exaggeration :  you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it .   i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin/elvira suicides at the end ,  but instead of this ,  in every scene somebody is trying to explain :   " when he was young ,  this happened .  .  .  "  and  " he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there .  .  .  "  ,  etc .   soon in the movie ,  erwin/elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute  ( certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat )  ,  and while telling her the story of elvira's life ,  fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other .  it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying .  of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of  " i have suffered much in my life ,  and am about to die "  .   in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something ,  erwin/elvira encounters a former lover ,  that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys  ( as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality )  is that he recognizes elvira .   there are some interesting shots and ideas ,  i must admit  ( such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin )  ,  but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder's self- indulgence .
-1	it's funny .  i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting ,  while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film .  for me ,  it ranges from great to crap--without much in the middle .  i know he has a lot of fans among the  " sophisticated "  ,  but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype .  from my point of view  ( and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this )  ,  he made too many movies too quickly and was too self-indulgent .  his gay or gender-bending films  ( like this one )  tend to be really bad--sloppily done ,  sometimes quite boring  ( such as querelle and the bitter tears of petra von kant )  and sometimes just gross  ( like this film )  .  couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender-confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered ?  show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic--then ,  maybe ,  i'd care about the films .    i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good .
-1	how many more of those fake  " slice of life "  movies need to be made ?  hopefully not too many .   raising victor vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood .  nothing wrong with that in general .  what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly  " edgy "  hollywood independent production .   it's supposed to be  " real "  so left shake the camera  " documentary style "  ,  except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose .  .  .   it's  " edgy "  so let's not waste any time lighting the film .   it's  " hip "  ,  so let's have the children use swear words like al pacino in scarface .  .  .   and so on ,  and so forth .  all that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the  " rarefied "  indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .
-1	this film is in the mandingo & drum type  they were both dreadful but they are 100% better than this tripe ,   badly acted & made oliver reed is the main name & eartha kitt also is in it .  tis a pity .  rating is 1/2* about as low as yu can get  as always  jay harris
-1	there are no reasons to watch this movie .  should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill  ( like that would ever happen )  then get this movie from the video shop  ( if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie .  be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone  ( in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing )  .  oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure .  but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - claudia udy showing her chest !  sadly no other reason than that !
-1	this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the  " seinfeld "  show !  patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here .  oliver reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all .  warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him .  eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film .  if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him .  then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff .  no real political message like the film  " burn "  but just another contrived plot device to move the story along .  incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back !  i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad .  the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable .  very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel .
-1	2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous .   i thought with a cast of james woods ,  cathy bates ,  randy quaid ,  lou gossett ,  jr .  ,  and henry thomas - how could it miss .  i was wrong .   i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble .  i'd long suspected sam s .  of being kind of nuts ,  this film ,  based on his play ,  confirms it .   this is the kind of artsy b . s .  that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote .  however ,  for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash ,  there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie .   you haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch .  pa is crazy ,  ma is crazy ,  the son is crazy and the daughter is ,  oh yeah ,  crazy .  they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush ,  especially the teenage daughter .   in addition to the above ,  as if that weren't enough ,  the plot--and it's so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of alaska .   ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm .  as it turns out so is pa .  now i don't claim to be a real estate expert ,  but the last time i checked ,  property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold .  if only one of them owned the property ,  then the other could not legally sell it ,  so it would be pointless for that person to do so .  mr .  shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact ,  and therefore ,  his plot does not work .   not that anything else was really working anyway .   the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity ,  and i can't imagine why anyone would want to .
-1	before seeing this movie ,  i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done .  now it's everything-minus-one .  james woods is pathetic .  .  . not his character ,  his acting .  someone should've told him that  " poor "  is not synonymous with dirty ,  nor ignorant ,  nor cliche .  ditto for randy quaid's stereotyping .  the only redeeming feature is henry thomas ,  who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess .  if you enjoy the country ,  you'll enjoy the scenery .  that's the best i can give it .   i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films ,  but this is simply terrible .
-1	this would've been a *great* silent film .  the acting really is good ,  at least in a look ma ,  i'm doing really big acting !  sort of way .   everything is huge .  every line is profound !  every scene is shattered by human tragedy !   mostly ,  i felt like gagging .  yet ,  like any train wreck ,  i couldn't tear my eyes away .  this dialogue might've worked on the stage ,  although i doubt it .  on the screen ,  it was cluttered ,  haphazard ,  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work .   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge ,  heaping doses ,  you *might* enjoy the movie .  be prepared to wait ,  however .  for all that melodrama ,  this thing sure plods along at its own pace .   this script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves .  it simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera .   imdb does us a great disservice ,  at times ,  when it uses its goofy computer-controlled  " weighted score "  .  curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 .   character-driven fiction is great ,  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution ,  it isn't character development !  your characters must have a motivation .  being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development .  that's a plot contrivance .   stay away from this movie .  or at the very least ,  watch it muted .  perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do .   oh ,  and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film ,  you see james woods in all his dangly male  " look-at-me ,  i'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man "  glory .   don't say you weren't warned .
-1	this is not a children's movie !  !  !   this movie is like a  " bad acid trip "  for kids under the age of 5 .  for a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me  " why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth "  or  " why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits ?  "  .   ( and that wasn't the worst of it )  .  we stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done .  intensely morbid ,  oppressive ,  violent .  fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing .  whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges .   .  .  .   ( go ahead censure me ,  my conscience is clear .  )  .
-1	probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this :   1 .  they might not have read the book .  2 .  they might enjoy gore and violence in a film .  3 .  they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence .  4 .  people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book .  5 .  there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here .   the only thing i liked about this film is the song  " 'bright eyes "  .   if perchance ,  you happen to be one of those people who has read the book ,  enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence ,  you are sure not to like this .  otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this .   like in the book ,  a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come .  only a few rabbits - including his brother hazel - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live .  .  .
-1	ok ,  i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a  " classic "  and a standard part of most people's childhood ,  but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 ,  i must admit :  i really hated it .   we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it ,  and many people who whimpered at the very words  " watership down " - their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it .  to be honest ,  i wish i hadn't bothered .  i gave it the benefit of the doubt ;  generally i don't like to stop watching a film half way through .  this was an exception .  it was really ,  really ,  excruciatingly ,  sickeningly dull .  this film was possibly the slowest thing i've ever watched  ( imagine a doped-up snail in space )  ,  and really didn't  " do it "  for me .  the art was alright ;  the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee ,  yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced .   i'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline ;  basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area .  generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment ,  it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across .  for me ,  i kind of wished that they would get gassed ,  not because i'm a horrible sadistic person ,  but because the characters were uninspiring ,  annoying ,  dull and generally quite rude  ( oh i'm so terribly english )  .  i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film ,  and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened ,  and even that was a terrible anticlimax .   if i were to praise it in any way ,  i'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning .  maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy ,  but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature .  the musical score was not bad ,  too .   so ,  to conclude ,  this film is pretty poor .  i couldn't watch it the whole way through ,  or i'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom .  granted ,  it isn't  " torque "  bad ,  but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes ,  so i've given it a 2/10 .   hope this helps .
-1	i saw this movie as a very young girl  ( i'm 27 now )  and it scared me witless for years .  i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to  ( obviously )  the violence .  my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie .  i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it  ; 0 )  i am currently reading the book  ( out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic )  and it is really a great story .  however i don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon .  ever .  well ,  maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way .  gives me a little heart palpitation every time .  yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids ,  read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content .  not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there  ; 0 )
-1	first of all ,  write the script on a napkin .  who needs more than that ?  after all we're not a hollywood film .   then get amateur actors .  it will be good for the festival hype .  after all ,  who needs people who have spent years honing their craft ?  then ,  hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light .  you see ,  if it's well-lit ,  it won't look  " real "  and the festival people won't like it .  who needs to have professional level photography anyway ?  then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator .  it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for  " reality "  and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people ,  critics and a small sliver of the audience who over-intellectualize will scream  " genius "  because they won't believe this was just complete amateur-hour .   once you've done that ,  buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance .   what a sad waste .
-1	firstly ,  i am not easily scared by .  .  .  anything except for my few phobias ,  but this movie is absolutely horrific .  this is not appropriate for children at all !  i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i .  couldn't believe how gory it was for a children's movie ,  bunnies being brutally murdered !  it's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g .  i recommend being over 8 to see this .  but don't get me wrong ,  it was probably a good movie if i wasn't scarred mentally as a child .  i cannot believe a parent would allow a ,  let's say ,  4 year old child to watch this .  it's just to intense and complicated ,  not to forget gory ,  for young kids .  i'm wayy over 4 and i was shocked by the violence .  i don't recommend
-1	so .  .  .  it's really sexist ,  and classist ,  and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie ,  like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change .  well ,  he certainly changed his tune ,  and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit .  what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers .  the end of the movie does not make her a hero ,  it makes the whole thing sad .  and its sad that people think it makes her a hero .  perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away .  positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience .  yuck .
-1	i should love this movie  .  the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me  .  the movie makes working class people look low and cheap  . the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy  .  barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family  .  i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it . again the acting was very very good and worth watching  .  i really don't like the story line  .  just a personal preference  . thank you
-1	this movie is great ,  mind you - but only in the way it tells a very bad story .  stella is so terribly crude ,  and never learns better .  her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded .  neither ever learns better .  is this realistic ?  somehow ,  stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress ,  yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down ?  i don't think so .  stella is a good woman ,  and a very good mother .  giving up herself ,  so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting .    much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two ,  enjoying a player piano ,  dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority .   " i can't have our child living this way !  "  spare me .    this story tells me one thing :  that the unwashed working class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes .  and that is simply a load of hogwash .
-1	i hate this movie .  it is a horrid movie .  sean young's character is completely unsympathetic .  her performance is wooden at best .  the storyline is completely predictable ,  and completely uninteresting .  i would never recommend this film to anyone .  it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see .
-1	well ,  they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied .  i don't know if stella james  ( sean young )  qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac ,  but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men .  she's still exploring ,  trying to find  " more data "  so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it ,  though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now .   ( i can't agree ,  however ,  with anyone who says young is too old for the role .  if she is ,  we should all age so nicely .  )  for the most part this film left me cold ,  though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see .  and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut , ' at least something happens in this one .
-1	did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did ?  the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last .  oh my god .  it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy .  not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been .  most reviews have read have been glowing but i really can't understand why .  i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought  " no ,  they would never do that ,  that's far too lame .  "  i can hardly stand it .  i feel so unsatisfied .  i think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own .  someone please .  change my mind .  i want to love this .  so bad .  someone tell me why i'm wrong .  great show .  terrible ending .
-1	the first half was ok ,  but the last half really ,  really disappointed .  it's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending ,  and it really showed .  whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this .  i really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort .  when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake ,  it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn .  they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama ,  so i started watching again .  but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel ,  same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .
-1	there are many good things about the new bsg :  there's the multiple cylon roles for model 8 and 6 ,  for example ,  which the two actresses played superbly .  there's the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica  (  " my ship will not be networked ,  over my dead body !  "  )  also ,  all the space battles ,  the special effects  ( even though the seasoned sci-fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all )  the darkness of the characters ,  their essentially flawed nature .   that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish .   yes ,  the first part ,  the scenes in space ,  the raid on the cylons and all that was very good .  but the mushy ending ?  i always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden ,  so i never know how much time is left until the end .  so for me it was a special kind of torture ,  to see the end happen over and over again .  every time i thought ,  oh this is the final scene ,  the final shot ,  i got one more .  every frakking character got its complete ending !  that wasn't really necessary .   what really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all :  the young roslin scenes .  why is important for us to know that :  {a} she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} that she has a one night stand with a former pupil/student ?  what does that bring to the story ?  where was the linkage ?  now ,  i'm all for a more european-ish style approach ,  and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows ,  and all that ,  but this was just ridiculous .  this didn't bring anything meaningful to the story .   also ,  i've seen the  " last frakkin special "  and in it ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot :  he couldn't come up with a good ending for the story ,  so  .  .  .  .  he just didn't !  it's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be .  the whole  " this was thousands of years in the past "  idea ,  the mitochondrial eve thing ,  was also used in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy ,  and believe you me ,  there are a lot of bsg watchers who know that particular h2g2 storyline .  and speaking of hera ,  now there's a storyline that was not worked out well ,  at all .  instead we get roslin is doing her former pupil who's 20 years younger .  don't get me wrong ,  i'm all for older women with younger men .  the more power to them .  but this  .  .  .  just made no sense .   all in all ,   ( the writing in )  this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be .  that goes even moreso for the last episode .  i hope lost and 24 do better ,  with their series finales .
-1	i loved the first season .  the quality went down a little bit in the second season ,  which however had a great middle  ( pegasus !  )  .  third season was fairly novel and original and was ok .  fourth season started going downhill fast ,  because they never even began giving us any explanations ,  when by now we were really starting to need them .  what the hell was the cylon plan ?  why were there two cylon factions ?  what was the point of angel-kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth-1 ?  what kind of a past did the last five cylons have ,  and how did they survive ,  or were they reincarnations ?  questions everywhere ,  answers nowhere .   and then comes the end .  earth-2  ( our earth )  in the past .  well ,  okay .  but destroying the fleet ?  !  giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life ,  and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet ?  !  that's not only anti-science ,  it's anti-reason and anti-life .  and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a . i .  that ruins everything .  it is without vision ,  without hope for a grander future for humanity ,  and it is antithetical to proper science fiction .  and don't even get me started on the angels !  religious claptrap of the worst kind !  the ultimate disappointment !  !   the whole  " all this has happened before and will happen again "  thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series ,  not just to earth as we know it .  making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius .  frakkin shame .   1 out of 10 .
-1	horrible ending - and i can't believe moore spent a year coming up with it .  smacks of l .  ron hubbard and dianetitcs ,  which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks .  this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3 . 5 years .  now ,  the first 1 . 5 hours were action packed ,  though absurd in the premise ,  and then it deteriorated into a slow ,  painful ,  sophomoric dissolution of the series .  unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was .  were we to think more deeply ?  if i wanted a lesson in a-materialism ,  i would reread daniel quinn's ishmael .  absurd to think 38k people would give up everything for a  " fresh start "  .  absurd to throw in a disappearing kara ,  and a reappearing baltar and six .  absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve .  just absurd .
-1	the fight scenes were great .  loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side .  it was the ending that i hated .  i was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back .  but to travel all that way just to start over ?  are you kidding me ?  38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise ,  they abandon technology ?  no way .  sure they were eating paper and rationing food ,  but that is over .  they can live like humans again .  they only have one good doctor .  what are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth .  .  .  yea right .  no one would have made that choice .
-1	what a bad ,  bad film !  !  !  i can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious ,  amateurish excuse for a real movie !  !  i left the theater before the end ,  stunned by how bad the direction and camera-work of that movie were !  !  and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry .   at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film-making than anything else .   avoid at all costs .  you'll want your time back !  i know i did .
-1	did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 + 2 ?  god was behind everything ?  what has god got to do with sci-fi ?  god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something .  in fact ,  this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper ,  how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 ,  why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head ,  why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head ,  etc .  so they explain it with  " angels "  or just don't explain it at all .   the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through .  for example ,  why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl  ( hera )  ,  particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue ?  because they found out the location of the cylon base ?  that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives .  and how did anders know the location ?  and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war ?  it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment .   the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series .  feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word' .  forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot ,  the important message the writers wanted to get across is :  don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction ;  god is your ultimate salvation  ( tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment )  .   imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no  " force "  .  .  .  instead ,  a jedi actually gets his power from jesus .  then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks .  would this be a good ending ?  no it frakken' wouldn't .
-1	with these people faking so many shots ,  using old footage ,  and gassing animals to get them out ,  not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors ,  what's to believe ?  old film of countries is nice ,  but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films .  i know ,  racism is ok in these old films ,  but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility .  portrayed as fliers ,  they never flew their planes ,  martin johnson was an ex-vaudevillian ,  used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties ,  denying his wife's apparent depression ,  using her as a cute prop ,  all this makes these films unbearable .  they were by no means the first to travel to these lands ,  or the first to write about them .  he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer ,  but that's about it .
-1	the 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world ,  with an emphasis on wild animals ,  exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures .  despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place ,  and then bringing 'em back alive  ( with the film footage )  ,  such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features  .  .  .  because there were no expensive sets ,  costumes ,  or high-priced movie stars .   the most successful makers of such films  ( artistically and financially )  were the team of martin e .  johnson and his wife osa ,  who made several documentaries  ( sometimes with blatantly staged events )  in africa and asia .  the johnsons' safari films were extremely popular ,  inspiring several parodies  .  .  .  most notably wheeler & woolsey's  " so this is africa "  ,  in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs .  johnson-martini  ( instead of martin e .  johnson ,  geddit ?  )  .  although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time ,  the johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour .  viewed from our own more enlightened  ( i hope )  standpoint ,  this is a serious flaw in the johnsons' documentaries :  there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife .   one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson .  ten years younger than her husband ,  she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter .  while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir ,  osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co-produced with her husband .   'congorilla' is probably the best of the johnsons' films .  the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 .  the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting ,  although these suffer from the johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien .   the best  ( and funniest )  scene in 'congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women .   ( the dance is the black bottom ,  no less  .  .  .  the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton ,  the conjoined twins .  )  wearing jodhpurs ,  riding boots ,  and a pith helmet ,  osa johnson starts scat-singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women .  meanwhile ,  they just stand there staring at her ,  apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish .  it's a very funny scene ,  but it has unpleasant undertones .  osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans :  the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration  ( using natural rhythm ,  i guess )  because it's in their blood ,  or something .   i'll rate 'congorilla' 4 points out of 10 .  this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade .
-1	admirably odd ,  though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome .  robert altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight .  some of the cinematography is evocative ,  shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide ,  and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort's vision of a  " mother bird "   ( imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her !  )  .  in the lead ,  bud cort is--once again ,  after  " harold & maude " --a true original ;  not off-putting like ,  say ,  michael j .  pollard ,  cort manages to be geeky ,  wacky and inoffensive ,  a tough act to pull off .  unfortunately ,  this is one of altman's misfires .  he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else ,  but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward .  ** from ****
-1	the movie sucked ,  it wasn't funny ,  it wasn't exciting .  they tried to make it so bad that it would be good ,  but failed .  and thinking it's cool to like this movie ,  next to the hype ,  are the only reasons that this movie is a success .  .  .   the fact that at this moment 50% voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me ,  either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes ,  and should be dealt with .  anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising .  it's success can only be described as a marketing marvel .
-1	i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot (  !  )  for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest ,  crappiest movie i've ever seen !   i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here  ( imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings )  .  .  .  the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions :   1 .  while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2 .  they've received hard cash for the votes 3 .  under gunpoint  i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .
-1	en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track  ( but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway )  ,  a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination .  the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area :  in the first story ,  an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband ,  but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie ;  and in the second story ,  a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on .   the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea ,  but with only two stories ,  it falls woefully short .  and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver :  the acting is lousy  ( with joe haggerty ,  as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson ,  giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen )  ;  the locations are uninspired ;  the script is dreary ;  there's a sex scene with zero nudity ;  and the ending .  .  .  .  well ,  that beggars belief .   to be fair ,  some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective  ( although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused )  and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic :  an ear is bitten off ,  eyeballs are plucked out ,  a face is removed ,  brains are squished ,  and there is a messy decapitation .  these positives just about make the film bearable ,  but be warned ,  the zombie chronicles ain't a stroll in the park ,  even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash .   i give the zombie chronicles 2/10 ,  but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d  ( although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference )  .
-1	unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14  ( except for the r rating )  ,  there are very few things to like here .  one or two lines from kenan thompson ,  david koechner  ( we really should see him more )  and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings ,  but sadly ,  that's it .  poor plot .  poor acting .  worse writing and delivery .  the special effects are dismal .  as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke ,  the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible .  if we consider the action portions ,  well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan .  this movie only contains the latter kind .  this leaves little left .  i'm so glad i did not pay for this .   despite any hype ,  i can read and think ,  so as i sat down to watch ,  i did not expect anything good .  i had no expectations ,  but was somewhat worried going in .  yet ,  like a train wreck ,  one cannot merely look away .  and even with no expectations ,  i was let down .  bad .  not even 'so bad ,  it's good' material .  i'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies ,  but this makes  " six string samurai "   ( which i liked )  oscar worthy .   no ,  this piece of over cgi'd rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth ,  little man and gigli .  how this is currently rated a 7 . 2 completely mystifies me .  brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers .   i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight ,  i witnessed a train wreck .  i need to go wash my eyes .  1 of 10
-1	i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started  " taking over "  the plane .   at first i thought maybe it should get a  " one "  for the comic relief .  but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more !    whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed .  and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are .  when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun .  the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay .  and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that .   this movie isn't worth a trip to blockbuster .  be warned :  if you pay for it ,  the only  " victim "  is your dumb ass .   if you want to be really scared ,  i suggest the descent .  if you want humor ,  go to your local stand up comedy club .  their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash .
-1	all internet buzz aside ,  this movie was god awful .  i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything .  instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie ,  and they completely missed .  there were only a few good parts ,  and a couple good lines by samuel jackson .  other than that ,  it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes .  all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie .  now that the movie has actually come out ,  hopefully this joke will die .  don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash .  if you're looking for something that's funny and entertaining ,  then just go to snakes on a blog .
-1	i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i ,  along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience ,  were vastly disappointed .  the movie wasn't even so bad it was good ;  it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim .  samual l .  jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame .  it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies ,  except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy .  it all seemed worn ,  flat ,  and overtly formulaic .  i'm shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun .  it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s*it and plays along with it ,  but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense .  it's the worst kind of lame movie :  it's joyless .
-1	the only thing great about the movie is its title .  in this case ,   " snake on a plane "  is example of not judging the book by its cover ,  the title says nothing about the movie .  when i went to the theater ,  i wasn't expecting citizen kane ,  i was expecting independence day ,  a movie that's pure popcorn fun ,  but instead ,  i got that horrible roy liotta movie called  "  turbulence "  yes ,  this is how bad soap is .  the only thing make soap better is its title .  and it's not even the apporiate title for the movie ,  the wasn't even a glimpse of  " snake "  or  " plane "  40 minutes into the movie !  what a false advertising !  if it wasn't for its title ,  soap would be just another unforgettable cheap b-grade summer movie .  and the r rating ?  it has to be the most undeserved r rated movie of all time !  the makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a r ,  all of the violence are kept pg-13 level .  you know what's really r rated ?  the r rated superstar edge !  see him at summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake !
-1	" raising victor vargas "  is one of those light ,  family movies that you can watch and do the n . y .  times crossword puzzle at the same time .  and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona ,  you don't have to  " pause "  the dvd .  just let it roll ,  'cause you won't be missing anything really important .  no twists ,  turns ,  or tension .  it's not really an ethnic movie ,  it's a movie about a poor ,  struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino .  they could have been any ethnic group .  it made very little difference .  i've seen it all a zillion times before .  just plug in a jewish family ,  an italian family ,  a black family ,  or an irish family .  just the accents and names were different .  if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians ,  the movie would have been a total snooze .    it's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight .  some said it was spanish harlem .  some the bronx ,  and another brooklyn .  as a life-long new yorker ,  i vote for the lower east side .  and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos .  they lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave .  some interaction with non-latinos might have created some excitement ,  interest ,  or tension .  remember west side story ?   and now for the oft-criticized cinematography .  i don't know if it was my tv or what ,  but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me .  the apt ,  the furniture ,  and the faces were all orange .  what was that supposed to mean ?  and the apt .  did look pretty cramped to me .  somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms .  well ,  maybe 50 years ago .  what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them .    and another annoying thing  .  .  .  . this is the second family movie i've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy  " jerking off "  .  is this private sex act necessary for us to watch ?  please spare me !  what's up with these directors ?    so  " victor vargas "  is a pleasant little movie .  it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents ,  which they did .  but the writers let them down ,  giving them a flat ,  unspectacular script to work with .  enjoy the show ,  but keep your fingers near the  " fast forward "  button .
-1	this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen ,  the graphics are ridiculous ,  and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process .   i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie ,  so i can't say i'm picky .  i have been struggling to find something to compare it to ,  but i just can't think of anything that matches this ,  maybe starship troopers 2 .  witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player ,  but compared to this its effects are great .  the acting superb and the script should be awarded .  you know when a movie is bad in a funny way ,  well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .
-1	b movie at best .  sound effects are pretty good .  lame concept ,  decent execution .  i suppose it's a rental .

-1	i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb .  but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score .   either way it was a real disappointment .  the movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest .  there really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes :  it felt like someone had been thinking :   " wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane ?  and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff ?  !  ?  "  and that's about it !  the plot is thin and unoriginal .  the snakes are bad cgi  ( but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone !  )  .  the acting is poor ,  and all people are unbelievable stereo types .   to sum it up :  it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen - stay away !
-1	oh dear lord ,  how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone ?  it reeks of cheese from start to finish ,  but it's not even good cheese .  it's the scummiest ,  moldiest ,  most tasteless cheese there is ,  and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually ,  truly enjoyed it .  yes ,  if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way ,  but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen .  i watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy ,  having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness .  we got the crapness  ( plenty of it )  ,  but not the chuckles .  it doesn't even qualify as a so-bad-it's-good movie .  it's just plain bad .  very ,  very bad .  here's why  ( look away if you're spoilerphobic )  :  the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death .  ok ,  i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was ,  but i think i grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene .  oh ,  and a guy witnesses it .  so ,  we already have our ultra-evil bad guy ,  and wussy but cute  ( apparently )  good guy .  cue hero .  big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion ,  saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ,  i . e .  hero is immune to bullets ,  everyone else falls over rather clumsily .  cue first plot hole .  how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was ,  or that he'd watched the murder .  perhaps this ,  and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions ,  was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema ,  but i doubt it .  in fact ,  i'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here ,  lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese  ( which we all know is good cheese )  .  so ,  the 'plot'  ( a very generous word to use )  .  good guy must get to la ,  evil guy would rather he didn't ,  hero sam stands between the two .  cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane .  as i said ,  no more poking at plot holes ,  i'll just leave it there .  passenger plane .  next ,  the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie ,  and what makes it everything it is - snakes .  yay !  oh ,  pause .  first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have .  hot ,  horny couple  ( see if you can guess how they die )  ,  dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear british guy  ( those pesky brits ,  eh ?  )  ,  cute kids ,  and jo brand .  for all you americans that's an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness .  now that we've met the cast ,  let's watch all of them die  ( except of course the cute kids )  .  don't expect anything original ,  it's just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious  ( really not )  parts of the body .  use your imagination ,  since the film-makers obviously didn't use theirs .   so ,  that's most of the film wrapped up ,  so now for the best bit ,  the ending .  as expected ,  everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face .  yep ,  ice-cool sammy included .  but wait ,  we're not all off the plane yet !  the last guy to get off is good guy ,  but just as he does he gets bitten by a  ( you guessed it )  snake  ( of all things )  .  clearly this one had been hiding in mr .  jackson's hair the whole time ,  since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier ,  despite the 200ft constrictor  ( the one that ate that pesky british bugger )  being unable to .  so ,  sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop .  at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed u-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort .  but no .  in a kind of icing on the cake way  ( but with stale cheese ,  remember )  ,  it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest .  how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago ,  let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me ,  but it did well in summing up the film .   actually ,  we're not quite done yet .  after everyone has sucked face  ( uncle sam with leading actress ,  good guy with tiffany ,  token black guy with token white girl ,  and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia )  ,  it's time for good guy and hero to get it on .  .  .  . in bali !  !  !  nope ,  it wasn't at all exciting ,  the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll .  yes ,  the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred ,  and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times .  that's it .  this is the first time i've ever posted a movie review ,  but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography .  if you like planes ,  snakes ,  samuel l . jackson ,  air hostesses ,  bad guys ,  surfing ,  dogs in bags or english people ,  then please ,  please don't see this movie .  it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again .  go see united 93 instead .  that was good .
-1	this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it's production .  the audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry ;  we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend .  how is it possible to be objective ?  this is our movie ,  isn't it ?  or is it ?  there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience's friend ,  giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them .  just look at that prime self-publicist eli roth ,  promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films ,  only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'hostel' .   david r .  ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film ,  but he was ,  quite understandably ,  quick to engage with it .  he took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level ,  getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy .  so many have enthused over this interactive ,  democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing .  nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans won't buy ,  and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated .  the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know .   isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach ?  individual creativity ,  talent ,  craft ,  ideas ,  all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses .  it's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings don't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different ?  because we happen to be film fans ?  well ,  thank god for us ,  because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake .   so ,  yes ,  i had fun at the movie - a midnight showing ,  fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film ,  and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere .  like christmas ,  everyone seemed determined that they would have fun ,  no matter what .  there was laughter ,  but i don't know if it was with the film ,  or at the film .  with a film as calculated as this one ,  is that even a meaningful distinction ?  there are some genuinely good aspects to the film .  samuel l .  jackson gives a well-judged performance ,  pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure .  rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles ,  and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate .   the stock characters are to be expected ,  but the total lack of suspense isn't .  what's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there's no creeping menace ?  there are several snake-jumps-out moments ,  but they're incredibly badly staged .  only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat .  the demise of the honeymoon couple ,  for instance ,  is shamefully botched .  most of the actors fail to make an impression ;  it's a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired  ( when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster ,  she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short )  .   there are worse movies ,  but there are many ,  many better ;  another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'lake placid' ,  and it's as apt a contrast as any i can think of .  that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent ,  the jokes were funny ,  the suspense sequences were scary ,  and it wasn't devised by committee .  that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus .  i don't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film .   this film will ,  in time ,  fade to become a mere footnote in film history .  if it sets a precedent ,  however ,  i'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time .  in all probability ,  nothing much will come of it .  perennial popcorn favourites - 'raiders of the lost ark' ,  'alien' ,  'halloween' and of course ,  'star wars' - just aren't produced by group-think .   in the mean time ,  i'll tell you what - i haven't half got a craving for some ingmar bergman .
-1	this movie was the worst movie i have seen since  " date movie .  "  i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared .  it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example ,  the eye ,  the tongue ,  the butt ,  the breast .  if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite .  for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person .  i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior .  i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie . so i don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .
-1	i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie  " rocked "  .  it is pure cg over-acted crap !  don't send an assassin ,  it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored ,  aggressive ,  venomous snakes on a plane !  the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to .  it is not  " so bad it's good "  it's so bad i'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again .  i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane !  a spoof !  was i wrong .  it's that whole  " it sucks ,  get it !  "  or samuel a .  jackson yells  " snakes on the plane !  thing .  well i'm sorry ,  i don't get it .  it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard .  if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung's cd ,  still live in their mommies basement ,  and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn ,  then rush to the theater and ask for one  ( since i doubt you have a girlfriend )  ticket for snakes on a stupid-butt plane .  to hell with movies like full metal jacket ,  pulp fiction ,  true romance ,  12 monkeys ,  clerks ,  etc .  there's no irony in watching good movies .  the true decline of the western civilization .  calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man ,  or even orgazmo .  i've said enough here .
-1	i saw the 10p . m .  showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special .  although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back  ( as i don't actually pay for movies anymore )  i didn't really find any redeeming qualities .   there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle ,  but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger  ( in mind more than age as this film is rated r )  male audience .  the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well .  i know you all want to hear samuel l .  say his infamous line ,  but let's be honest ,  it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off .  the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg ,  which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen .   now i am a reasonable man ,  i knew going into the theater that i wasn't going to be seeing  " casablanka ,  "  and i am at least thankful that this film is an original  ( albiet inane )  idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off .  however to be honest ,  if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .
-1	raising victor vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be :  being real .  unfortunately ,  there is no reality to this film .  the characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake .   the reason ?  bad directing .  peter sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal .  it seems mr .  sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel .  wrong !  it just gives it a badly-made feel .  similarly ,  shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film ,  it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on screen instead of enhance it .   of course ,  what's on screen is so painfully fake ,  as if mr .  sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look  " hip "  to his sundance buddies and show how  " edgy "  a filmmaker he is .   overall ,  the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director mr .  sollett is .  next time ,  how about taking a few writing and directing classes ?
-1	this movie deserves more than a 1 .  but i'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list .  seriously it's not that great its not that bad .  its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous .  these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say  " i'm rick james b ! tch "  no matter how old or annoying it gets .  i dread having to hear  " i'm tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane "  months from now from idiots trying to be funny .  its crappy plot crap acting etc .  its okay to love a bad movie ,  but you still gotta admit its a bad movie .   wait for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
-1	when discussing a movie titled 'snakes on a plane' ,  we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot .   what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes .  snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy ,  they crawl they slither .  these snakes do nothing of the sort .  they glide along like they would in a video game .  they are cartoon snakes .  i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary  why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures ?  why not rely on suspense .  .  the whole 'less is more' ethic .  or better still ,  why not just make them look good in the first place ?  and then maybe still use them sparingly  take one look at john carpenters 'the thing' .  here we have real slime ,  and gore of eerie proportions .  20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap 'snakes on a plane' .  when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee ?  special effects are going backwards !   sure you could say .  .  but the movie is a joke ,  get it ?  sure i'm with that idea ,  but do it well !  in addition to the above ,  this movie has crap dialogue .  and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way .   i could handle every other actor being part of this movie ,  except for jackson .  what was he doing there ?  the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago .  is this career progression ?  are you offering people value for money ?  no .  i'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie  the current generation seem to have very low expectations .  and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want .  on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including .  .  .  doa :  dead or alive ,   ( another )  cgi animal film called 'flushed away' ,  and another crap looking comedy named 'click' .  in addition to that i saw some awful trailers ,  including one for  ( another )  crap british horror/comedy .  i've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time  expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for £1 in 6 months time .  and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes ,  and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips .  forget it .
-1	$25 , 000 pyramid clues :  deep blue sea .  tremors .  slither .  eight legged freaks .   pyramid category :  movies that were funnier and more thrilling than snakes on a plane .   hell ,  with that definition i'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of ted and elaine in airplane !  as superior to snakes in both laughs and thrills .   the sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies :  anaconda !  besides the never to be seen again casting of jlo-cube-o . wilson-stoltz-wuhrer in the same flick ,  you had jon voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist .  his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a  " so-ludicrous-it's-fun "  movie .   in the end ,  snakes on a plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible .  every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year ,  all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater .  i heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for  " according to jim "  .
-1	i'd give this a negative rating if i could .  i went into this movie not expecting much ,  but i had an open mind .  the whole thing is stupid !  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson .  oh how original ;  if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that .  i have no idea how this movie became so popular .  seriously , the worst thing i've ever seen .  i wasn't entertained ,  it wasn't funny , i wasn't even bored !  i wasn't anything .  it wasn't even so bad it was good ,  it's just bad .  ridiculous actually .  please do not waste your money on this movie .  don't even rent this movie .  no clue how it's getting such a high rating .
-1	what can i say ?  i'm a secret fan of 'over the top' action and horror films .  especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo ,  but i'm not a fan of snake on a plane .   there are three potential draws to this film :   the comedy of the situation ;   the horror ;  and  the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane .    firstly ,  this film isn't written as a tongue-in-cheek horror or a comedy ,  and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself .  if you want to get the feel of the film ,  the trailer genuinely represents the movie ,  a horror .   secondly ,  if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks ,  you won't be disappointed .  it doesn't stand out above other movies ,  but it always keeps your attention .   thirdly ,  although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn't wear off ,  but you'll leave the cinema thinking  " what was all the fuss about "  .   i know this movie has a high rating ,  but it doesn't add up .  a )  many of the reviews where written before the film was released and ,  b )  the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10 ,  with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - why such an enormous gap ?
-1	i went into this film with expectations ,  from the hype ,  that it would be insightful and uplifting .  certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band  " wilco .  "   instead we get a lot of moping and whining about  " the process ,  "  a dishonorable and no doubt one-sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer/songwriter ,  a gut-wrenching confession by the fallen member's friend -- for like 18 years -- saying the  " friendship had run its course ,  "  and this whiny ,  uncompelling story about how one record label  " hurt their feelings "  by dumping them ,  only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels  ( oh ,  the tension .  .  . not !  )  they tried their best to make it look like it was a strain ,  but i suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist .  this doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline ,  insight or even a decent job at cinematography .  the strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch .   from the film ,  this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music ,  which they most definitely are not .  and i thought the music sucked ,  and i couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer .   i give it a 2/10 .
-1	disjointed ,  unclear ,  bad screenplay ,  poor photography and direction .  .  . all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at tbn .   tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  " china cry "  ,  the story of nora lam ,  to the big screen .  but  " the omega code "  is an unfortunate miscue .  as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  " china cry "  ,  i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone .  they do much good with their ministry ,  but this isn't an example of it .  don't waste your money .  .  . go rent  " china cry "  instead .
-1	the idea had potential ,  but the movie was poorly scripted ,  poorly acted ,  poorly shot and poorly edited .  there are lots of production flaws  .  .  .  for example ,  dr .  lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years .  wait for video ,  but don't expect much .
-1	interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code .  .  .  many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts .  .  .  the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video ,  to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s .  .  dont remember it ?  you wont remember this one either in a year or two .  this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls .  .  .  very shameful .  .  .  this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist's son ,  you too can play high-roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money .  .  .
-1	what was this about  ?  ?  pre-destination ,  you can not change the future cause it has already been written  ?  ?   i'll give it this much .  i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie .  this movie took a concept and made it watchable .   if you're looking for a recommendation ,  see it at matinee prices .  no thrills but an interesting concept .  they should have left the y2k reference out .  .  .  .
-1	.  .  .  .  this movie basks too much in its own innocence .  it doesn't tell a story ;  it's more a big time snooze fest .  while the actors are all personable ,  the story is so trite and goes nowhere .  i think victor rasuk has great charisma ,  but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .
-1	this film had so much promise .  i was very excited about this film .  in the end ,  it was laughable at best ,  painful at worst .  the acting styles ran the gamut from really ,  really ,  flat  ( the angels ,  the wife and daughter )  to over-animated  ( casper's character )  .  i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other .  pay special attention to the scene regarding  " the bug "  .  it's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out .  in defense of that scene ,  though ,  it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie .  i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations .  too bad they didn't make use of it .  i didn't feel like i was transported to exotic locations .  anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome .  however ,  to end on a positive note ,  i thought the sets were pretty good .  i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers .  it is my opinion ( and that's all it is )  that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased ,  this film would have been good .
-1	this movie is not based on the bible .  it completely leaves christ out of the movie .  they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ .  let alone talk about it .  it does not quote from scriptures .  the end times are called the great tribulation .  the movie does not even show bad times .  the seven bowls ,  seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure .  the anti-christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended .  the only part they got correct was there was two prophets .  the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures .  the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie .  i wanted to take unsaved people to it .  i feel that the movie is evil .  it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does .  i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books .   the second problem with the movie is it was just bad .  bad acting ,  bad special effects ,  bad plot and poor character development .  i have seen better episodes of miami vice .
-1	i truly wish i was not writing this review .  i'm a christian ,  so i waited anxiously to see this movie .  it seemed great -- a christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing  ( not that i buy the bible code itself -- you can make it say anything you want .  i do ,  however believe everything inside the bible )  .  so i'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews ,  when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes .  i had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while i was in the theater  ( i would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes ,  i'm sure )  .  once the final credits began to roll ,  however ,  i could reflect .  there were many parts of the movie i liked -- some mostly unexpected plot twists ,  some effects that were indeed special  ( i'm not counting the visions .  those were poorly done )  ,  and some interesting technical work -- fades ,  sets ,  that type of thing .  unfortunately ,  i got the distinct impression that if i read the book of revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour ,  i could've gotten a better script .  and the music was beyond cheesy  ( even for a bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue )  .  so i wish i could be like everyone else in the theater -- like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was -- but i'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a biblical shell and slaps a christian stamp on it .  i need a good plot and believable dialogue before i can enjoy most movies ,  and this just didn't have either .  i'm sorry ,  but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone .  and that's the tragedy .  when will we see some intelligent christian fiction ?  it has to be out there somewhere .  .  .
-1	the more i analyze this film ,  the worse it becomes .  first of all ,  why a motivational speaker ?  that part was just stupid .  i mean ,  why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker ?  is alexander stone really that disorganized ?  first he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world ,  so he looks to the bible for ideas .  many of these ideas ,  i might add ,  really have no reliability ( for example ,  the part of the  " the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror "  could have already happened .  it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something .  )  and gillen lane's family !  they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water !  i might add that since casper van dien/gillen lane is only in his twenties ( or that's the impression that i had ) and has a ten year child ,  he had his child during high school .  yeah ,  there goes tbn's family values .  also ,  why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like ?  i'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said .  the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated .  this film doesn't do that .  the beginnig starts off well ,  with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's omega code .  then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of ,  the two prophets tell him  " tell your master that we are here !  "  .  dominic ( ironsides )  replies  " he already knows "  and points to a small surveillance camera .  that part sent chills up my spine .  had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film .  i'll give michael york credit :  he does a fine job of acting out his character ,  as does michael ironsides .  but the good guys are horrible .  i've already went on about lane's family   .  now that i'm over the acting ,  i'll get on to plot .  this is obviously a baptist film ,  since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf .  the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle ,  as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done .  also another diatribe against the vatican ,  their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded ,  since gillen explains to the pope that it's not the end of the world ,  but the beginning of a new one also ,  the vatican  ( or israelis ) says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world .  whoever it was ,  they wouldn't just secede ,  they'd send over commandoes and kill them .  this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying  " we're not going to talk to you any more !  "  .  come on !  i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor .  mediocre in short .
-1	if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become ,  this one would take the prize .  the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world .  just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be ?     the acting was bad at best .  casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film .  michael york's work was a fair match for the role ,  since he was the center of the film ,  and did a good job .     this plot was sickening and very disturbing .  no tender or immature minds should see this film .  this is how a basic good vs .  evil plot can go astray .    there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles ,  who look for ways to market this type of junk .  there must have been something censored out to get a pg-13 rating ,  but it was still awful .
-1	i didn't know what to expect from the film .  well ,  now i know .  this was a truly awful film .  the screenplay ,  directing and acting were equally bad .  the story was silly and stupid .  the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film ,  but he didn't .  i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad .  where was the focus to the film ?  where was anything in this film ?  christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it .  it was shabbily done and a waste of my money .  do not see this film .
-1	yes i admit i cried during this movie .  it was so incredibly disappointing ,  that i couldn't help myself but cry .  tbn  ( trinity broadcasting network )  has done it again .  first with having the million dollar man  ( ex-professional wrestler )  on their program ,  and now this .   the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies .  it was quite amusing ,  yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate .  the movie follows what is known as  " the bible code "  rather than following actual biblical scripture .  this film is extremely poorly made ;  from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting .  its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie .  it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie .   i highly recommend you do not watch this movie ,  even if your life depended on it .
-1	what else is left to say ?   i've read all the reviews here and most are right on .   .  however ,  one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it  ( or something along those lines )  .  evil ?  !  wow ,  what a shocker .   .  i mean ,  tbn basically made this film .  open your eyes please .   anway ,  this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years .   the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it .  if this movie can be made ,  there are no limits ,  and therefore ,  we have no choice but to get ready for  " yentl 2 "  ,  and  " ernest loses the omega codes .  "   for those of you who are into the biblical stories ,  the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started .
-1	quite honestly ,  the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time .  during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat ,  trying to decide if i should demand a refund .  but since i hadn't paid to see it in the first place  ( passes )  ,  i figured i might as well stay .  and i didn't think it could possibly get any worse .   it did .  i will quickly run through the low points  ( includes some spoilers )  :  the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane ,  a motivational speaker with two phds .  the characterization was inconsistent ;  for example ,  lane ,  despite his credentials ,  is a complete nitwit .  then there's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies ;  we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code .  also ,  terrible  " action "  sequences :  lane escapes from tough situations without explanation ,  and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger ,  it turns out to be a dream sequence !  that's cute for grammar school writing assignments ,  but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture .  the pacing was bad :  after a long opener ,  the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds .  later ,  the pacing improves ,  but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around .  and as someone else mentioned ,  years pass yet no one  ( not even lane's young daughter )  ages .  that was disconcerting .   there are a few good things ,  though .  the quality of the film  ( e . g .  lack of graininess )  is high and very attractive .  the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism .  also ,  there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god  ( finally )  to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me ,  someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior .  but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie .  unfortunately ,  it was followed by major incomprehensibility .   the characters ,  dialogue ,  direction and acting were all poorly done .  michael ironside had nothing to do ,  and michael york was just weird .  i think the producers wanted to do too much ;  if the plot had been tighter and more focused ,  and the characterization more fleshed out ,  the film would have been far better .    in a nutshell ,  the omega code disappoints .  definitely do not pay to see this .  i give it ** out of ten stars .
-1	i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character .  words cannot describe ,  nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was .  but please allow me to try to describe it :  horrible acting ,  terrible dialog ,  corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network .  its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep ,  religious message attached to it .  they failed miserably .  it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time .
-1	someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as  " realistic "  by some people .   i didn't see anything realistic about the characters  ( although the actors did their best with really bad parts )  or the situations .  instead ,  i saw a forced ,  self-conscious effort at being  " edgy "  ,   " gritty "  and  " down and dirty "  .   sadly ,  it takes a lot more than hand-holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way .   it's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies ,  with bad cinematography ,  non-existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as  " art "  .   it's little wonder that films like  " in the bedroom "  or  " about schmidt "  get such raves .  i found them to be meandering and very average ,  but compared to the current slew of independent clones like  " raising victor vargas "  they are outright brilliant and inspired .   a few years ago seeing an  " independent "  film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care ,  and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets ,  nowadays ,  it means that chances are you'll get yet another by-the-numbers ,  let's-shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors .  and of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived .   is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies ?  not at all when you see films like raising victor vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them .
-1	i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about 15 people .  we all expected a good piece of christian film-making .  what we got was an excruciatingly painful ,  drawn-out ,  and pretty boring attempt at a film .  it has good looking production values but also has poor acting ,  a weak script with lousy dialogue ,  and no real sense of direction .  from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night .  we all hated it ,  and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than  " anaconda .  "  none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours .  flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad ,  bad movie .  i'd give it a 3 out of 10 ,  and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable  " movie "  werewolf  ( 1996 )  the night before i saw this movie .
-1	the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency .  there was a bit  ( but precious little )  of good acting ,  primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg ,  who only appeared once and had no lines .  otherwise the acting was decidedly bad .  the plot line was rather weak ,  and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation .  certainly not one of the year's best .
-1	i am a youth pastor's wife and we took some youth to see this film .  we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them .  they didn't get it and i didn't enjoy it .  it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world  ( the bible code ,  the torah code and the code in the koran )  and is so questionable as to be laughable .  this is not a step forward for christians in the arts ,  it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door .
-1	i'm a christian .  i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians ,  however .  as a rule ,  they are  " know-nothings "  when it comes to movie production .  i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen .  however ,  they did a hideous job of it .  the acting was horrible ,  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion ,  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across .  not only was the movie terribly made ,  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong .  however ,  in this  " critique "  ,  those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into .  in short ,  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen ,  and i would not recommend it to anyone ,  except for comic relief from the every day grind .
-1	i would highly recommend seeing this movie .  after viewing it ,  you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying  " at least it wasn't the omega code .  "   forget my money ,  i want my time back !
-1	i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry .  the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society  ( men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do )  the movie falls .  becoming boring and not funny at all .  they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable .  i didn't like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either .  i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed .   i don't recommend this movie .
-1	i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons .  for the first half hour it's actually pretty decent .  although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video ,  its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad .  in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao  ( another recent dominican film )  which turned out to be much much better than i expected .  the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole ,  which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic .  unfortunately i don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter ,  and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them .  about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits .  not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge ,  space age ,  cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's ,  but the whole plot just goes down the drain .  the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations ,  and clever one liners .  to top it all off  ( and i guess i should warn you now **spoiler alert** )  it all turns out to be a dream .  oh my who didn't see that coming ?  oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie .  well after about an hour into it i start thinking  " hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be ?  ?  "  and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95 .   when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art ?  !  ?  !  perhaps a comedy to match france's amelie ,  or an action flick to match thailand's ong-bak ,  an animation as akira was to japan ,  a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england ,  or a socio-awakening journey as waking life had here in the states .    .  .  . i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of dr ,  search los jodedores and you'll know what i'm talking about .
-1	it has a great name ,  but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money ,  in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone .   and yet the producers  ( roberto angel salcedo )  calls him an actor ,  but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting !  !  .  .  .  . period .  the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing .   for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it ,  but they didn't !  !  and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad ,  i don't buy it .   but hopefully this is as bad as it gets .  to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it ,  that might work out .   maka
-1	the film is poorly casted ,  except for some familiar old hollywood names .  other performances by unknown names  ( i . e .  ,  jennifer gabrielle )  are uninspiring .  i have seen other films by this director ,  unfortunately this is one of his worst .  perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay ?    in a positive note ,  kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion .  i enjoyed pat more in karate kid ,  though .  there are many good movies to see ,  and in short ,  this one is not one of them .  save your money and the celluloid .    jason vanness
-1	one of the worst films i have ever seen .  how to define  " worst ?  "  i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again .  somehow ,  one-hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans ,  mary kay saleswomen ,  las vegas ,  gays ,  fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy ,  sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed .  how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be  " the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one "  is beyond me .  the worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script :  in 1958 ,  elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted !  worst special effect ?  that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis' grave ,  potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world ,  resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere .  potentially ,  this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans .  however ,  the rampant stupidity  ( nixon gave elvis a dea badge ,  not fbi credentials .  .  . and i could go on and on )  actually undercuts that conventional wisdom .  ugh .  i used the word  " wisdom "  to describe this stupid movie .  this is truly a horrible ,  horrible film .
-1	i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight .  it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer .  the plot had potential  ( who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets ?  )  but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing .  towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return ,  then a group of stars moves together to form an  " elvis "  constellation ,  which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators ,  sending them crashing through the roof .  bad .  .  . really bad .  which is the theme for the whole movie .  i'd avoid this one at all costs .
-1	being an elvis fan ,  i can't understand how this proyect could be done .  is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time ,  totally unfunny ,  silly and plenty of mistakes about the king .  come on ,  elvis' grave in a public park ?  a mention about suspicious minds in 1958 ?  .  .  . and these are just two examples .  some people in the cast tries to do their best ,  mike starr is funny  ( specially as an impersonator )  ,  the tom hanks cameo is a surprise ,  but the guy playing the young elvis sucks . overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute .  if you want to see an ultra cheap ,  insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis ,  i truly recommend you  " bubba ho-tep "  instead of this mess .
-1	raising victor vargas :  a review  you know ,  raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big ,  steaming bowl of oatmeal .  it's warm and gooey ,  but you're not sure if it feels right .  try as i might ,  no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right .  victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director's part .  apparently ,  the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side ,  and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof .  he was right ,  but it didn't fool me .  raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen-year old boy called ,  you guessed it ,  victor vargas  ( victor rasuk )  who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've toured .  the movie starts off in `ugly fat' donna's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her ,  but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best-friend harold  ( kevin rivera )  comes-a-looking for him .  caught in the attempt by harold and his sister ,  victor vargas runs off for damage control .  yet even with the embarrassing implication that he's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood ,  nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat .  on a hot ,  new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy  ( judy marte )  ,  who's not just pretty ,  but a strong and independent too .  the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film .  the story also focuses on victor's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita  ( altagracia guzman )  ,  his brother nino  ( also played by real life brother to victor ,  silvestre rasuk )  and his sister vicky  ( krystal rodriguez )  .  the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family .  victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp-daddy ,  his feelings for judy and his grandmother's conservative catholic upbringing .   the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few ,  but glaring errors .  throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky ,  nino ,  grandma ,  judy and even judy's best friend melonie .  the problem is ,  we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood .  we know that he knows how to lick his lips ,  and comb his fro ,  and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack ,  but that's all .  we know that nino plays piano ,  and quiet well ,  you could see it by the awards on the family piano .  we know his sister nicki ,  is a gossip-loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv .  we know that grandma is a hard-working traditional latina woman who's trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption .  yet where is the titular character ,  victor vargas ?  he's in this movie somewhere ,  but we only know what the movie tells us .  this is by far the film's biggest flaw .  victor vargas isn't so much a character but a ping-pong ball ,  bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother ,  but we never get to know who victor vargas really is .  this is important because as i've mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he's a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan .  he's a total alpha-male .  victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all .  why should anyone ?  so by the end of the movie ,  in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways ?  how could such a two-dimensional character have any depth ?  if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand-held shot .   raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner-city neighborhood to the big screen .  something that few films have done before in the past .  the film has been complimented for feeling so real ,  and i won't  argue with that .  i haven't seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor .  seriously ,  although the movie has some nice shots of the city ,  the writer/director peter sollett was way too dependent on close-ups and hand-held shots .  this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep-breathing exercises to keep from passing out .  as the film continues ,  the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen ;  you can practically smell victor vargas's cheap cologne .  the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast .  the indoor scenes of inner-city apartments make them look small and cramp ,  which is not true .  i've been in those type apartments ;  i used to live in one .  they're not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they're decent living spaces .  by the movie's standards you'd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brick-and-mortar ,  chipped paint and cracked walls .  unfortunately ,  sollett's constant use of close-ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom-in on one scene come off as totally amateurish .  but raising victor vargas is only sollett's second film ,  and his most well known ,  a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films .  one review i read summarized the movie as ,  `ethnicity for ethnicity's sake , ' and i cannot agree more .  if victor vargas were truly a great film and story ,  then the characters' applicability wouldn't matter whether they were latino ,  chinese ,  etc .  yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle-class suburbia with a bunch of teeny-bopper white kids the results wouldn't be such glowing reviews ,  and we'd see the film's flaws more clearly .  indeed ,  some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me .  while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question .  for example ,  victor ,  nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep .  this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe .  any self-respecting latino family wouldn't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen-year old girl .  at first i was unsure ,  perhaps i was wrong ,  but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified .  considering how conservative the grandmother is ,  you'd think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room .   as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household ,  raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full-time ,  i could relate to the movie in many ways ,  which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie .  unfortunately ,  my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film .  maybe it's because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen .  maybe it's because without any further introspection by the film ,  victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot-blooded latino ,  who'll just end up shouting to girls from his car ,  `hey bay-bee ,  ju want to get into my luv mah-cheen ? ' either way i don't like him ,  so ultimately how can i like a film about him ?  so if you'll excuse me ,  i'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits .
-1	darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman ,  with odd ties to elvis presley ,  running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada .  .  . and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own .  kim basinger ,  a still-attractive actress of considerable merit ,  likes to pick quirky movies to play in ,  but this dreadful screenplay  ( by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber )  hasn't an iota of good humor .  the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy ,  but even on a shambling ,  shameful level ,  the picture is crude and sloppy .  if you do watch ,  see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac ,  hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face .  hopefully both she and elvis were well paid .  no stars from ****
-1	my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie ?  impressive cast  even for the supporting characters ,  none of which helps this movie really .  i have to admit though ,  tom hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom ?  did you lose a bet ?  the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though - by far a classic !  the premise is good .  basinger's character ,  struggling with existence as a pink lady ,  is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales .  this happens as corbett's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by . what else . extortion .  as they both make their way ,  they have numerous run-ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas .  soon ,  the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer .  unfortunately ,  premise doesn't mean the movie was good .   when watching this movie ,  imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important .  it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense .  the movie tries hard ,  but ultimately falls way way way short .  ultimately ,  it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny .   it isn't the worst ,  but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don't say i didn't warn you !
-1	omg !  the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis-in-the-box .  apart from that ,  how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie ?  ?  maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time .  .  .  there are no laughs to mention ,  the stereotypes are pathetic ,  the cast is wasted ,  the direction is amateurish .  now that i think about it ,  most of the blame probably lies with the director ,  joel zwick .  he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved .  don't waste your time like i did ;  but then ,  i enjoy a good train wreck .  geez ,  now the system is telling me i need more lines-- here ya go :  this movie should be called return to sender .  okay ,  now that was funnier than anything in the movie .  .  .
-1	elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker .  scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing .  filled with unfunny deaths ,  trite gay characteratures ,  and hack jokes ,  this film is more desperate than amusing .  this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement .  let us remember her the way she was  ( talented )  and not what she's become .  david leisure ,  the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here .  zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn .  the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king . the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen .  she really looks like her and is actually pretty good .  the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo .  the cameo isn't all that funny ,  but at least its not painful .  one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie .
-1	i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child  .  when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count   judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one  .  having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere  .  there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories  ?  perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative   this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source  .  it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters  .  i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy  ?
-1	i notice that the previous reviewer  ( who appears to be still at school )  gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel .  the major problem i had with this  ( 1999 )  version was the casting of anthony way as tom long .  anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini-series  " the choir "  .  i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in  " the choir "  .  unfortunately the small boy who appeared in  " the choir "  had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time  " tom's midnight garden "  was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom .  it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom  ( as played by anthony )  would befriend the far younger hatty .  in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable .  for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects .  the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic .  as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20 . 00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5 . 00 ,  need i say more ?
-1	if you like bad movies ,  this is the one to see .  it's incredibly low-budget special effects  ( you'll see what i mean )  and use of non-actors was what gave this film it's charm .  if you're bored with a group of friends ,  i highly recommend renting this b movie gem .  it's mulletrific !
-1	i would love to have that two hours of my life back .  it seemed to be several clips from steve's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script .  don't go ,  if you must see it ,  wait for the video  .  .  .
-1	a difficult film to categorize .  i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were .  nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows ,  not acted out .   this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show ,  with a largely insignificant sub plot going on ,  which just seemed to get in the way .  however as any irwin show is always worth a watch ,  this film is well worth a look too ,  but not on christmas day .  talking of which ,  i've better things to do too than be on here .   a high 4/10
-1	this movie has a very broadway feel - the backdrop ,  the acting ,  the 'noise'- and yet that's all it has .  some 'sense' of a broadway without the bang .    the movie is slow-paced ,  the picture disjointed ,  the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical .    disappointing :  sinatra   intolerable :  sinatra's fiancé---surely ,  the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary .    tolerable :  mr  " i remember the numbers on my dice "    delight :  brando's understated singing  ( very biased !  )   surprise :  how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes .  it's the bone structure !  how i would've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again .
-1	on steve irwin's show ,  he's hillarious .  he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'oh ,  this is one nasty bloke ! ' and looking straight into the camera .  he put his face in the camera too much !  and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead ?  and terri had the worst acting i'd ever seen !  like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says 'steve' .  she didn't sound scared or anything ,  it was just 'steve' .  i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing .  i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid .
-1	i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy !  i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc .   but ,  everything in this movie is bad .  farting jokes ,  people getting eaten ,  and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time .   it's a really bad film that you have to stay away from .  all the  " jokes "  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid .  the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old .   i'm surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .
-1	gday mates !  just watched croc hunter the movie .  it was alright but the show seems more real .  this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters .  a few things :  steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles .  yeeeowch !  for reals you know that hurts .  and cant they jump up high ?  hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff .  there was two major cleavage shots in this movie .  when terry find that baby joey she goes like  " we have to nurture them ,  just like a baby "  .  woah !  i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid .  that woulda made it pg-13 though .  while on terry ,  did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry's knowledge on ritual mating .  she knows her sex stuffs .  movie takes place in queensland ,  austrailia .  i want a koala ,  dingo ,  and joey !   steve's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie .  albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie .   oh and if anyone else watches this ,  try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc .  he was eating her sheep !  !  i would be mad too !
-1	so ,  steve irwin .  you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs ,  snakes ,  lizards ,  tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles ,  and mud ,  not only daily ,  but with enthusiasm .  he was never able to make me want to do it ,  but he managed to make his wife come close .   this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled ,  have a migraine ,  or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity  ( currently well populated by disney films )  .  it's too noisy .  well ,  steve is too noisy .  he's just so happy all the time ,  and would cut right through the blasé' teenager  ( i can hear it now :   " that movie was so stupid "  )  or the tylenol with codeine .  i'd say his enthusiasm is catching ,  but if it was ,  i would own a room full of snakes ,  and that hasn't happened yet .  i agreed they're beauties ,  but i'm still not going to pet them .   plot was indeed predictable .  bad guys were so bad ,  for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore .  but the movie was filled with animals ,  and steve and terri ,  which is why i watched it .  that plot  ( if you could call it that )  was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck .  my expectations were low and stayed that way .   i was hoping ,  though ,  that there would be a bit of a sequel ,  where steve and terri  ( having worked on their acting skills )  have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur .  i still can't believe we won't see steve anymore .  i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel ,  at least .  i can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is .  crikey !
-1	i caught this at a test screening .  all i can say is :  what .  .  . the .  .  . hell ?  this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for  " scarface .  "  it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense ;  and even if you do leave your brain in the car ,  the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny .   the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to  " save "  a crocodile which contains a cia probe .  the cia comes after irwin to get their probe back ,  irwin mistakes them for poachers ,  and sets out to  " stop "  them .   that's about all the story there is ;  the rest is over-the-top lampooning of australian culture  (  " didja see dat ?  "  and  " crikey !  "  )  and strangely choreographed action sequences .  at one point ,  irwin mounts a speeding rv and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it .  yes ,  that's right :  steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an rv .  let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film .
-1	ok ,  first of all ,  steve irwin ,  rest in peace .  you were loved by many fans .  now .  .  . this movie wasn't a movie at all .  it was  " the crocodile hunter "  tv program with bad acting ,  bad scripts ,  and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals .  he was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist .  millions will miss him .  but the whole movie idea was a big mistake .  the plot was so broken ,  it was almost non-existent .  casting was horrible .  the acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors .  the direction must be faulted as well .  if you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors ,  no matter how bad the script is ,  you must not be that good in the first place .  i could have written a better script .  i wish i had never been to see this movie .  of course ,  i watched it for $3  ( $1 . 50 for me ,  $1 . 50 for my son .  )  while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action .  my son ,  who is not so discriminating ,  liked the movie alright ,  but he still has never asked to see it again .  if you want fond memories of steve irwin ,  buy his series on dvd .  avoid this movie like the plague .  if i were steve ,  i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie .  respect him :  avoid this movie !
-1	i never was an avid viewer of  " crocodile hunter "  ,  but did occasionally see an episode ,  or a bit of an episode ,  and when the news spread about steve irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006 ,  it certainly caught my attention .  this movie ,  with steve and his wife ,  terri ,  playing themselves ,  but in a fictional story ,  was released in 2002 ,  but i didn't hear of it until several years later ,  and even after that ,  it took me a while to get around to seeing it .  well ,  now i have seen it ,  and after looking here first  ( more than once )  ,  and seeing its rating ,  i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be ,  though it could have been a bit better .  apparently ,  it's supposed to be a comedy ,  so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all .   a u . s .  satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia ,  where it is swallowed by a crocodile !  while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt ,  and are unaware of what's inside it ,  two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon !  the agents are assisted by jo buckley ,  and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them !  on steve and terri's mission ,  they face other types of dangerous wildlife ,  not just the crocodile ,  and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it ,  when steve sees the cia agents after them ,  he mistakes them for poachers !    not only did i not laugh once while watching this film ,  the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents .  apart from that ,  i don't think i found anything even mildly amusing .  it's also a bit of an incoherent mess ,  switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters ,  and it seems like clips from  " crocodile hunter "  and clips from an action thriller  ( or something like that )  put together for some reason .  also added to that mix are the ranch scenes ,  which also seem to be from somewhere else ,  and as funny as brozzie drewitt ,  played by magda szubanski ,  is supposed to be ,  she's not .  at one point ,  we see her farting ,  so we have a fart joke ,  a major cliché in modern comedy !  are they so hard to resist ?  !  i also found the typical  " crocodile hunter "  scenes ,  with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers ,  to be tedious ,  but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didn't help .   steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist ,  and is sadly missed by them ,  while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him .  no matter which side you're on ,   " the crocodile hunter :  collision course "  is not a well crafted movie .  i'm sure it does help if you're a big steve irwin fan ,  but even if you are ,  there's no guarantee that you would like this movie ,  as some fans clearly haven't been impressed .  in fact ,  it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have ,  so maybe it won't help .  like i said ,  there's no guarantee .  i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show ,  this movie was unnecessary .  the attempt to combine what is usually seen in  " crocodile hunter "  with a fictional story unfortunately failed ,  and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes !
-1	some people say steve irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act .  watch this film :  it's obvious he can't act .   steve irwin ,  dangerman star of the small screen in his *crocodile hunter diaries* ,  *croc files* and eponymous *crocodile hunter* series  ( you see a naming trend here ,  or is it just me ?  )  ,  rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *crocodile hunter :  collision course*  ( yup  there's a definite trend of words beginning with 'c' )  - basically an episode of *crocodile hunter* mashed together with a b-movie .   on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer  ( magda szubanski )  ,  steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies  ( lachy hulme and kenneth ransom )  ,  out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed .  will it hurt my credibility to say  " they're on a collision course with wackiness "  ?   ( what credibility ?  - ed note .  )   the plot is irrelevant ,  as it is steve's animal magnetism that propels the film .  if you find his persona trying ,  the film is a failure ,  but if you're a fan of either him  ( as a businessman ,  conservationist or just plain ass-klown )  or his television shows ,  expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget .   john stainton ,  faithful liege ,  best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter *oeuvre*  ( can it be called that with a straight face ?  )  ,  writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester .   the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve  ( one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks )  and terri  ( steve's spouse of 10 years ,  fiercest ally and closest friend )  treat it like it is one of their documentaries ,  breaking the  " fourth wall "  and speaking directly to the camera ,  whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie  ( well )  .  it wouldn't be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve's life ,  we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics ,  or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting ,  crisp audio and seven action angles .    while terri is unfairly painted as steve's mildly incompetent sidekick  ( her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last ,  i'm not complaining )  ,  steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him ,  doing all his stunts himself because ,  well ,  to him they're not really stunts ,  just a day at the office .    of course ,  watching this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings .  but to those of us who never met him ,  this kind of malarkey  ( as well as various incarnations of the *crocodile hunter* series in constant re-runs )  keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows .  the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him .  and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints   so enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend .  he died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that .

-1	the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters .  the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times .   it may sound weak and cliché but it's true ;  you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and terri irwin .  it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is .  i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure .  for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and terri irwin just aren't good actors ,  not even when they play themselves !  their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long ,  distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times .   the movie had quite some potential ,  i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch ,  so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was ;  brilliant !  the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters .  the movie does has a certain entertainment value ,  at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still ,  i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie .   watching this movie felt like a waste of time .  still this movie might be watchable just once ,  when it gets on tv ,  on a rainy afternoon .  it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential .   4/10
-1	i saw this film yesterday .  .  i rented the dvd from blockbuster .  .  in fact ,  i know one of the actresses from the film .  .  i won't say who .  .  !   ( that's kept under wraps .  .  )  but i must admit ,  it wasn't as good as i thought it would be .  .  tom savini ?  hats down to this guy .  .  but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long .  .  what lacks the film is the idea ,  the script ,  sound ,  etc .  .  it may look like a good movie .  .  but it wasn't that entertaining .  .   well ,  i'm glad my sister paid £10 for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster .  .  i chose this one .  .  and i was disappointed .  anyway ,  thumbs down for me .  .  !  not my cup of tea !  0 out of 10 !
-1	i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it .  it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing .  the shots used are disgusting ,  they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time .  my head hurts try to watch that load of  " you know what "  .  dirt on the  " mystery machine "  window make you see light from the lighting on the windows .  .  . annoying .  what else .  .  .  it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there .  i only directed short films ,  but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film .  .  .  .  the story is unbelievable ,  just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful .  so pretty much ,  try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost ,  it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental ,  and that 1h30 hour of your life you'll never get back .  .  .
-1	nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc ,  but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location .  he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can't make a prim missionary ,  sarah brown ,  go out to dinner with him .  sky takes up the challenge ,  but both men have some surprises in store   this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour ,  with big sets ,  loud music ,  larger-than-life roles and performances to match ;  broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing ,  which i don't .  my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music .  i like all kinds of music ,  from albinoni to zz top ,  but broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea .  this was written by the tag team of frank loesser ,  mankiewicz ,  jo swerling and abe burrows  ( based on a couple of damon runyon stories )  ,  and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak .  blaine's two numbers for example are identical ,  unnecessary ,  don't advance the plot and grate on the ears  ( and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you )  .  there are only two memorable tunes ,  luck be a lady  ( sung by brando ,  not sinatra as you might expect )  and sit down ,  you're rockin' the boat  ( nicely performed by kaye )  but you have to sit through two hours to get to them .  the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful ,  laid-back performance ;  he also sings quite well and even dances a little ,  and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons .  the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise ,  bustle and vowel-murdering of noo yawk .  fans of musicals may dig this ,  but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show .
-1	if you liked  " blair with "  you'll like this one .  it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack ,  and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments .   it also has tom savini ,  so if you like romero's  " dawn of the dead "  or tarantino and rodriguez'  " from dusk till dawn "  you're in for a treat .  he is an icon and a very good actor as well .   no ,  seriously .  this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time ,  and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well .  i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect ,  but this was just a pure waste of time .   the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 ,  was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth .  .  .  no ,  i'm just kidding .  i must have missed before i hit  " submit "  on the vote form .   stay away ,  even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover !
-1	when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow .   1 ) the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local .  dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens .  what ,  who ,  how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst .  2 ) the van will break down .  3 ) whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about . 4 ) they will find a house inhabited by a madman ,  he will capture them .  5 )  the house will have a phone but it will not work ,  it will be disturbingly decorated ,  there will be flickering neon light ,  spiders and maggots .  6 ) the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start  ( here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor )  .  7 ) the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap ,  weak scare and will then be killed properly .  8 ) only a girl will be left alive from the group .  9 ) there will be an unnecessary twist at the end .    add to these elements naked sirens  ( who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately )  that seduce and kill the teens ,  throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie .   i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film ,  darkhunters ,  which is one of the worst films i have ever seen .  at times the cinematography is very good ,  the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies .  i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity .  however ,  the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film ,  it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again ,  but amongst the dvd extras .   if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief .  there is more to say about this than the film itself .  one staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea .  he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if  " people will get it "  .    i'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough ,  acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work .  if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question ;   " what was the point ?  "  this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies ,  any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked .   the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats .  they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use .  however ,  the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary .  there is a simple distinction to be made here ;  mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style ,  roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures  .  i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant .   the best moment is reserved for robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film .  those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that .  i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule .  the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers ,  complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born .  as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting ,  they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant .   the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast .  robert's swears blind in voice over ,  'i didn't want to make a film that was like baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground .  there is also a simpering ,  self-indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is  " the best british film in years "  .  i don't know who he is trying to convince .  at one point in the commentary track robert's says jokingly  " i can see people sitting at home saying  " this isn't amazing ,  its sh$t "  he isn't wrong .
-1	ok me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves .  anyway ,  the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff .  .  .  and tom savini !  there is just no way this movie can fail !  right ?  wrong !  !  it just seems like such a waste !  there was really no story ,  the dialog was terrible  ( is anyone there ?  x 1000 !  !  !  )  ,  the characters were .  .  well ,  they really lacked any kind of personality .  .  .  the effects were terrible .  .  and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing .  .  with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff ?  we were sitting the whole movie waiting for something .  .  .  anything to happen .  .  .  but no .  .  .   " oh ,  here comes the nymphs !  great !  oh .  .  they're kissing .  .  .  again .  .  .  and now for the violence !  ok .  .  .  nothing really happens .  .  .  again .  .  .  oh ,  now they run around .  .  .  and the closeups of eyes .  .  .  again .  .  .  oh ,  heres tom savini !  oh .  .  .  he died .  .  .  right .  .  .  ok ,  maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen .  .  no .  .  oh !  cool !  a severed head !  the end .  .  .  oh crap .  .  "  and finally ,  since i'm so full of myself .  .  i'll tell you this !  give me a van ,  six actors ,  a weird looking house ,  tom savini ,  a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen .  .  .  i've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects ,  better acting and a better script than this .  .  .  what is this johannes guy doing ?  ?  making cool movies is easy ! it could have been so great .  .  .  i'm really upset !  !
-1	i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with  " book of shadows "  ,  i was wrong .  this film makes that look like  " the magnficiant ambersons "  compared to this piece of shameless ,  unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie .  i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it ,  bobbins .   and were these people english ?  and where is the forest> i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands .  the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation .  those angels looked like anorexic pornstars  ( turned most of them were ,  did my research )  .  i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces .   p . s i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
-1	booted out of heaven ,  a gang of horny naked female angels  ( with big plastic fangs )  have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by .  it's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes an independent low budget horror made in the uk ,  forest of the damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting ,  effects and direction i have seen in a long time .   director johannes roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled 'shock' moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish .  throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons tom savini and shaun hutson ,  and you have one real bad movie on your hands .   some fun may be derived from the film's sheer shoddiness ,  and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour ,  but most will find this a chore to sit through .
-1	oh god where to begin .  .  .  .  .  . bad acting .  .  .  . characters you just don't care about .  .  .  are they american or british .  .  .  they seem to think they are in america ,  because where else is this enormous forest in the midlands .  .  .   one big fault .  .  .  they are driving all night through these woods .  .  .  unless they are going around and around they'd have been in scotland come the morning .  .  when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over .  .  .  .   and they're mobiles don't work .  .  so what do they do .  .  .  split up of course ,  make it easier to be picked off .  .  .  so three go looking for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to 'care' for the unconscious woman .  .  .  so what do they do ,  rather than make her comfortable ,  cushion her head ,  cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away .  .  .  . and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in .  .  .   and onto the horny angels that are supposed to have desired human kind so much that they were ejected from heaven to live amongst us .  .  . so what do they do ?  embark on sexual relations with any men they encounter ?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off .  .  .  i think they are missing the point .  .  .   these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are cannabalistic vampires .  .  .  and as for tom savini saying how breath takingly beautiful they are .  .  .  . well those gals have good bodies but nothing special in the face dept .  the lead role was far more pretty than these so called irresistible sirens .  .  .   rubbish film waste of £2 . 30 from my local library .  .  .
-1	note to horror fans :  the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting .   i watched this because :   the premise sounded slightly promising :  it's not .  it's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either .    the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful :  it's not .  it's so not .  the amateur cinematography makes sure the  " fallen angels "  are about as sexy as the average homeless person .   the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre :  he's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting .  come to think of it ,  savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie .  it's not that he's bad ,  but he's almost always in bad movies .  his only good role was in from dusk till dawn ,  and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since .   but let's focus on the positive :  forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie .    everything else is a negative .  obviously the writer is allergic to originality .  the script is terrible .  that's all a given after the first 10 minutes .  but the clueless pacing ;  the way the director treats  " plot "  and  " characterization "  as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway ;  and the excruciatingly long and boring driving ,  walking ,  and nature sequences  ( no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution )  show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general .   this is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad :  if it's written and directed by the same person ,  expect garbage .
-1	i rented this flick for one reason tom savini ,  i respect his work but this was a real let down ,  i had horrible clichés ,  half of the film was naked women so called  " fallen angels "  running around trying to act scary ,  oh and then there was the occasional  " blair witch "  black and white motion sicken camera scenes .  tom's character was really awful ,  horrible script .  and you got to love these lines they use .   " is anyone there ,  who is out there ,  this isn't funny "  no but your acting was .  i wish i could give this flick a 0 !  oh the names of the characters .  judd ,  molly ,  ally ,  emilio ,  but they did leave out anthony ,  the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting .
-1	this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time .  i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies ,  but this movie was a disappointment .  the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures .  when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them .  he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents ,  and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either .  .  .  not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience .  it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the  " cross incident "  .
-1	the plot was very thin ,  although the idea of naked ,  sexy ,  man eating sirens is a good one .   the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie/splatter/lesbian mouth licking shots in between .   the characters were wooden and one dimensional .   the ending made no sense .   considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it ,  you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects .  some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them .   brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush ,  naturally ,  and of course the lesbian moments .  i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the 'shower scene'  the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely .   if i had been watching this alone and aged 15 ,  i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes  ( with 1 hand of the remote control )  ,  then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza .  .  .
-1	though frank loesser's songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer ,  they're bollixed by joseph l .  mankiewicz' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation--when it's over it barely feels like you've watched a musical .  mankiewicz doesn't seem to know how to present loesser's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect :  for example ,  one of the best numbers ,  the showstopping `adelaide's lament' ,  concludes by having adelaide  ( vivian blaine )  belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge ;  and stubby kaye's faux-spiritual `sit down ,  you're rockin' the boat' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there .  mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue  ( adapted from abe burrows' stage book )  has none of the wit that his films like `all about eve' have .  part of the blame has to go to the leads ,  just about all of whom are miscast :  marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he's in a musical ,  frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential  ( the songs are not tailored to his style )  and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might .  only blaine ,  as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide ,  commands our attention like a broadway pro should .  the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets .
-1	well this is a typical  " straight to the toilet "  slasher film .   long story short ,  a bunch of teenagers/young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons .   this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage :   -naked women ,  -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky ,  -gory death scenes ,  -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff ,  but never bra less ,  -a creepy ,  crazy man who knows about the evil ,  -lesbian kiss scene ,  -sex being a killer ,  -no plot  even then for a cheesy slasher film ,  it was really terrible .  the atmosphere is totally dead .  nothing ,  not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity ,  was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested .  watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold .   give the demonic  .  .  .  .  .  0/10 .
-1	forest of the damned starts out as five young friends ,  brother & sister emilio  ( richard cambridge )  & ally  ( sophie holland )  along with judd  ( daniel maclagan )  ,  molly  ( nicole petty )  & andrew  ( david hood )  ,  set off on a week long holiday 'in the middle of nowhere' ,  their words not mine .  anyway ,  before they know it they're deep in a forest & emilio clumsily runs over a woman  ( frances da costa )  ,  along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they're travelling in won't start & they can't get any signals on their mobile phones .  they need to find help quickly so molly & judd wander off in the hope of finding a house ,  as time goes by & darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the woods .  .  .   this english production was written & directed by johannes roberts & having looked over several other comments & reviews both here on the imdb & across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other's not ,  personally it didn't do much for at all .  the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with 'additional screenplay material' whatever that means ,  the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre  ( 1974 )  with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction .  then there's stephen ,  played by the ever fantastic tom savini ,  who is never given any sort of justification for what he does .  is he there to get victims for the angels ?  if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in ?  the story is very loose ,  it never felt like a proper film .  the character's are poor ,  the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that's going on .  having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scenes here .   director johannes doesn't do anything special ,  it's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at .  there's a few decent horror scenes & the tom savini character is great whenever he's on screen  ( although why didn't he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly ?  )  & it's a shame when he gets killed off .  there are a couple of decent gore scenes here ,  someone has their head bashed in ,  there's a decapitation ,  someone gets shotgun blasted ,  someone throat is bitten out ,  someones lips are bitten off & someone is ripped in half .  there is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity ,  not that it helps much .   technically forest of the damned is ok ,  it's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching .  this was shot in england & wales & it's quite odd to see an english setting for a very american themed backwards horror .  the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this .  horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end & proves he should stick to writing rather than acting .   forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film ,  it seems to have fans out there so maybe i'm missing something but it's not a film i have much fondness for .  apart from one or two decent moments there's not much here to recommend .
-1	from the start this film was awful !  why was it that bad ?  ?  if it isn't the naked women ,  not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening !  !  then it's the 'crazy' old guy at the gas station ,  who isn't so much crazy ,  but more  " i'm not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods "  !  !  then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis .  .  .  .  apparently ,  without touching you .  .  . and this is according to the opening scene .  .  .  .  they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck ,  which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up .  then you have sophie holland who plays ally ,  i have never seen such baaaaaad acting ,  she is more of a  " me me me ,  if i'm not having fun no-one else is ,  and i don't wanna do this so i won't ,  and i'm the meanest cow on the planet ,  i'm sarcastic ,  petty and if i don't get things my way i will sulk !  "  ,  kind of person .  .  .  .  reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl's attitude .  i don't think it's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch ,  or how low-budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the 'locked' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side !  !  this film is completely laughable !  if it were a spoof then it would have been successful .  .  . only just though ,  but ,  as a horror film is was just plain wrong !  !  !  i can't even being to describe everything that went t ! ts up in this movie i would run out of room !  although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision !  !  it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor ,  which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow !  so is it any wonder they don't get away with it ?  ?  and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened !  no pain ,  no weakening from blood loss ,  nothing !  ?  but the silliest part is when all of a sudden  ( and i mean that literally )  it's one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs ,  and then lo and behold ,  shaun hutson picks her up .  .  . of course not without a line to promote his books !  !   ( altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors )  but suddenly ,  and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why .  .  .  she's evil herself and lures hutson to his death ,  then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can ,  even after his 'dazzling' performance on why no-one should ever venture there for whatever reason .  .  . cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere .  .  .  . and here endeth the film .  .  .  . finally !  my conclusion .  .  .  . if you hadn't already guessed by now .  .  .  . absolute rubbish !  there was no proper thought went into it at all ,  whoever was aiming the camera needed firing .  .  . and come to think of it so did 99% of the cast !  if the right director ,  actors ,  and budget got behind this it could have been decent .  but ,  once again ,  low-budget english horror films but the rest of the genre ,  the country ,  and the english film-making industry to shame !  !   ( and i'm english so i'm allowed to say that )  !  in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15-20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area .  all i kept thinking throughout this was  " jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this ,  its absolute cow's testicles !  !  "  but i can't turn a film off after i've started watching it unfortunately .  i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well !  if there was an option for 0/10 then believe me i woulda chose that ,  cuz this film isn't even worth the one point i did give it !    but this is just my opinion ,  watch it and decide for yourself .
-1	oh boy ,  where do i go with this one ?  herendous acting ,  weak plot ,  stupid deaths ,  pointless nudity .  .  .   this isn't entertainment .  .  . this is hell .   hell .   don't waste your money ,  time ,  or life on this pit of evil .   it's just .  .  . god damn is this movie awful !  tom savini ,  why ?  !  why would you waste your life on this crap ?  this movie not worth it .  i'd rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch this .  .  . this sinful act again !   please take my advice and stay the f#@k away from this elephant turd of a film .  no ,  you know what ?  i shouldn't even have to call this thing a film !  just stay away !
-1	i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie  " 1 "  but this movie was beyond terrible .   the acting was terrible ,  the plot was ridiculous ,  the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying .  usually when i watch scary movies i think it's dumb when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out  " hello is anyone there ?  "  - but at least they're believable when they do it .  .  this movie couldn't even get that right .   this is a movie that'll make other b-horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces .   i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again .  it's awful !
-1	angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens .  talk about high concept .  on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini ,  but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen-time ,  his five minute presence seems a tad long .  the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie ,  but though they might have the body of an angel ,  their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day .  mediocre acting and amateurish gore-effects don't help and the night scenes fatally recall paris hilton's most famous movie .  so bad that it is really bad .
-1	this movie is a terrible waste of time .  although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 .  i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose .  this is also a  " horror "  film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight .  my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared .   the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries .  it cannot be that high in demand .    the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie ,  half of the time she is british and half the time she is american .
-1	*****this review may have spoilers - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story*****  the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale .  the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale .   the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale .  this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing .   this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather ,  is never transformed into a swan .   all the production value that money can buy ,  cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting .   the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done ,  there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery .   the writing made me very nervous ,  too .  the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory .  why would any girl want to marry a boorish ,  self-absorbed prince who disliked women ?    turner's turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one-liners more than acting nuance .   even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy .   perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt :  so cheaply '90's ,   what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography ,  matte work and production design .  it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes ,  sets and settings as the story unfolded .   for some cinderella storytelling ,  go for two gems :   1 )  rodgers and hammerstein's cinderella musical with lesley ann warren .  even with the obvious stagey tv - 60's look to the sets ,  this is the best version on celluloid - bar none .  an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment .  engaging ,  diverting and memorable writing and music .  this is the classic .   2 )  ever after- this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective ,  alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale .  the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well .
-1	this film actually works from a fairly original idea - i've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway .  however ,  the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest ;  we follow a bunch of kids that ,  for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest .  the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks/nutcases/zombies etc ;  but really ,  the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme .  many films of this ilk don't have a single good idea - and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one .  the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for ,  rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from .  this is good up until a point ;  but it soon gets boring ,  and the almost complete lack of any back-story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the 'horror trash' category .   it's been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location ,  and in spite of films like the blair witch project ;  it still makes for an excellent horror setting .  this is one of the film's major assets ,  as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve .  the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination ,  and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesn't help ,  as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away .  the cast is made up of kids mainly ,  but there is a role here for tom savini ;  who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department .  the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves .  the naked ladies tend to look great ,  and if it wasn't for them ,  this film would get very boring very quickly .  there's nothing to recommend this film for really ;  but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks ,  you might find some enjoyment here .
-1	for the first forty minutes ,  empire really shapes itself up :  it appears to be a strong ,  confident ,  and relatively unknown gangster flick .  at the time i didn't know why ,  i thought it was good- but now i do .    one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful .  i don't mind films with psychos and things ,  to prove a point- take jackie brown ,  for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this ,  but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment .  you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach .  another major problem is the protagonist .  he is smug ,  arrogant ,  yet- ironically enough- not that bad .  he doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer .  the fact is ,  at the end of the day ,  this film is completely pretentious .  not slick ,  not clever ,  just dull ,  and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs .    * out of *****  ( 1 out of 5 )
-1	i actually intended to see this movie in the theatre .  it was actually sold out .  i actually went to see solaris instead ,  which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002 .   victor rosa  ( john leguizamo )  ,  a tough ,  streetwise 'street pharmacist' ,  freaks out when he sees a kid get shot ,  so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with jack  ( peter sarsgaard )  .  things seem to be going pretty well until jack skips town with his girlfriend trish  ( denise richards )  .  this happened very late in the movie ,  so had they not revealed this in the preview ,  it might have been an interesting twist .  but they did ,  so it's not .   in fact ,  there's not a single interesting thing about this movie ;  everything is given away in the preview .  if you saw even one preview ,  you saw the whole movie ,  so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps .  go to the website ,  download the preview ,  save yourself $3 . 99 .  there is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film ,  other than how terrible the soundtrack is .   i hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired .  twice .  most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were ricky martin and gloria estefan duets ,  and  ( i may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this )  they both had less talent and musical ability .   the acting is at best poor ,  the script is at best a crime against humanity ,  and denise richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag .  you know things are bad when john leguizamo  ( he was in the pest !  )  upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities .
-1	the plot was predictable ,  and fighting with guns gets old ,  but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don't really care about real movies .  i would endulge in true art movies ,  like 'clerks' ,  'something about mary' ,  'el mariachi' ,  or 'la taqueria' .
-1	tedious girls-at-reform-school flick ,  which plays somewhat like a prison movie .  chris  ( linda blair )  is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father .  once in the de facto jail ,  she is gang raped by her fellow female  " inmates "  .   overlong  ( even at 98 minutes )  ,  with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless .   15 year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed ,  but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene .   *1/2 out of ****
-1	i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop's .  and this one surely is an oop .  one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out ,  she never became a mega star .  that's one of the reason's many of her films are oop .  she gives a good performance in this movie .  it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends .  played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 ,  that's funny .  the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity .  in most editions it's cut out ,  why ,  i don't know ,  no blood is involved ,  okay ,  blair is butt naked but nothing is shown ,  no t&a so nothing to offend people .  but the movie is slow ,  extremely slow .  it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep .  it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows ,  no gore no nothing .  why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me .  if you're a fan of blair ,  buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is .
-1	i picked this one up because the music was done by hans zimmer ,  a customer of metasonix modular synths  ( made by someone dear to me )  .  the jacket art says  " the 2003 version "  .   i give it one point for a strong female ,  one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster's light blue eyes ,  of which there are plenty of shots of .   it was fun seeing david maccullum casually swimming  ( the pool has a plexiglass viewing window !  )  ,  while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in greece .    the sets were marginally impressive-that is ,  rich people's houses in l . a .  and mendanassos  ( sp ?  )  ,  where the castle was .  i found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around .  the wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me .  i kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty .  .  . etc .  and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding .  i stumbled over things like why did she light a fire ,  blow out the match ,  then throw the match into the fire ?  !  dumb stuff like that .  it was clunky at best .  oh well .  robert morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .
-1	1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10  ( dir-walter lang )  :  disappointing musical from a character development standpoint ,  in my opinion ,  from this much-heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece .  there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal ,  at times ,  of the king of siam by yul brynner -- but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings .  i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character's and their situations .  i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing ,  but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me .  the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things .  we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil .  there is a side forbidden romance between the king's newest wife ,  played by rita moreno ( a latino as an arab--come on !  !  )  and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though .  deborah kerr ,  as the main female character annie -- is ok but not that convincing either .  the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does .  this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .
-1	there's tons of good-looking women in this flick .  but alas ,  this movie is nudity-free .  grrrrrrrrrr strike one .   ahem .  one story in this film takes place in 1971 .  then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage ?  hello ?  continuity ,  anyone ?   as you might know ,  this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d .  and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen .  i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this ,  but there was no 3d ,  just double-vision blurs .  i didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3d movies ,  hunting season and camp blood .  sure ,  the 3d in those ones sucked too ,  but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect .   this thing is a big ball of nothing .   and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame ,  yum !  i'd like to see more of her .  in movies ,  as well .  looks like janet margolin at a young age .  purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
-1	disappointing musical version of margaret landon's  " anna and the king of siam "  ,  itself filmed in 1946 with irene dunne and rex harrison ,  has deborah kerr cast as a widowed schoolteacher and mother who travels from england to siam in 1862 to accept job as tutor to the king's many children--and perhaps teach the royal one a thing or two in the process !  stagy picture begins well ,  but quickly loses energy and focus .  yul brynner ,  reprising his stage triumph as the king ,  is a commanding presence ,  but is used--per the concocted story--as a buffoon .  kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better ,  despite having to lip-synch to marni nixon's vocals .  perhaps having already played this part to death ,  brynner looks like he had nothing leftover for the screen translation except bombast .  second-half ,  with anna and the moppets staging a musical version of  " uncle tom's cabin "  is quite ridiculous ,  and the rodgers and hammerstein songs are mostly lumbering .  brynner won a best actor oscar ,  but it is feisty kerr who keeps this bauble above water .  overlong ,  heavy ,  and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term .  ** from ****
-1	this is a kind of genre thing ,  meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't .  if you do ,  you'll love this .  personally ,  i prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers ,  and eleanor powell ,  bill robinson ,  ruby keeler ,  james cagney ,  shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s ,  the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off .   this film is a case-in-point .  the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me .  by then ,  the story didn't have much appeal ,  either .  the presence of deborah kerr is another minus .  i don't think i've seen a movie she starred in that i liked ,  including this one ,  where the goody two-shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam .   ( i which she had !  )  .    however ,  divorcing myself from likes-and-dislikes ,  there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks ,  particularly those who liked  " the sound of music "  a decade later .  there are similarities in the r&h musicals .  thus ,  if you liked the julie andrews flick ,  you should like this ,  too .    this is a lavish production with ,  yes ,  a capital  " l .  "  this is the kind of big-production musicals you rarely saw after that generation .  you also get the dubbed singers ,  unlike today ,  where the actress isn't able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr ,  as she did with natalie wood in  " west side story "  and audrey hepburn in  " my fair lady .  "    yul brynner is  " king mongkut "  and is the stereotypical traditionalist ,  the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way .  he isn't  " progressive ,  "  as the left wingers like the say ,  but the education teacher  ( kerr ,  as  " anna leonowens "  )  will set him straight .  secular-progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer !  however ,  yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more-bark-than-bite character .  justifiably ,  he is the big star of this film .  brynner had magnetism .  even in  " the magnificent seven ,  "  yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience .   in summary ,  it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it .  i'll leave it at that .
-1	madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic ,  non-offensive ,   " family-friendly "  fare and ,  more importantly ,  if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing .  if ,  like me ,  you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like musson ,  muncey ,  cantrell ,  slovak ,  etc .  ,  prepare to be disappointed .   professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book .  i needn't repeat what they've said .  what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the  " glory years "   ( which many would argue were already past in 1971 )  .   yes ,  it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast ,  though it was clear that the restored versions  ( hats off to the volunteers at the hydroplane and race boat museum )  were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed .  but where was the sound ?  much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind-numbing roar of six allison or rolls-merlin aircraft engines ,  wound up to rpm's never imagined by their designers ,  hitting the starting line right in front of you .  you didn't hear it ,  you felt it .  real hydro buffs know exactly what i'm talking about .  there's none of that in madison .  instead ,  every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a  " heroic "  musical score .   and then there are the close-up shots of the drivers ,  riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines ,  in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero .  or ,  in one particularly ridiculous shot ,  taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a  " rocky "  salute from a bridge pier .  in reality ,  some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mph .   as one reviewer so aptly put it ,   " the sport deserves better than this .  "   finally ,  since another user brought up anachronisms ,  i'll add one :  the establishing shot of seattle shows the kingdome and safeco field .  neither existed in 1971
-1	this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with .  but first the movie ,  it's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with william holden .  what they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras ?  why move the movie up to 1966 ?  so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests ?  why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement ?   as for the casting ,  some hits some misses .  jay o .  sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin .  brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes .  he's believable as an ex-bmoc jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of william holden .  i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him  ( pardon the pun )  .  gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played .  she didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required .  maybe it's because she and brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be .  but then again holden was ten years too old .  bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from  " the taming of the shrew "  .   as for mr .  inge's play ,  i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue .   " the twilight zone "  i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode ,   " spur of the moment "  where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland ,  because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter .
-1	perhaps it's because i am so in love with the william holden - kim novak version ,  or because i'm not a gen-x'er ,  but this was absolutely the worst remake i have ever seen .  without the original's soundtrack ,  it just seemed like another typical tv movie .  .  . yes ,  about as bland as kraft cheese .
-1	bizarre take on the cinderella tale .  terribly poor script ,  but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance .   visually stunning in some parts ,  but that's about it .  the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s .  fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel .   if you're really in the mood for a cinderella story - i suggest  " ever after :  a cinderella story "  or  " the glass slipper "  .
-1	according to reviewers ,  the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school .  jolly joke !   1955 ?  the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet ,  but there it is on the bandstand .  the ford pony car was not invented yet ,  but there it is playing oldies music .  the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's .  the pony car at best is from the mid 1960's .   20 year-old college kids ?  josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-tv movie was produced .   the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv's .
-1	william cooke and paul talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines .  feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth .  .  . and a scroungy town tramp named ralph ( gunnar hansen .  .  . of leatherface fame ) wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire .   one tale is the old retread of  " the hook "  ,  two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand .  another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed .  they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t .  as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off .  one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas ,  who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus .  the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies .   without a big budget for special effects ,  campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse .  a bit corny ,  but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale .  the acting is understandably not award worthy .  cast members include :  tres holton ,  courtney ballard ,  h .  ray york ,  johnny tamblyn ,  walter kaufmann ,  kevin draine ,  david avin and paul kaufmann .
-1	well ,  what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation ?   there are some amazing actors in this  ( oliver reed ,  sarah miles ,  christopher plummer )  but they clearly are clocking up the money .   lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics - anthony with hugh grant  ( who looks suitably embarrassed )  and gilbert with helena bonham carter .   if you really want to see a  " watchable "  adaptation of cartland ,  the bonham carter one is the one to go for  (  " a hazard of hearts "  - what a title !  !  )  .  gilbert is the weak link in that ,  but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act ,  and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek  ( edward fox & diana rigg )
-1	the first power  ( 1990 )  was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's/ early 90's era of cheaply made horror films .  i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts .  this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain't even funny .  the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison .  lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role  ( he plays a hard-boiled cop )  and tracey griffith  ( melanie's more attractive sister )  plays a psychic .  don't waste your time with this one because it's bad .  what a minute ,  i take it back .  this movie makes a great party film .  check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun ,  she has the nicest legs i've ever seen on a nun that wasn't in a jesus franco nunsploitation flick .  yeow !   this marked an end of an era for l . d . p .  his star was tarnished and he couldn't draw flies to a dung heap .  it was d . t . v .  for him until his  " ressurection "  a few years later .   not recommended unless you're desperate .
-1	people tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer  ( whose name escapes me at the moment )  .  whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair ,  he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree .  it's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on ,  by the way .  other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise ,  like  " house 3 "  ,   " shocker "  and  " ghost in the machine "  .  anyway ,   " the first power "   ( a . k . a  " pentagram "  )  isn't a completely terrible effort ,  but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills .  the film starts off as an okay ,  albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero lou diamond philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims .  he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium ,  played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith .  she leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him ,  as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe !  thanks to tess' helpful hints ,  detective logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty ,  but patrick channing made a pact with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing .   " the first power "  gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit .  instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world  ( that's what i would do in his position )  ,  channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper .  he annoyingly calls him  " buddy-boy "  all the time and possesses the bodies of logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him .  even though never really boring or poorly realized ,  it's a very weak film to endure ,  mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà-vu .  writer/director robert resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché  ( the killer got sexually abused as a child )  and even the players' lines can easily be predicted .  as soon as griffith explains she's able to predict the future ,  you just know that ,  somewhere at some point in the film ,  she's going to say the ridiculously overused line  " i tell people who to live their lives ,  but my own life is a mess "  .  yawn .  lou diamond philips' performance is adequate enough ,  but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of  " la bamba "  and  " stand and deliver "  serious as a tough copper .  there also are decent supportive roles for mykelti williamson  (  " forrest gump "  )  ,  carmen argenziano  (  " when a stranger calls "  )  and b-movie horror legend david gale  (  " re-animator "  )  appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film .
-1	patrick channing  ( jeff kober )  is a disciple of satan / serial killer who possesses the  " first power "  :  even after being captured by detective russell logan  ( lou diamond phillips )  and executed in the gas chamber ,  he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will .  with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton  ( tracy griffith ,  melanie g . 's half-sister )  he attempts to stop channing .   this concept probably had some possibilities ,  i think ,  but ultimately  " the first power "  suffers from routine scripting and film-making .  this is nothing we haven't seen before ,  sometimes done better .  there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers .  more to the point ,  it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary .  phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails ,  cynical cop stereotype ,  and griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard ;  best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober ,  doing his best to be supremely creepy .   the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak .   not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind ,  therefore :   4/10
-1	i jotted down a few notes here on the first power ,  lou lambada diamond phillips' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest  .  .  .   1 )  lou diamond phillips was recently indicted for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison .  i only hope that he can find armani prison wear to go off in style with :  one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $4500 designer overcoats ,  a $7300 designer silk suit ,  and seeing his $3500/month los angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by mies van der roeh .   2 )  leading lady tracey phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin ,  flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed ,  and amazing breasts that are hi-lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan .  at least back in the 1970's our demonic killers undressed their victims before doing away with them ,  though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination .  by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like .   3 )  professional psychics living in los angeles can afford $4 million dollar condos on mullholland drive overlooking los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was roughing it .  as a matter of fact the condominium used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch's mullholland dr .  ,  which at least had the good sense to make it's condo resident a successful movie director .  the only professional psychics i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud .   4 )  i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful ,  and his  " how's it going' ,  buddy boy ?  "  line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since  " thanks for the ride ,  lady !  !  "  from creepshow 2 .   5 )  underneath major metropolitan cities there are huge vats of simmering acid that will explode into huge fireballs if someone throws a lit zippo lighter into them ,  which is why major public waterworks plants all have no smoking signs plastered all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous .  and since zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing ,  the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $7300 gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous .   6 )  the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least ,  and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released .   7 )  movie satanists always amaze me :  here is a guy who has tapped into some luciferian bid for power ,  and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him ,  he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments .  speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible ,  can fly ,  and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies -- and yet he obliges star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion ,  yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold schwartzeneggar or apollo creed to ensure that he wins .   and on and on  .  .  .  to be watched in the company of wise-cracking friends while consuming beer .  you'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously .   4/10
-1	detective russell logan ( lou diamond phillips ) has a major problem on his hands .  the serial killer ,  patrick channing ( jeff kober )  ,  for whom psychic extraordinaire tess ( tracy griffith ) helped him capture ,  has been resurrected with the first power (  .  . given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber ) and can possess the bodies of the weak .  somehow ,  russell ,  who joins forces with tess (  .  . who has an understanding of what they are up against )  ,  will have to stop channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands .  they will seek help from sister marguerite ( elizabeth arlen ) who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power ,  but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop channing .  . a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of channing ridding the world of his evil .  she'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell ,  who'll need all the help he can get when channing kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual/ceremony .   in the film ,  mykelti williamson ,  always a reliable welcome supporting actor ,  gets the partner of russell role .  . so you know what will happen to him .  as in films of this type ,  everyone around russell is dying ,  but when he attempts to kill channing ,  he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses .   pure occult rubbish .  . stupid from the gate to the finish line .  phillips and griffith try ,  i'll give them that ,  but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance .  kober ,  who is normally often always effective as the heavy ,  is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips .
-1	the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it affords jeff kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he's done so well in the last 25 years .  kober is a worthy successor to lyle bettger who specialized in those parts back in the fifties .   but it's not enough ,  the first power is a souped up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an lapd detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers .  kober is his latest catch ,  but kober's in league with a lower power and they're going to team up and make lou's life miserable for him .  even after kober is given the gas chamber ,  his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises .   mykelti williamson is on hand as lou's partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth arlen as a nun with insights are around to help lou .  will he succeed in battling forces from beyond ?   by the time the film ends ,  you no longer care .  lou really got trapped in a turkey .  maybe the devil made him do this film .
-1	rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to  " ordinary people " --concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap .  despite downbeat subject matter  ( given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain )  ,  there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring .  unfortunately ,  the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience .  what with robert duvall ,  glenn close ,  and wilford brimley in the cast ,  the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of  " the natural "  .  too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping ,  memorable picture .  *1/2 from ****
-1	when childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie ;  it's touch and go whether you should revisit it .  anyway ,  i remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by jeff kober .    " the first power "  is not a very good movie ,  sad to say .  it's chock full of those cop clichés and a very poor script with holes a truck could drive through  ( along with countless convenient  " twists "  that help the story run along )  .  lou diamond phillips is the over-confident bad ass cop who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber only to find out he was a minion of satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power of possessing every weak minded person who he comes across .  through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case .   ahhh ,  this is trash .  but enjoyable as such ,  especially if you have fond memories of it .  it scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good .  as for any kind of logic here ;  forget it ,  just about every scenario is thrown in for good measure and you end up with a cross between a steven segal action flick and a 70's demonic flick .  and who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast lou diamond phillips in the lead here ?  needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and i've never had the problem with the guy so many reviewers here seem to have .  as for tracy griffith as the psychic ,  the less said the better .  but kober is pretty good as the killer ;  always liked that actor .    " the first power "  may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a  " brain switch-off "  is needed .  beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and i'll definitely have loads of it the next time i give this movie a spin .  all in all ;  not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids .   " see you around ,  buddy boy "  !
-1	an annoying experience .  improvised dialogue ,  handheld cameras for no effect ,  directionless plot ,  contrived romance ,  ick !  to the whole mess .  ron silver was the only real actor .  gretta sacchi was terrible !  henry jaglom did better with eating which suited his style much more .
-1	i recently viewed this atrocity in my film program ,  and i thought it was awful ,  as i said in my tagline ,  it was pretentious ,  trite ,  petty and phenomenally self-important .   i consider myself a fan of film ,  and all the things that film has to offer .  if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival ,  i will watch a&e .  .  .  . and they would probably be alot more objective about it .   i dont recommend it ,  period .
-1	i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from ,  what happens to them or where they are going .  i realize that hollywood's greatest pastime is navel-gazing ,  but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with .  for what it's worth ,  though ,  the discussion that followed the showing ,  under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series ,  did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics .  i disagree .
-1	awful !  awful !  awful !  no ,  i didn't like it .  it was obvious what the intent of the film was :  to track the wheeling and dealing of the  " movers and shakers "  who produce a film .  in some cases ,  these are people who represent themselves as other than what they are .  i didn't need a film to tell me how shallow some of the people in the film industry are .  i suppose i'm at fault really because i expected something like  " roman holiday "  .   i'm not a movie-maker nor do i take film classes but it appeared to me that the film consisted of a series of 'two-shots'  ( in the main )  where the actors (  !  )  had been supplied with a loose plot-line and they were to improvise the dialogue .  henry jaglon makes the claim that he along with victoria foyt actually wrote the screenplay but the impression was that the actors ,  cognisant of the general direction of the film ,  extemporised the dialogue - and it was not always successful .  such a case in point was when ron silver made some remark which really didn't flow along the line of the conversation  ( and i'm not going back to look for it !  )  and greta scacchi broke into laughter even though they were supposed to be having a serious conversation ,  because silver's remark was such a non sequitur .  you get the impression too that one actor deliberately tries to 'wrong foot' the other actor and break his/her concentration .  another instance of this is when a producer tells silver to  " bring the &*%#@#^ documents "   ( 3 times )  .  silver looked literally lost for words .  i have seen one other film which looked like a series of drama workshops on improvisation and that was awful too !   the fact that jaglon was able to attract greta scacchi  ( no stranger to australia )  ,  ron silver ,  anouk ami ,  and maximilian schell suggests it was a 'slow news week' for them .  peter bogdanovich had a 'what-the-hell-am-i-doing-here' look on his face at all times and i expected to hear him say :   " look ,  i'm a director and screenwriter - not an actor "  - which would have been unnecessary to state !  faye dunaway seemed more interested in promoting her son ,  liam .  apart from the jerky delivery of the dialogue ,  the hand-held camera became irritating even if it was for verisimilitude - as i suspect the  " natural "  dialogue was - and the interest in the principals became subsumed to the interest in the various youths walking along the strand trying to insinuate themselves into shot .  that at least approached cinema verite .  so that ,  along with the irritating french singing during which i used the mute button ,  made for a generally disappointing 90-odd minutes .   i think we should avoid apotheosising films such as this .  trying to see value in the film where it has little credit in order to substantiate a perceived transcendental level to it is misguided .  there was really nothing avant-garde about it .  it didn't come across as a work of art and yet it wasn't a documentary either .  i know ,  it was a mocumentary but the real test is whether it is entertaining .  i was bored out of my skull !  it did have one redeeming feature :  it pronounced 'cannes' correctly so i gave it 3/10 .
-1	movie industry is tricky business - because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life ,  too .  that's the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an 'insightful' film about film .  and indeed ,  no better proof of the industry's trickiness than seeing anouk aimée and maximilian schell trapped in this inanity .  the insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like  " should i make a studio movie that pays a lot or should i make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self ?  "   " do the latter ,  please .  "  or :   " our relationship is not only professional ,  it's private as well .  it's a rather complex situation to handle ,  isn't it ?  "   " yes ,  it is ,  my dear .  "  between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees ,  hotel lobbies and american movie posters  ( no sign of non-american film presence on the croisette )  .  recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable ,  making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages .  jenny gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence in the frame .
-1	after being a big fan of the ten minute t . v episodes of 'stella street' ,  i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation .  unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed .   i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t . v episodes ,  and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing ,  as if the actors had said them once ,  and couldn't be bothered to say them again .  i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again .   *spoilers* the plot of the film starts with stella street  ( a normal english street in surrey )  ,  gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years' ,  including michael caine ,  al pacino ,  jack nicholson and the rolling stones .  all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster ,  and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people .  there are some nice moments ,  but on the whole ,  the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring .  *end of spoilers*  in the t . v episodes ,  all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell  ( including females )  ,  but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast .  i think this was a mistake .  her impersonations weren't funny ,  and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do .   if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street ,  you may find this film entertaining .  but if you were a fan ,  i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated .  4/10
-1	apparently ,  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood .  i use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director andy copp's commentary  ( which i didn't have available to me )  or reading up on the film prior to watching ,  viewers won't have a clue what it is about .   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage ,  but unless they're also fond of pretentious ,  headache-inducing ,  experimental art-house cinema ,  they'll find this one a real chore to sit through .   82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound ,  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue ,  this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity :  if you've still got all your marbles ,  you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  ( i watched the whole thing ,  but am well aware that i'm completely barking !  )  .
-1	this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow .  the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again !  things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear .  was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production ?   poor film making aside ,  the story is vile just sick evil sh*t if you like rape ,  murder and self harm this is right up your alley .  and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed .  i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out .  never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty .
-1	*spoiler warning*  first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 .   the idea is good ,  but there are too many stupid errors in the movie ,  failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been .  first of all she never fights alone .  after an initial very strange doubt from her mother  ( which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie )  the rape victim is not alone .    she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew's strange traps .    her friends are unbelievably nasty .   the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon .  ethan is very much the leader of the crew  ( hey ,  they even say so )  and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk ,  but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong .  everyone just simply hates him .  .  .  why ?  ?  the movie provides no explanation .  how did he ever become the leader ?   a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in .  two actors from the same successful tv-series .  .  .  .  a cheap way to get viewers ?
-1	i bought this movie for 1 euro ,  not knowing what it was all about .  i thought  " hmmm ,  a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore "  .  it wasn't funny alright .  it was disturbing .  very disturbing .  and i don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything ,  except that child abuse is not a good thing to do .  hmmm .  .  .  the quality of the images were terrible .  the acting .  .  . there was no acting .  just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over 90 minutes .  this is probably material for sicko's jurking off on extreme gore .   don't watch this .  it's not worth your time .  its just awful .  i wish i never bought this .   they should mutilate the guy who made this
-1	an avent-garde nightmarish ,  extremely low-budget  " film "  that has delusions of grandeur .  hard to sit through .  i get the message that child abuse is wrong .  wow big revelation .  i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this .  yes that's sarcasm .  don't watch this  " film "  if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender .  don't watch it if you're the least bit squeamish .  don't watch it if you care about acting .  on second thought just don't watch it period .   my grade :  d-  dvd extras : making the movie  ,  the premiere , interview with kristie bowersock ,  deleted scenes ,  movie stills ,  director's commentary ,  2 versions of the teaser trailer ,  music video by the azoic ,  & a classroom video experiment
-1	first of all :  i love good splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art ,  but this zero-budget-flick is none of it !  the picture-quality is so damned low ,  the soundtrack the most annoying one i ever  (  !  !  !  !  ) heard ,  and as for the fx .  .  .  well the super-low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie  ( what this junk here isn't )  .  no concept ,  a wafer-thin storyline ,  primitive acting and rare dialog - i think i counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie ,  each one repeated about 20 times .  .  .  same for a lot of film-sequences  ( may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made !  !  !  )  the story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother ,  got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring ,  performing a show of self-mutilation .  so far ,  so good .  .  .  but for these pseudo-art-idiot-directors ,  this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense  ( freshly taken-out bowels are thrown on a naked ,  bound woman in an earth-hole .  .  .  why ?  ?  and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody  " movie "  )  ?  ?  ?  disturbing ?  yes !  !  sick ?  yes !  !  necessary ?  no !  artistically ?  no !  !  !  !  !  everyone mistaking this cheap gore-show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch pink floyd's  " the wall "  to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way .  .  .  i hope this was your first and last  (  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  )  movie ,  andrew cobb .  .  .   !  !  !  !  and all you gore-heads out there ,  remember :  not everything that looks cheap and makes obviously no sense at all is automatically  " art "  .  .  .
-1	this is a good example of how not to make a film .   there is very little meaningful dialog ,  no context for the events ,  and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes .  the result is a confused ,  clueless viewer ;  the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary .   this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is ,  with an emphasis on child abuse .  it includes some stock footage of real ,  horrible acts of violence ,  including war time executions .  although it works in the context of the movie ,  i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content .  this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended ,  and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors .   the climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie .  if you're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it .   the director's commentary was a one-shot ,   " sit the guy down and let him talk ,  no cuts "  type of commentary .  while this isn't necessarily bad ,  the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college ,  filming conditions ,  co producers ,  bad film ,  and a dozen other things .  the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie .   the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget .  because of this ,  the video and audio quality is poor .  that alone does not make it a bad movie ,  but it does make a bad movie worse .
-1	it's a hideous little production ,  apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches .  it's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation .  it's weird ,  but it's not the kind of fun ,  weird trip anyone optimistic might expect .  it's the cold ,  inhuman ,  unfriendly ,  sickening ,  even creepy kind of weird .  there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie .  after all ,  disney did a fantastic job with the same source material .  and cosgrove-hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion .   interestingly ,  this is a french production .  as such ,  it re-enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary .
-1	i don't know why this has the fans it does and i don't know why i have even given it the score i have .  this is preposterous .  there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief ,  let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen .  but ,  this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack ,  even by italian standards .  not a giallo ,  this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring klaus kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances .  i reckon he turned up ,  did a day's work and cleared off leaving mr d'amato to get others to fill in .  ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough ,  and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place ,  long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle .  maybe i just wasn't in the right mood !
-1	'i don't understand .  none of this makes any sense ! ' ,  exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder .  having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie ,  i know exactly how he feels .  the story ,  by the film's director aristide massacessi  ( good old joe d'amato using his real name for a change )  ,  is a clumsy mix of the supernatural ,  murder/mystery ,  and pretentious arty rubbish ,  the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts ,  but which had me struggling to remain conscious .   opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister  ( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair ,  before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor )  ,  death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman  ( played by ewa aulin ,  who stars in the equally strange 'death laid an egg' )  is seen alive and kicking ,  the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrück .  after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home ,  where she is tended to by creepy dr .  sturges  ( klaus kinski in a throwaway role )  ,  the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr .  and mrs .  ravensbrück  ( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin' )  .   'so far ,  so good' ,  i thought to myself at this point ,  'we've had hunchbacks ,  incest ,  some blood and guts ,  and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy euro-horror ;  what follows ,  however ,  is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings ,  ghostly goings on ,  and even elements from edgar allan poe's 'the black cat' ,  to tell a very silly ,  utterly bewildering ,  and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave .   this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb ,  but given the choice ,  i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career ;  i guess incomprehensible ,  meandering ,  surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing !  2 . 5 out of 10  ( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness )  ,  rounded up to 3 for imdb .
-1	a lot of other reviewers here ,  including many whose opinions i respect ,  hold this slice of european sleaze horror in high regard .  personally ,  i didn't like it at all .  its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence .  jess franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well .  unfortunately ,  the infamous exploitation filmmaker joe d'amato does not .  d'amato's most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient .  this ,  an early film by him ,  doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious  " anthropophagous "  and  " beyond the darkness "  did .  ultimately ,  its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way .  without the sleaze factor either ,  it becomes very boring .  as i said ,  others have enjoyed this film ,  but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing .   there are a few pluses for the film .  ewa aulin  ( from  " candy "  )  is in it ,  and she looks pretty hot and is often naked .  however ,  cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film .  he seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest .  the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore .  still ,  this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring .   ( 3/10 )
-1	i saw this movie in its own time period ,  when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life ,  but stamped your child as a bastard .  in these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far-fetched ,  but it was very true .  and i'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering ,  either .  between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny .  at that time i didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had .  i did know who betty hutton was ,  and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic .  i loved  " bringing up baby "  ,  but i find this movie just embarrassing .  i'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked ,  but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again .  the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to the misery .  an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances ,  so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part .  of course ,  shoot me ,  i don't like  " it's a wonderful life "  either .
-1	this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget .  dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid ,  chase scenes are uniformly boring ,  and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes  ( a briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film's chief villain--no prop is here without a purpose )  .  the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman's studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline corman would impose .
-1	time spent watching this film was time wasted .  i do not dislike science fiction .  i do not reject any genre per se ,  since good work can be done in any genre .  this film ,  however is not good work .  i cannot fault the visuals  ( when not involving alien makeups )  ,  and the special effects are impressive .  the story was not out-and-out bad ,  for a trekkish comic book .  but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers' interest/attention/money went .  the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing  ( one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture )  .  the  " acting "  was mostly very bad indeed .  there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of  " it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad/sad/scared/whatever .  okay ,  so it was a sf series pilot .  since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium .  i'm astonished the pilot sold the series .  or is the money also in the hands of technerds ?
-1	diana guzman is an angry young woman .  surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas ,  she takes her anger out on the closest targets .   when she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club ,  she knows she's found her home .    the film progresses from there ,  as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing .  michelle rodriguez is very good in the role ,  particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism .   the picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors ,  who pale in comparison to the older ,  more experienced cast .  there are too many pauses in the script ,  which detracts from the dramatic tension .  the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity .    this is a good picture to see once ,  if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power .  its limitations prevent it from being placed in the  " see it again and again "  category .
-1	the real shame of  " the gathering "  is not in the bad acting ,  nor is it in the despicably shallow plot .  the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun ,  even though it did have one main attraction :  takashima .  i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova ,  even for just five minutes .  she has that sarcasm ,  that wit ,  that double-edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable .  sadly ,  though ,  the  " babylon 5 "  pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination .  patricia tallman-- who never seriously returned to the series until much later-- fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander ,  who here is little more than a whiny ,  tiresome telepath .  i shall leave you with one final thought-- why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer-space frog man  ( even though she is a woman )  ?  thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show .
-1	you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget ,  but the movie is still sub-par .  dont get me wrong ,  b5 the series is by far the best tv series ever ,  but if i was an exec seeing this movie ,  i wouldnt have ordered the series .  i dont like o'hare as an actor ,  the costumes are silly ,  and there are tons of cliches .  the same can be said for most of the first season  ( with the exception of babylon squared and survivors )  ;  bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle .  if you are a b5 fan and havent seen this movie ,  see it .  if you arent a b5 fan ,  dont .  .  . you wont want to watch the series .
-1	while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series ,  the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start .  although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there ,  the pace of the gathering is slow ,  the makeup somewhat inadequate ,  and the plot confusing .  worse ,  the characterization in the premiere episode is poor .  although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems ,  i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .
-1	i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part .  since i am a filmmaker ,  i give it a 2 for consistency .   the problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most ,  if not all ,  previous successful war stories .  the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story .  i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with ,  but did not find that information .   it seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged .  the actors weren't bad ,  but the plot needs more innovation .
-1	wow .  i have seen some really bad movies in my time ,  but this one truly takes the cake .  it's the worst movie i've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration .   as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan ,  i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film ,  not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at  " authenticity "  to be found anywhere in the film .  not so much as the tiniest little shred .  it seemed like it had been written by an 8 year-old child who got all his notions of war  ( and soldierly behavior )  straight out of comic books .  the film was made in honduras ,  which should have been a clue ,  but even that can't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché-ridden piece of trash .   i could try to list all the endless technical flaws ,  but it would take virtually forever .  from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii ,  and the character's name tags ,  like  " colcollins "   ( worn by the character  " colonel collins "  )  ,  which was actually spelled using the reversed ,  mirror-image  " n "  of the russian alphabet  ( not the us alphabet )  the list just goes on and on .  the uniforms ,  the equipment ,  the plot ,  and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves -- every single scene was just chock-full of ridiculous flaws ,  inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés .   neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable .  it was all laughably childish ,  in the extreme .  this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre-pubescent boys ,  and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd .   in short ,  this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all .  it's a total waste of time .  i'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by ;  it's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for .
-1	i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission ,  and let me tell you ,  you'll watch anything under those circumstances .  not this piece of sh*t though .   the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn-movie quality acting ,  weird out-of-the-blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior .  it gets worse after that .  this movie does not have one single saving grace ,  and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch .  it's just horrible .  i've seen quite many movies in my life and i'm not one of those snobby know-all critics ,  i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad .  this one .  .  .  man .   steer _well_ clear of this one ,  my friend .
-1	dont let the mpaa fool you with their  " rated r for extreme violence "  there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t .  i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised ,  however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense .  avoid !
-1	my wife is a fanatic as regards this show .  that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order .  i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad .  alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy ,  embrace of the vampire to name a few ,  the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals .  i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child .  i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not .  please .  please don't renew for another season as enough is enough ,  bob
-1	***slight spoilers***  a hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time .  after the act ,  he lays in the bed with her not touching her .  the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years .   this is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality ,  or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency .   however ,  as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother .   at one point ,  his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be ,   " every step of the way in this ,  my son has been amazing .  .  .  i have never been more proud of him .  .  .  "   the young father's older sister ,  who otherwise is cold towards her brother ,  begins to show pride in her sibling ,   " you have been cool about this ,  "  as she gives him an encouraging warm hug .   the 15-year-old father wants to be a father .  he wants to be a parent .   why not ?  we see the  " new "  baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy ,  happy 4-month-old infant .  just as babies were born on tv in the 1960's and 1970's .   once the young father is a parent ,  he has found happiness .  he insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper .  we see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder .  fade to black .
-1	i had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school .  as figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new .  though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through .  it had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original .  we have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him ,  we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust ,  then we have the father who is always gone .  then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does .  on to the story like i said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling .  everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl ,  they get together ,  have sex and then boom we have a little kid .  perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved i've seriously gotten more emotion out of leatherface and his chainsaw than i did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted .  so far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie i've seen was juno .  so far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message .  like i said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity .  i really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential .
-1	i'm sorry ,  i had high hopes for this movie .  unfortunately ,  it was too long ,  too thin and too weak to hold my attention .  when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream ,  i felt cheated .  surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper ,  something more meaningful .   so ,  don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room .  my kids didn't enjoy it either .  ah well .
-1	with the exception of family ,  this new season is worse than season one .  i can't imagine what they are thinking .  as a fan of horror ,  can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem ,  but this series gets worse with each outing .  i can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day ,  toiling to churn out such crap .  story !  is that too much to ask for ?  character !  how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories ?  if we are not engaged ,  who cares if they get carved up or whatever ?  almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting ,  going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting .  even dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion .  ironically ,  the production values and performances tend to be up to speed ,  while the content is utter crap .  i have great hopes for exec producer's garris's valarie under the stairs ,  but we shall see .
-1	honestly , the concept behind  " masters of horror "  had something going for it .  big-time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again ,  i was all for it from the start .  that is ,  until i watched some episodes .  .  .  oh boy ,  it's really bad tv .  not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits ,  but there seems to be guidelines as well ,  like shooting in hd for example .  to make a long story short ,  it's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons .  i cannot help but compare to the  " tales from the crypt "  ,  and the m . o . h .  episodes really don't stand the comparison .  tftc was good ,  moh is bad ;  according to me here are a few keys to explain it :  tftc was shorter  ( around 25 minutes for each episode )  than moh  ( 50 minutes per episode )  ,  i believe it allowed denser screenplays ,  with good ideas reoccurring more often ,  better overview of an episode ,  less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring .  duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on tftc :  directors got to have real film music composers  ( composers on moh are if inexistent ,  very bad )  ,  real actors  ( whereas on moh it's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor !  )  ,  real directors of photography and ,  it can help sometimes ,  real film cameras  ( while moh is shot on hd cameras with very wrongly chosen lens-pieces )  ,  the result of which being that the episodes of tftc looked and felt  " cinematographic "  in the sense that there was real actors being casted ,  ranging from michael j .  fox to tim roth to kyle mclachlan to kirk douglas ,  but there were also film composers behind it ,  of the range of alan silvestri ,  great directors of photography like dean cundey ,  high-end screenplay writers ,  and in that sense each  " tale "  was a little movie of its own true kind .  compared to tftc ,  the  " masters of horrors "  is quite a lame approach to tv horror .  it's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average ,  because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial ,  if not worse .  it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast ,  within the first 10 minutes usually .  the actors are never-heard before wannabes  ( except for fairuza balk ,  robert englund ,  angela bettis and a few ,  but even there ,  they are the only famous actors of their episodes )  .  the director base for moh was good in the beginning ,  but it's getting worst and worst with every episode :  now if even the directors are unknown to the world ,  what remains ?  nothing !  and it's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven't even had ,  say ,  stan winston ,  dick maas ,  william lustig ,  sam raimi ,  eric red ,  robert harmon ,  william friedkin ,  jim muro ,  stuart gordon ,  russell mulcahy .  .  .  if even  " masters of horror "  cannot bring dead directors back to life ,  who will ?  maybe a rerun of tales from the crypt will .
-1	i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 .  the premise was very simple and appealing :  each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous ,  noteworthy horror director .  then ,  when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown .  some good episodes emerged from that first season ,  but all in all it was a mixed bag .  i attributed it to the learning curve ,  and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better .   boy ,  was i in for a shock .  at least season one had a few good stories here and there .  season 2  ( with the exception of  " the black cat "  starring the excellent jeffrey combs )  was a complete and total loss to me .  the episode  " sounds like "  may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years ,  and most of the other episodes aren't much better .  i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year ,  but i'm not holding my breath .
-1	some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series .  particularly the writing .  ok ,  the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink .  i'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage .  nothing new or genuinely interesting .  few of them are visually creative .  it's just typical fabricated hollywood crap ,  uninteresting ,  childish ,  poorly conceived and in some cases ,  flat out laughable .  much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity !  other then that this series blows hard .  i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth-graders to write the episodes .  maybe they did .
-1	horror fans  ( i'm speaking to the over 12's ,  although if you're under 12 i apologise for what you might deem an insult )  :  in short ,  if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written ,  original storytelling ,  punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares ,  and delivered via convincing performances ,  then i can heartily recommend - avoiding these steamers - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date .  it's no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980's .  not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys  ( or indeed the 80's )  because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of argento ,  carpenter ,  landis ,  dante and barker  ( actually clive ,  wtf are you doing in there ?  !  glad to see romero had the good sense to give it a miss as i'm sure he was asked to partake .  .  .  )  .  more perhaps we should point the finger at creator mick garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised tv remake of stanley kubrick's masterpiece 'the shining' .   perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today .  are we so starved of good tv horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets ?  sadly ,  maybe so .   normally i wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't argue the faults and merits of a production ,  i'd just rate it accordingly .  however ,  as this series is woefully lacking in any merit  ( with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune )  i write this as more of a warning than a review :  don't waste your time and money .  if you disagree with me then it's more than likely that you haven't seen enough decent horror .  perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start ,  but if these 'masters' of horror were being assessed on these works alone ,  they'd never have been allowed to graduate with even their bachelor's degree .  unless of course they were studying for a degree from the university of s**t .
-1	according to imdb takashi miike's master of horror-segment ,  imprint ,  was banned in the us .  so i figured i'd translate the swedish review i just wrote for it .  .  .   it was hard to not have any sort of expectations from ichi the killer-director takashi miike's episode in the masters of horror series .  and the dvd-cover of imprint did in deed look very promising .   the story mostly takes place in a remote japanese bordello ,  some time during the 19th century ,  and it tells the tale of a journalist searching for komomo ,  the woman he left behind and whom he promised to return for .  tired and dejected he arrives at the bordello ,  hoping that this will be the end of his very long journey .  it turns out that one of the prostitutes ,  a deformed and quiet girl ,  know about komomo ,  and the desperate man makes her tell him where she is and what has happened to her since he left .  the story she tells him is as deplorable as it is hard to swallow .  .  .   the first thing that hit me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the japanese cast for the most part spoke fluent american-english .  but i will leave it at that ,  it's not that big a deal .  what is a big deal however is how miserable the rest of it was .  miike's tale moves at such a slow pace that i couldn't help looking at my watch several times during the 63 minutes .  the extended torure-scene ,  that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie ,  felt so unmotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even that scene became interesting .  i felt like it was violent just for the sake of violence itself - with no sense of style or purpose .  the only scenes that provoked any kind of emotion out of me were the images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the swiftly flowing water .  .  . and ,  in all honesty ,  the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust .   the journalist seeking the love he left behind is played by billy drago ,  for me most memorable as frank nitti - al capones whiteclad assassin in brian de palmas the untouchables  ( 1987 )  .  i've always found dragos portrayal of nitti to be very icy  ( and i mean that in a good way )  ,  and that is probably why i was almost annoyed when i found him to be so terrible  ( not in a good way )  in this one .  his acting seems to flow between no feelings or empathy whatsoever to displays of some really bad overacting .  when his character is supposed to react to the awful things komomo has been subjected to i was sitting in the sofa ,  twisting and turning in an attempt to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago .  i'm grateful that most of the story is told by yuoki kudoh  ( memoirs of a geisha ,  2005 )  ,  who plays the deformed prostitute .   the finale is probably supposed to be chocking ,  maybe even revolting and horrid ,  but i just found it to be kind of .  .  . you know .  .  .   " blah "   ( and i looked at my watch again ,  for the umptieth time ,  just wishing the crappy episode would end )  .  maybe the finale caused me to smile just a bit ,  but that's only because i couldn't help thinking of an episode of red dwarf ,  and the upside-down chins of craig charles and danny john-jules ,  with eyes glued on them to make them look like aliens .  .  .  lucky you ,  if you've seen that episode and now decide to see imprint ,  i will forever have ruined the visuals of the ending for you .   my first thought ,  when imprint finally ended ,  was that the only thing that made the pain of watching it worth it ,  was hearing the main title theme by edward shearmur  ( the same music i believe is used in every episode of this series )  ,  and that - if anything - is a big friggin warning ,  don't you think ?   one might point to the costume design ,  by michiko kitamura ,  and say that there ,  at least ,  is something not lacking in style and refinement .  .  . but there are so many other films and tv-shows that is so much better at showing off the japanese  " geisha-fashion "  .  this is nothing but inferior and i am disappointed .  takashi miike's masters of horror-episode is boring ,  uninspiring and pointless .  in other words ;  it's really ,  really bad !
-1	i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap .  i had wanted to see it for ages ,  finding the plot outline very intriguing .  so my disappointment was great ,  to say the least .  i thought the lead actor was very flat .  this kind of part required a performance like johny depp's in the ninth gate  ( of which this is almost a complete rip-off )  ,  but i guess tv budgets don't always stretch to this kind of acting ability .   i also the thought the direction was confused and dull ,  serving only to remind me that carpenter hasn't done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness .  as for the story - well ,  i was disappointed there as well !  there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess ,  but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor ,  and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the least .   this was written by one of the main contributors to aicn ,  and you can tell he does love his cinema ,  but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise .   i took the dvd back to the store the same day !
-1	there was not one original idea in this story .  themes were pulled from various sources ;  a few being the ninth gate ,  in the mouth of madness  ( another carpenter film )  ,  and the ring .  it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film's namesake .  the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria .  hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around .  yes ,  i saw that the theater was playing argento's deep red .  claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out .  this was bottom-of-the-barrel .  throwing gore and  " disturbing "  imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film .  carpenter used to know that .  he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine .
-1	no fireworks despite violent action .   science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed ,  largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention ,  and unfortunately for its producers ,  this work is lacking on both counts ,  woefully so in the case of the latter .  with essentially no budget with which to operate ,  it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and ,  in particular ,  special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish ,  while seeds from the scriptors' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found .  among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment ,  and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly ,  but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility .  the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth ,  with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first-timer paolo mazzucato ,  whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus .
-1	at first i was convinced that this was a made-for-tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime .  but after a few minutes of dumb-struck awe ,  i realized that there was at least comic value in the over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting .  this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face .  it was like a less-funny spy version of the big hit  ( i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd )  with even-worse acting .  we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena ,  and not jim ,  after all of the hugging and high-fives .  a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier .
-1	i'm sorry to say this ,  but the acting in this film is horrible .  the dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever .  perhaps i got the  " dress rehearsal "  version by mistake .  the director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves .  the story is pretty well written ,  and the fight sequences are actually better than i have seen in many action films .  the fights seem pretty real .  but all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire ,  grenades ,  morter rounds ,  and bazookas .  the enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots i have ever seen ,  especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards ,  and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet .  those bazookas need serious site calibration .
-1	the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic .  everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out .  i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn .  i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene :  jim :  watch your ass nick :  you watch yours  ( together )  :  i wont leave you behind !   the first action sequence shows how awful the production is ,  but its really kind of funny :  good guys have transformer weapons !  in one scene ,  they all have fake hk mp5 sub-machine guns .  next scene ,  ak-47 replicas !  and then ,  to top it all off ,  they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of m-16s !  !  i think they had a budget shortage for guns ,  not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys .  fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell .  you have to remove the pin/spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own .  you can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter .  weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re-appear .  when a gun is out of bullets ,  throwing it away is still pretty stupid .  unless you have no idea how to reload them .  .  big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes .  i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced .  this movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk .
-1	early ,  heavy ,  war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices ,  in effort to prevent any runaway inflation .   using scare ,  guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric ,  which was normal for the time ,  the government was concern that the sudden war-time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war .   it truly is a window into the past ,  historically and culturally .
-1	this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline .  the problem is ,  frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l .  paul bremer in to tell his side of the story .  more troubling is the fact that the director of the film ,  charles ferguson--a former think tank wonk ,  was a war supporter until the occupation went south .  what did he think would happen ?    the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis . and that is what this film feels like--an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself .    ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better--as if any war can be better .
-1	there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology ,  which is extremely flawed .  it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis ,  which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe .   journalism 101 :  tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable .  for instance ,  the idea of civil war ,  chaos ,  looting ,  etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following hussein's demise :  were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture ?  doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself ,  rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure ?  would they rather the us have declared marshall law ?  i'm sure the papers here would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force .   aside from the analytical idiocy of the film ,  it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming  " so-and-so refused to be interviewed .  .  .  "  yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received .  would you ,  as vice president ,  deign to be interviewed by a first time writer/producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words .  they couldn't roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions ,  perhaps they never watched her hearing .   this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there .  this is another biased ,  asinine approach by journalists - which are ,  by and large ,  unthinking herds .   anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary .  these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think .
-1	this movie was so bad that my i . q .  went down about 40 points after seeing it .  it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it .  it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme .
-1	universal soldier :  the return is not the worst movie ever made .  no ,  that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner .  however ,  perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier :  the return .    this film is a sci-fi/action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it .  the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen .  the plot is terrible and predictable .  the special effects are pathetic .  in short ,  anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves .  us :  the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces .  some movies are so bad ,  they're good .  believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them .  i'm really not sure what else to say here .  i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already ,  but just in case :  don't .
-1	this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie .  cheap looking ,  and worst of all ,  boring action scenes !  the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence .  only 82 minutes ,  but it feels like it goes on forever !  even die-hard van damme fans ( like myself )  should avoid this one !
-1	we open with colonel luc deveraux  ( van damme )  ,  the original universal soldier and his buxom asian friend being chased down a river by what appear to be universal soldiers .  they almost kill the two ,  then oh wait ,  it was just a field test .  deveraux we come to find is now part of a government funded company that designs the new level of universal soldiers .  why he would want to be involved in this  ( if you know anything about the original )  is never explained and well beyond me .   it's after this flimsy set piece that the real story gets going .  the united states government has cut the universal soldier's project budget and in the process angered seth  ( the large artificial mainframe computer that controls the universal soldiers )  .  naturally he won't be shut down without a fight .  so that means van damme has to go around and take all the new breed of universal soldiers out .  which sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a take on a sequel ,  but that doesn't stop it from becoming stupid as hell .    for instance ,  one of the new universal soldiers is played by bill goldberg .  seems you can't go wrong casting a wrestler in an action movie .  he's big ,  he's tough ,  right ?  wrong .  van damme doesn't seem to have a problem wiping the floor with him .  .  .  once  .  .  .  twice  .  .  .  three times .  the point here lost on me .  then there's the breaking of glass .  a rudimentary part of any action movie ,  but someone involved must have a glass fetish .  you have to see the fight scenes in particular .  let's not talk about how nobody cuts themselves or at the very least slips .  then to put the cherry on top of this train wreck ,  they have seth  ( the computer )  secure a human body for himself and how appropriate it is when they make the villain black  ( michael jai white )  .  nothing works better than a white good guy fighting a black bad guy it would seem .  potentially offensive and just downright lame .  he's no replacement for dolph ,  either .   universal soldier 2 is a lousy sequel .  it's loud ,  it's dumb and it doesn't care .  the original wasn't anything poetic ,  but it made a simple sort of sense with a science fiction element and it entertained on a basic level .  the sequel doesn't .  they do however keep the running time under ninety minutes and somehow found a way to squeeze in a strip club sequence .  so give credit where credit is due .
-1	i first heard of unisol 2 when i drove past a cinema when i was on holiday in america .  i really did not take much notice of it until i bought the original on dvd which led me to find out about its three sequels .  i subsequently started to read about the return on the imdb and asked friends what they thought of it .  despite their horrific criticisms of it ,  i still went out of my way to see it and was on the brink of buying it until i saw it for hire on dvd .  i wasn't expecting much but thought that it must have been half decent to get a theatrical release in the us ,  after all ,  how often is it that you see van damme on the big screen ?  well ,  nothing could have prepared me for this .  it is so bad i almost cried .  what a total waste of 80 minutes and £2 . 50 .  it is hard to explain how bad this move is .  honestly .  this is idiotic film making .  no ,  it's more than idiotic .  i just cannot believe how this got made .  i cannot believe that someone out there has not murdered mic rogers .  how stupid can people possibly be - firstly ,  van damme actually thinking the script and finished film was good .  secondly ,  the fact that xander berkley ,  of terminator 2 and air force one status ,  commited himself to this film .  i simply cannot believe the stupidity of this movie .  it takes itself so seriously but comes across to the audience like a spoof .  here is an example :  jcvd's daughter  ( yes ,  luc is now a human again ) -  " i want my daddy "  ,  seth-  " so do i "  .  oh yeah ,  and some guy tries to shut down seth by pulling three huge levers with - wait for it - on and off written on them .  the acting all round is like playschool acting .  i'm sure mr director modelled luc's reporter girlfriend on april o'neil from the cartoon teenage mutant hero turtles - she refuses to go because she ' .  .  . needs her story' .  i mean come on - how many cliches can a film possibly use ?  please listen to me fellow imdb users - don't touch this with a barge pole .  to conclude ,  universal soldier :  the return has no relation whatsoever to the first movie .  in fact ,  if they weren't called unisols then you would never know it was a sequel .  luc is now a human again - what the hell !  ?  !  the only place in which he can access the internet is in a stripclub .  all the new uni sols look like they were dragged off the street ,  they are that unconvincing .  this is pure torture to watch ,  so do yourself a favour - don't torture yourself .  p . s - best part of the movie :  romeo jumps off a building and shouts 'oh sh*t' .
-1	i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it .  the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony .  they fly to the moon in a space-age dustbin carrier ;  when there ,  they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbase .   it strikes me that rubbish low-budget sci-fi films often involve either desert planets or ,  like this movie ,  criminals escaping from penal colonies .  why this is i have no idea .  but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical .  this one is really no exception .  it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half-way alright dance music soundtrack .  it then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller .  so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review ,  so if you're reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film's subtleties and nuances .  for the record ,  i recall a tedious bunch of baddies ,  a tedious bunch of goodies ,  some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman .  other than that ,  i'm struggling .   if you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film .  i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets .
-1	the infamous ed wood  " classic "  plan 9 from outer space features an indignant alien calling the human race ,   "  .  .  . stupid !  stupid ,  stupid stupid !  "  i'd have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie ,  a ridiculously silly sci-fi film .   falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie ,  luke ,  a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers .  while van damme was too big to reprise the role in the first two sequels ,  he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around .  so ,  probably cursing under his breath the whole way ,  he kicks and grunts and scowls through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks .  you'll find plenty of mindless violence ,  but i'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing .  otherwise ,  you are liable to forget where you left it by the time it's over .   luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth  ( makes hal look like ghandi )  turns all the other universal soldiers into evil ,  remorseless killers .  of course this is what these things are programmed to do ,  but in this case they are killing their creators ,  not  " the enemy "  so that's a problem .   i love the dumb logic of this movie .  logic that believes that a supercomputer would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael jai white does to be in this movie .  logic that dictates that the creator of seth be a blue-haired cyber-stereotype geek who spouts cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam .  logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate panes of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time .   the film also features a daughter in peril character ,  wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier ,  and a romance so tacked on ,  i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing .  and when this movie ends ,  it ends .  not a minute after a gigantic towering finale-style explosion are the credits running .  no epilogue ,  no where are they now ,  no final kiss ,  just explosion ,  hug ,  over .  even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible .   while it's no plan 9 ,  us : tr is a silly little trifle of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of rowdy van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths .  not to be seen on a serious stomach .
-1	i was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film .  i didn't enjoy the first one at all ,  and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports !  after managing to sit through it all ?  avoid ,  avoid ,  avoid !  !
-1	i'm sorry for jean ,  after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career .  this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg ( romeo )  and whatever that computers name was .  also ,  some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary .  truly ,  bad movie .
-1	van damme .  what else can i say ?  bill goldberg .  there we go .  now we know this movie is going to be really horrible .   i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs ,  knowing it would be bad .  but not even i thought it would be this bad .  the plot is awful ,  van damme is getting old  ( finally )  ,  but unlike arnold ,  his movies are as well .   forget this movie .  don't see it .  ever .  i wouldn't even be paid to see this film .   1/5 stars - at its heart lies a wonderful ,  action-packed thrill ride .    well ,  maybe not ,  but the marketers would sure like us to think so ,  wouldn't they ?   john ulmer
-1	this movie was absolutly awful .  i can't think of one thing good about it .  the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them .  the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed ,  and that is saying alot !  !  !  and dialogue ,  what dialogue ?  ?  ? to think that i was a fan of the first one  ( i use that comment loosely ,  its more like a guilty pleasure ,  than anything else )  .  this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud !  !  !  !  nothing good can come of this movie .  what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of !  !  !  this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time .  2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1 .
-1	this is a piece of s--t !  !  this looks worse than a made for t . v .  movie .  and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results .  .  .  war is prettier than this .  jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now .  no script ,  no story and no time should be wasted on this .  i mean that .  1 out of 10 is too high ,  way too high .  goldberg should be jackhammered for this .  van shame is no actor .
-1	** here be spoilers **  the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program ,  now called unisol .  the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before .  however the government is downsizing ,  the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened ,  so he takes steps to ensure his own safety .  he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem .  the only one who can stop them is deveraux  ( van damme )  .    this movie is about one thing .  choreographed fighting .  the story is bad ,  and is soon drowned in all fights .  whatever happens ,  and wherever they go ,  they fight .  unfortunately for this movie ,  it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible .  normally you're pretty sure the hero will win ,  but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants .  not where one is indestructible and can't lose .  then the fights just become a tool to stretch time .  you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes .  to further lower my opinion ,  a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are .  well ,  there aren't really that lot of them ,  because the characters are most men  ( there are at least one woman unisol though )  ,  but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once .  the female leads get by with this ,  but we also pass through a strip-club  ( to use a computer no less )  with much more undressed women .  these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience .   so ,  in conclusion ,  boring fights .  no more ,  no less .  well ,  maybe less .  .  .   2/10
-1	i'll be honest .  the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it's in the imdb bottom 100 .  and right now ,  i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on that same list .   van damme is luc deveraux ,  who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'hal' to defend itself .  and yes ,  after all the obligate explosions ,  shoot-outs and chases he is the last one standing .  combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set-up it makes sure it's place in the infamous list is just .   only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list .  2/10 .
-1	this is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller .  in the original ,  van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers  ( unisols )  .  in this one ,  it's ,  i guess ,  about a dozen years later ,  since van damme has a daughter about that age .  now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols - codenamed unisol 2500 ,  for some reason .  as usual ,  something goes wrong :  the on-site super-computer  ( named seth - like the snake in  " king cobra "  the same year )  goes power-crazy ,  takes command of the unisols ,  and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-unisol body  ( jai white )  .  we're lookin' at the next step in evolution ,  folks !  most of van damme's fights are with one particularly mean unisol  ( pro wrestler goldberg )  who just keeps on comin' :  drop him off a building - no good ;  run him down with a truck - no go !  shoot him ,  burn him - forgetaboutit !  much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out-classed ( he's even going grey around the edges )  .  but ,  though he takes a lickin' ,  he keeps on kickin' !  most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals ,  and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius ,  it manages to be consistently entertaining ,  especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan .
-1	this movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because jean-claud vam damme stars in this movie . there are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie .   the acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors bill goldberg and michael jai white can not act at all . and this movie by far has to be one of jean-claud vam dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch blood sport , kickboxer or sudden death .   over all this movie is crap/ok and my rating is 4 out of 10 .
-1	i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn't make it to the end credits .  first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest .  second time i managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting ,  lame sfx and extremely poor direction .  pales in comparison to the original .   anyone ever hear about the old et atari 2600 fiasco ?  for those who haven't let me fill you in .  it's 1982 .  .  . et is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time .  .  . atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system .  to cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of atari 2600 et games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them .   what does universal soldier :  the return have to do with this story ?  look at the 3 . 2 rating and figure it out for yourself .   awful film .  .  . imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives .
-1	this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world .  i'm pretty sure it was double team ,  which convinced everyone that jean-claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks .  however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever .  while universal soldier : the return isn't as dull as double team or the quest , it's still pretty awful indeed ,  with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing .  this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling .  as i look back ,  not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud .  in other words another clunker in van damme's assembly line .   * out of 4 ( bad )
-1	ok ,  so it was written in 1996 ,  before 9/11 ,  so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world ,  is prescient .  that's it .  that's the good stuff .  the acting .  .  . fair .  the plot .  .  . silly .  the  " twist "  .  .  .  unnecessary .  dooooooooooom it isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated .  don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for  " plagues "  and how to contain them ?  proper execution of such a plan is always a problem ,  as we saw after katrina .  but they have a plan .  it isn't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania .  and if the virus is carried in the air ,  why was the plane door open and the  " shooters' standing there with no protection ?  in fact ,  did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ?  that would stop her .  but not as dramatic .  i'm a sucker .  i always watch a movie to see the end ,  once i started it .  but this was a waste of time ,  and for the most part ,  predictable .  i saw it using a recorder so i didn't have to watch all the ads ,  that was a plus .  it's a good example of why i watch so little network tv .  rubbish .
-1	this was an atrocious waste of my time .  no plot .  the acting was so far below par ,  it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do .  it is merely a commercial rip-off of the earlier universal soldier ,  which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel .  its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years ,  and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it .  this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name .  by comparison ,  it makes segall ,  norris ,  and arnold look almost talented .   perhaps vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send-ups of his genre .  at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him .
-1	after seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the  " universal soldier "  franchise ,  i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie .  well ,  it seemed this prayer was answered ,  but not the way i hoped .  universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library .  no ,  even that would be more intriguing  .  the fight sequences are top-notch ,  bruce lee quality ,  which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture .  that and having former wcw tough-guy legend  " goldberg "  playing the villain .  however ,  placing goldberg as seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better .   we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself .  it's like some film school students slapped it together .  the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west's ego is what really did this movie in .  for example :  luc's daughter ,  hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago .  how is that possible ?  tell me that !  the part in which luc's partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re-goddamn diculous !  you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie .  c'mon .  the director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut .  but oooh nooo !    speaking of the plot ,  it sucks !  compared to the first movie ,  universal soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless .  where's the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something  ?  this was the dawn of the millennium ,  you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia/orwellian type of future cesspit .  corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad ,  sad ,  sad sequel .    from what i seen :  double impact ,  under siege 2 ,  robocop 3 ,  and hell ,  even the cheap-ass/no class terminator knock-off  " class of 1999 "  is more entertaining than this !
-1	jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier .  but ,  did that movie saved him ?  i think he goes to hell ,  after he dies .    in the first minute ,  we see the inside of a facility ,  where you can see the bad guy of the film .  scary ,  huh ?  but not as scary as the acting  ( details are following )  .    then ,  we see van damme with a black girl  ( do not remember the name .  .  .  . well it doesn't matter anyway )  ,  trying to escape from some muscle-men .  of course they are the new universal-soldiers .  more muscels ,  less brain  ( just like the movie )  .  after a while ,  van damme fights goldberg but then the  " mission "  gets aborted .  it was just a test  ( is this movie a test for our nerves ?  )  .  it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project  ( who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing ,  that yould van dammes character could do )  .  but it is a sequel .  and a  " story "  has to come up .  ah ,  i forgot .  he has a daughter .  very important for the  " story "  .   well ,  after about 20 minutes ,  a super computer hears a conversation about shutting it down and quitting he project .  of course the cube gets angry and activates all soldiers to kill everyone .  van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him  ( it wants van damme as a soldier - because he is the best  ( really ?  )  )  .  and guess what ,  goldberg is one of the hunters ,  who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets asskicked .  funny ?  yes ,  just like the rest of the film .    after some  " story "  ,  van damme tries to rescue his daughter  ( of his wife - the reporter in the first movie )  .  it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie  ( please see for yourself .  it is just too funny to tell )  .   you'll see that this movie is a waste of time .   so do not watch it .  but if you do ,  keep a sixpack with you !
-1	i don't think any movie of van damme's will ever beat universal soldier but u never know .  this movie was good but not as good as 1st .  vd returns a luc & must do battle again .  he tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle .  vd has a kid this time from ally w .  ,  good it showed a pic of them 2 .  goldberg was cool ,  he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling-sucks .  vd & goldberg had some good fights .  it was the ending like the 1st but just not that good .  vd does his best move in his career ,  like always-the helicopter kick .  even though ,  the final ending should've been longer .  anyway ,  it is worth seeing but it will never top the original .
-1	ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it's unisol's best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie ,  who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him ,  to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new ,  stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated ,  intelligent ,  and agile .  all of the new unisols ,  which are faster and stronger than their predecessors ,  are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth ,  a self-evolving thought helix .  when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts ,  he takes matters into his own  " hands "  to protect himself .  killing those who try to shut off his power ,  and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers ,  led by the musclebound romeo ,  seth spares deveraux ,  only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours .  with the help of a hacker named squid ,  seth takes human form .  not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin ,  who won't leave his side ,  but luc also must contend with general radford ,  who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth .  seth has also kidnapped luc's injured 13-year-old daughter hillary ,  and is now holding her hostage .  luc is the only person who can rescue hillary ,  because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks ,  feels ,  and fights .  now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him .  with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and reform him  ( terminator 2 )  .  another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it's completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is .  the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that .  the good points are there's no dolph  ( hooray )  and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many  ( i'm still haunted by the scenes in #1 )  also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists  ( if you don't believe me look it up )
-1	the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel .  since the real star ,  dolph lundgren ,  would not be able to reprise his role from the original ,  there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off .  bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white .  to their credit ,  they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement .  bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film ,  and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role .  for once ,  his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times ,  and it does not get irritating .  the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films .  and therein lies the problem .  you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action .  you go because you want comedy ,  however unintentional .   unbeknownst to many people ,  universal soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels .  i have only seen the first ,  which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke .  matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career ,  the sight of jean-claude van damme comes as a welcome relief .  the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels ,  and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original .  after years of investigation and explanation ,  the unisol project is still going ahead ,  with some minor modifications .  for one ,  the new unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins .  for another ,  all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth .  in the early parts of the film ,  seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome .   being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes ,  we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut .  the unisol project is on the chopping block ,  which essentially means that seth will be turned off .  seth ,  somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained ,  decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down .  his only problem is that every so often ,  a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown .  two individuals possess the code in question .  seth kills the first in short order ,  and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be .  the rest of the film revolves around the unisols' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly .  a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film ,  but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting .   the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés .  when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white ,  we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over .  he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness ( es )  .  gee ,  seth ,  you mean they will not be our strong points ?  all kidding aside ,  the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength .  it leaves the action without adequate setup .  in the original ,  we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols ,  how they work ,  and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film .  here ,  the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate .  at least in the original ,  a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice .  here ,  one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform  ( and presumably his body )  ,  getting up every time without stopping for breath .   i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner .  if you can see it on the cheap ,  knock yourself out .  this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre .
-1	terrible acting by potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever .  and as for the feminist polemic ,  it's laughable .  i saw this garbage when it was first released and though i found it tedious beyond belief i'm glad i did go to see it .  that's because i now have an immediate answer to the question 'what's the worst film you've ever seen ? ' plus ,  i have the comfort of knowing that every film i see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson .  but i have to admit i was impressed with the way potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world  ( as is revealed in the closing credits )  .   i only very recently saw orlando and i can see how potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film .  all it took was a bunch of frilly costumes ,  a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady ,  and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public .  so why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is the tango lesson ?
-1	wow what a great premise for a film  :  set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons  .  hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango .  gosh i wish i had that knack for genius  .  yes i`m being sarcastic .   it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made  .  come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan  (  i do concede they do exist judging by the comments  )  or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club  (   ?   )  there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it  .  even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road   coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen  .  gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters  ,  weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company  ,  fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body  .  the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie  ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
-1	the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films .  my gawd !   to me ,  this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art .  yes ,  it's beautifully photographed ,  but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself .  tango is a tease ,  it's hot ,  it has drama ,  it's audacious -- precisely what this film is not .
-1	this is the worst movie i have ever seen ,  and i have seen quite a few movies .  it is passed off as an art film ,  but it is really a piece of trash .  it's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing ,  but that cannot make up for sally potter's disgustingly obvious tribute to herself .  the plot of this movie is nonexistent ,  and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end .  especially where she starts singing .  it's absolutely unreal .
-1	in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass ,  this film was probably quite revealing in its day .  however ,  i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica's bag ,  since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country .  after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage ,  toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan .  he organises the inhabitants into community action ,  and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables .  that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me ,  as these people have far more important things to think about ,  like where the next pot noodle is going to come from .  anyway ,  de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are .  it's all down to capitalism of course ,  and in order to illustrate this ,  he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land .  brilliant !  to his credit ,  though ,  by this time he has given up on making a serious film ,  and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures ,  all fur coats and cigars .  they want that land ,  but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense .  by a bizarre stroke of luck ,  his old ,  deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove .  he uses it to shower gifts on his mates ,  who prove just as greedy as the cigar men .  i reckon this film was a missed opportunity .  to address the theme of poverty  ,  as not many film-makers had done until then ,  and then get caught up in a fairy tale ,  to me seems a bit daft .  how come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here ?  hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks .  de sica ,  however ,  is proclaimed as a genius for this .  surely the fact that these people are so poor ,  that their faith is unswerving ,  and that miracles never happen to them ,  is enough for any story-teller to work on .
-1	strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat ,  uninspiring drivel .  if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter ,  wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance ?  her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes ,  which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance ,  were instead awkward and painful to watch .  obviously ,  revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting ,  and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness .
-1	dire .  just dire .  the script is contrived ,  the acting painful ,  and the story just drags along .  it is ,  without a doubt ,  a celebration of sally potter and little else .  this wouldn't be so bad ,  but she's the director ,  writer and star of the film ,  and so is just self-glorification .  i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters ,  and the ending came not a moment too soon .  it has two redeeming features .  first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely ,  particularly in paris ,  and look rather good in black and white .  secondly ,  whether you're a fan of tango or not ,  the music is by and large ,  excellent  ( except where sally starts singing )  .  watch this film at your own risk ,  or if you need an unintentional laugh .  i am sure it appeals to someone .  statistically ,  it has to .
-1	probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better  " orlando "  ,  potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way :  she writes ,  directs ,  stars ,  and actually co-writes the music ,  including a mawkish love song .  the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her .  but potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable ,  and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango .  perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked .  she just can't act ,  whether playing herself or not .  pretentious ,  over-ambitious ,  dull ,  and silly .
-1	the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims .  on the surface ,  it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface ,  what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape .  aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman .  she needs a man to help her .  when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her ,  she does not stand up for herself .  it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying .   the director  ( satish kaushik )  went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive .  what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way .  the director is famous for being chauvinistic .  his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles .  he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial ,  it does not mean that the character herself is strong .   the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya 'cleans' herself after just being raped .  she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty .  though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light ,  what he does not show us is whether ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing .  thus we are left with a confusing message about rape .   the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this .  even more so ,  the comedy is simply not funny .  ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout .  the music is mediocre except for the title track ,  which is beautifully picturised  ( the only bright point of this film )  .  sonali bendre's role is disappointing and pointless .  overall ,  what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish-mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion .
-1	.  .  . but a lousy film .  as maltin says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film .  well ,  it is serious .  .  . too serious !  the plot is silly and slow  ( something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality )  .  .  . the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again .  i actually dozed off a few times !  the film is sooooo dull !  the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee .  .  . but this was probably a labor of love for both  ( they often complained about horror movies being too violent .  .  . well ,  this has no violence !  )  .  avoid at all costs .  .  . unless you have insomnia .  .  . this will put you to sleep !
-1	in spite of having some exciting  ( and daring )  sequences ,  nbtn just never gets going .  there are exploding boats ,  hat pin murders ,  mass suicides ,  pathologists with body parts ,  and all sorts of classic mystery/horror scenes ,  but they're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition .  everybody in the movie looks bored .  this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed .   add to this the  " too-proper "  brit characters and you feel like you've drifted into a sherlock holmes movie .   finally ,  the cinematography is very ordinary .  there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside ,  or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire ,  but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull .   definitely only for lee and cushing fans .
-1	i won't add to the plot reviews ,  it's not very good .   very improbable orphanage on bala .   cushing and lee at their height .   some nice scenery .   good for face spotting ,  and i quote ,   " look at the mouth ,  that is cassie from fools and horses "  .   otherwise ,  a poor example of the british film industry .   fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock ,  keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best .   redeeming feature ?  it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription .  i won't be subscribing on this effort .
-1	i actually have a fondness for christopher lee ,  but this just wasn't up to his other performances .  .  .  and he was one of the better actors .   the film does not live up to its premise .  it's not that scary ,  it's overly melodramatic ,  and it draaaaaags .  every time i thought ,   " oh ,  here comes the good part "  the good part never quite arrived .   the evil ones aren't at all convincing .  most of the other characters were also lacking in depth .   perhaps if i'd been in the proper frame of mind ,  i might have enjoyed some mstie-fication at this film's expense ,  but .  .  .  .  naaahhh .  .  .  didn't really seem to be worth the effort .  it wasn't really very good ,  it wasn't really very bad ,  it was just mediocre .
-1	" three daring daughters "  is a sickly sweet ,  rose-colored look at divorce ,  remarriage ,  and single-parent living .  obviously ,  social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted ,  takes a cruise ,  and then dates and marries a band conductor .  even when the  " its just a movie "  phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems ,  'daughters' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs ,  children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself .  isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married ?    admittedly ,  this movie was released in the nineteen forties .  only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make 'daughters' a tolerable film .
-1	in an otherwise good review ,  loleralacartelort7890 says  " the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy .  it is not that well-known .  and the exact specifications are a secret .  and why is it a secret :  well ,  why should they reveal it back then ?  ?  if they where in a space race with the russians ,  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation .  "  this is completely incorrect .  there is  ( and was )  no  " secret "  to radiation protection in apollo .  the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available .  it uses a lightweight  " honeycomb "  of aluminum and stainless steel .  the entire outer surface  ( except the windows of course )  is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin ,  thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry .  these materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space  ( charged particles )  than lead ,  which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x-rays and gamma rays .   space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares .  but it simply wasn't a serious threat to the apollo astronauts .  the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief  ( 1/2 hour or so )  passage through the van allen belts .  they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received :  no more than 1 . 5 rem ,  and usually much less .  of the 24 men who flew to the moon  ( 12 of whom landed )  ,  18 are still alive .  only two have died from cancer :  alan shepard  ( leukemia )  and jack swigert  ( bone cancer )  .  the rest died from heart attacks ,  pancreatitis  ( roosa )  ,  and a motorcycle accident  ( conrad )  .  these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s  ( shepard would be 86 )  .
-1	ouch !  this one was a bit painful to sit through .  it has a cute and amusing premise ,  but it all goes to hell from there .  matthew modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying ,  and he does not disappoint in this one .  deborah kara unger and john neville turned in surprisingly decent performances .  alan bates and jennifer tilly ,  among others ,  played it way over the top .  i know that's the way the parts were written ,  and it's hard to blame actors ,  when the script and director have them do such schlock .  if you're going to have outrageous characters ,  that's ok ,  but you gotta have good material to make it work .  it didn't here .  run away screaming from this movie if at all possible .
-1	i am a 11th grader at my high school .  in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch .  so we did .  i am firm believer that we went to the moon ,  being that my father works for nasa .  even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched ,  the guy who created it has some serious balls .  first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot ?  and how dare he use all those biblical quotes .  the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates ,  which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates .  this movie did nothing to change my mind .  i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie .  michael moore next movie could be called  " a funny thing happened on spetember 11th "  or  " a funny thing happened on the way to the white house "  .
-1	this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min's there not the 90 min's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray .   seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
-1	i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings  ( 1969-1972 )  ,  or not old enough to appreciate them .  i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it .   i was a youngster at the time of apollo ,  but i was old enough to understand what was going on .  the entire world followed the moon landings .  our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch .  newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day ,  from launch to landing ,  from moonwalks to moon liftoff ,  all the way to splashdown ,  in a multitude of languages .  in school ,  some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv .  during apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate .  you couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was .  the world was truly one community .    now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact ,  it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down .  we are left with our history books ,  and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to  " prove "  it with a bunch of lies and made-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise--not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days .
-1	this so-called  " documentary "  tries to tell that usa faked the moon-landing .  year right .   all those who have actually studied the case knows different .   first of all :  there is definitely proof .  when the astronauts was on the moon ,  they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies .  these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs ,  who tested them .  and they all concluded that they came from the same planet ,  not earth :  because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth ,  but similar to those calculated to be on the moon .  i . e .  the conspiracy theorists never studies anything :  they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest .   another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing ,  i . e .  the flag moves .  there is a logical explanation :  the astronaut moved it with his hand ,  so it moved .  and what proves this :  well ,  if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage ,  they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be ,  i . e .  the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists ,  they cant study a subject properly ,  or only studies it until they have what they came for ,  so that they can make a lie from that ,  and make a profit  ( i . e .  this so-called  " documentary "  )  .   a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places ,  because there are different light-sources ,  the artificial lighting from the studio .  once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong  ( as usual )  ,  the same would happen in an earth desert at night ,  with no light-sources .  but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck-convention is held over .   the conspiracy theorists are in denial ,  big time .  they only see what they want to see .  so they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact .
-1	the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film .  it is a technically adept film .   that having been said ,  this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven .  most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program ,  rather than actual fact .  and sibrel's  " irrefutable proof "  that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics .   i do not recommend watching this ,  but if you do ,  see it at google video for free .  don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity .
-1	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 ( dir-brad sykes )  :  mindless 3-d movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle .  and yes ,  we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d !  !  wow ,  not !  !  that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating .  that's what made the original zombie classics good .  the flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra .  we're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame ( twilight-zone like )  easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's .  the last story is actually the story the movie started with ( having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town )  and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well .  well ,  i think i've said enough .  watch the classics ,  not this 3d bore-feast .
-1	when i was 16 i saw the documentary :   " a funny thing happened on the way to the moon "  .  i actually liked ,  and believed in it for a couple of years .  but then i grew up ,  and began to think ,  and when i had sought more information .  this is :  more info from reel sources ,  and non-biased sources .  when i started at university ,  not so long ago ,  i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories .  what he said shocked me :  he said that all those theories where lies .  that baffled me ,  i did not believe it first ,  but then he presented evidence for his claims .  he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject :   " humans did not go to the moon "  .  the most outrages claim was that the apollo-craft could not travel through the van-allen-radiation-belt ,  without the crew perishing from radiation .  the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy .  it is not that well-known .  and the exact specifications are a secret .  and why is it a secret :  well ,  why should they reveal it back then ?  ?  if they where in a space race with the russians ,  then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation .   and then there is the biggest evidence of all :  the moon stones .  when the apollo-missions did go to the moon ,  they brought back many rocks from the moon ,  to give to geologists and similar scientists ,  who are documenting all things about the moon .  these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon .  because :  the internal basic elements ,  which all matter consist of ,  are also made of special isotopes ,  that are different from quarry to quarry ,  land to land ,  and especially planet from planet .  the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved ,  that they do not come from earth .  the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram's of these rocks ,  all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth ,  and from the same planet .  ergo :  the moon-landings where not fake .  nasa did go to another planet :  the moon ,  though it is not a planet ,  but a satellite to a planet ,  a moon  ( duuh )  .  these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world .  it has been proved :  humans did go to the moon - it is a fact ,  pronto .   but i do not worry :  most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated ,  that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts .  the fact remains :  humans did walk on the moon .
-1	the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11 ,  and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day .   this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the  " whole earth "  picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window .   i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa ,  though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map ,  and the ones in private hands would still be a problem .   ah ,  a response :   " trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i'd say is a charming ,  but weak and gullible argument .  what about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie ?  a certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels .  do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here ?   : - )  this movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by u . s .  government that the moon-missions were a success ,  and that man now are true masters of the universe .  things are nearly never quite what they seem .  .  just watch the movie ,  and i dear say you'll see things a bit different than before .  "   first off ,  weather data doesn't come from nasa ,  it comes for met agencies around the world .  second ,  the weather data undermines a major claim in the film .  third ,  far from being  " packed with irrefutable evidence "  ,  the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked .  sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film ,  so he edited it and added his own interpretation .  unfortunately for him ,  his source film is public domain ,  and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims .
-1	there are so many incorrect statements in this so-called  " documentary "  that i found myself shouting at the television .   bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd ,  but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims .   he relies on either being inaccurate ,  not telling the full story ,  or the old favourite  " government always lies to us "  innuendos ,  and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims .   what's more ,  his  " exclusive "  or  " unreleased "  footage is freely available over the internet from various sites .   further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews ,  and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions .   all of the claims made by mr sibrel about  " inaccuracies "  ,   " mistakes "  ,  or  " whistleblowing "  in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven .   how do i get that 40-odd minutes of my life back ?
-1	i watched this video at a friend's house .  i'm glad i did not waste money buying this one .  the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one .  the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups ,  most not related to manned flight .  sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast .  he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say .  the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film .  his claims about radiation ,  shielding ,  star photography ,  and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa ,  the astronauts ,  or american in general .  his science is bad ,  and so is this video .
-1	the idea is nice .  bringing so many stars in one movie is great .  but .  .  .  .  too many stories ,  too short and lacking really any sense .  no connection between the scenes .  there were some 3-4 brilliant stories .  .  .  but these were out of 18 .  the frame reminded me of  " all the invisible children "  - a movie which i liked a lot .  compared to it ,  however ,   " paris je t'aime "  lacks the intriguing short story ,  which develops - starts and has its end .  and it lacks the topic connecting all those - children .  i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together . perhaps for people who know paris it is interesting .  otherwise ,  i wouldn't recommend it .  .  .
-1	writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa .  he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks .  the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time ,  and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film .   unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his  " backstage "  footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast  ( also on that reel )  that was seen by millions ,  not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies .  and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage ,  because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera ,  not faking footage .   finally ,  anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked-up version of it .   ( he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his  " smoking gun "  .  )  sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it .  what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use ,  such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth ,  destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth .   as with most films of this type ,  sibrel relies on innuendo ,  inexpert assumption ,  misleading commentary ,  and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .
-1	there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on  " drunken rampage "  by russian soldiers ,  which is completely untrue .  this movie should not be shown only because of this .   also there is a statement by someone ,  that kgb prosecuted  " jews ,  gypsies etc "  ,  which is  " worse than nazis "  .  kgb was looking for so called  " zionist "  agents ,  who were  ( kgb believed )  imperialist agents .  this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation ,  as nazis did .  gypsies were never prosecuted .  kgb was political tool and used politically ,  but from internationalist standpoint .  communists really did not distinguish between nationalities .   whole movie stinks like fake .  main hero does not speak russian ,  signs in berlin contains typographical errors ,  kgb general looks totally phony .  some so called  " russian proverbs "  are totally made up ,  and list goes on and on .   not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies ,  and phony stuff .  go to  " good shepherd "  instead .
-1	i was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that the scott brothers were involved .  unfortunately my hopes were dashed !  yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing .  at one point there is a laughable scene where 4 kgb agents couldn't handle one cia agent .  i grow weary of these biased ,  one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war .  i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww2 and beyond .  just like the pathetic u-571 ,  where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine ,  again ,  utterly false .   to its credit ,   " the company "  is very well filmed and acted .  the locales are also exceptionally well realised .  alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton  ( the conflict between them is very well done )  .  i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other 2 episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies ,  servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet .  it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10/10 .   s
-1	i do regret that i have bought this series .  i expected more action ,  more objective picture and more consistency .  this is just a pure propaganda series ,  very dark ,  without any charm ,  or romanticism ,  it is just boredom itself .  i find the actors work quite weak as well .  o'donnell might seem charming as robin  ( with batman )  ,  but in this picture he lacks any charm .  probably while he becomes older ,  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up .  it comes as no surprise ,  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands .
-1	proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold .  this is most definitely plastic ,  all the way .  its easy to see that without quentin's involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years ,  that's assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place .  it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes ,  angela jones is unconvincing in this role ,  william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment !  .  all in all pretty poor .
-1	thoughtless ,  ignorant ,  ill-conceived ,  career-killing  ( where is the talented angela jones now ?  )  ,  deeply unfunny garbage .  it's no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules ,  based on his own script ,  with the help of quentin tarantino himself ,  and creates something like this ,  anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world ,  doesn't deserve a second break .  under the circumstances ,  the performances are good - the actors do what they're told to do ,  and they do it well .  it's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place .    0 out of 4 .
-1	from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances ,  curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout .  the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino's name is attached to it ,  and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez/tarantino flick 'from dusk till dawn' .  these things do not make a great movie ,  however ,  and this is more than evident all the way through 'curdled' .  the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas ,  and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing .  the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool ,  but it's becomes annoying very quickly ;  especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican ,  it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie .  the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who ,  because of her obsession with grisly murders ,  takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes .  it sounds boring and it is .   william baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list ,  and even he doesn't make an impression .  he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing ,  he's pretty much wasted .  angela jones ,  or rather ;  the taxi driver from pulp fiction ,  takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman ,  and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role ,  not her acting ability .  she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino's masterpiece ,  but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself .  she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film ,  and if it weren't for her latino accent ;  she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level .  curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash .  films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics ;  but this one fails on all levels .  whether you're a tarantino fan ,  william baldwin fan ,  horror fan or just a movie buff ;  this is one to miss .
-1	excruciatingly slow-paced ,  over-scripted black comedy with a too-clever premise and bad acting .   maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode ,  but by the last half ,  you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already .

'crocodile shoes' and 'spender' were very funny ,  unfortunately i don't think they were supposed to be .  with 'auf wiedersehen pet' the opposite applies .
-1	be warned :  this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence .   the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways .   each story has only a few minutes ,  so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot .  just an sketchy idea of a plot .  the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer .  however ,  that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these  " jokes "  were just silly .   this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart .  a dozen times .  or even more ,  i don't know and i don't care .
-1	usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens .  .  . but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through .  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically .  corey haim's performance was abysmal as usual ,  nicole eggert was not much better .  this has no redeeming qualities ,  even if you are a number #1 fan of an actor/actress in this piece of trash - stay away !
-1	well ,  here we have yet another role reversal movie .  there were many worth watching ,  despite the tired plot of gender reversal .  however ,  this one is not .  in previous reviews ,  i think i've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for haim movies that followed the late 80s .  this is one of them .   'just one of the girls' is about a high school kid  ( corey haim )  who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school .  he joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader ,  marie  ( nicole eggert )  .  obviously ,  he can't keep up the charade for too much longer .   i thought this movie was utter crap ,  and it wasn't even funny .  but ,  judging by a majority of reviews ,  it looks like fans of alanis morrisette or teen sex queen ,  nicole eggert ,  are the only ones who'd want to watch this .  if you're looking for a good haim feature  ( or role switching comedy )  ,  look no further than 1989 .  this is about the point that haim's career tanked .
-1	i'd never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought i'd give it a shot .  unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed .  tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight .  not how i'd imagined tarzan would look .  and ,  unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea ,  tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell .  also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine .   oh well ,  so much for expectations .  anyway ,  jane was there - the monkey cheeta was there .  there was some guy with a guitar there .  there were villains and good guys and a romance .  .  .  all very harmless and predictable .  nothing bad ,  you understand ,  but equally nothing good .   probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan :  4/10
-1	last of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films and a good thing too ,  as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years .  no mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people ,  who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride .  she finds tarzan and jane ,  who try to protect her .  george zucco is present as a potentially villainous high priest but isn't used to his full advantage .  also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player/singer who goes into song every so often .  even the  " great "  robert florey can't aid this one .   *1/2  ( of four )
-1	the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller  ( looking surprisingly aged a year after  " tarzan and the huntress "  )  is bad ,  in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better .  it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller ,  shooting in beautiful scenery in méxico ,  with a top star of that country  ( andrea palma )  and multiple award-winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa ,  and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score .  although it may have cost less for filming abroad ,  it looks more expensive than any other rko film in the series ,  taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania ,  and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu  ( especially the exterior ,  built on steep rocks .  )  kurt neumann should have stayed as director ,  instead of robert florey ,  who gives it a very slow pace .  neumann had done a fine work with  " tarzan and the amazons "  ,   " tarzan and the leopard woman "  and  " tarzan and the huntress "  ,  and finished his career directing the classic  " the fly "  the year before his death ;  while florey became a television director ,  after a career of few remarkable films .  if weissmuller looks tired ,  the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others ,  but the worst character is benji ,  an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs  ( that have a caribbean air ,  in a location supposed to be africa and shot in méxico !  )  boring and decidedly of dubious taste ,  it was a sad farewell to weissmuller's tarzan .
-1	the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one .  there are a few things that derail this film .   first ,  tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals .  in my opinion ,  any footwear on tarzan ,  whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed ,  takes away from the character ,  which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle .   second ,  the character of benji ,  as mentioned in a previous post ,  totally derails the movie as the comic foil .  to me ,  his character is unnecessary to the film's plot .   also ,  while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan ,  it's apparent that he was not in his best shape .  although in his later jungle jim movies ,  his physique had improved somewhat from this film .   the octopus battle is a terrific idea ,  but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak .  likewise ,  the battle ,  which takes only 30 seconds tops ,  would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate .   and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye ,  it doesn't manage to salvage this last weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run .
-1	johnny weissmuller's final film as 'king of the jungle' ,  after 16 years in the role ,  tarzan and the mermaids ,  is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans .  at 44 ,  the ex-olympian ,  one of hollywood's most active 'party animals' ,  was long past the slim athleticism of his youth ,  and looked tired  ( although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry ,  tarzan and the huntress )  .   not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role ;  johnny sheffield ,  the quintessential 'boy' ,  had grown to manhood  ( he was a strapping 17-year old )  ,  so he was written out of the script ,  under the pretext of being 'away at school' .  brenda joyce ,  at 35 ,  was appearing in her fourth of five films as 'jane'  ( she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan ,  in 1949's tarzan's magic fountain )  and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever .   produced by sol lesser ,  at rko ,  on a minuscule budget ,  the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico .  while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa ,  veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively ,  incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story .   when a young island girl  ( tyrone power's future bride ,  linda christian )  is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan ,  he learns that a local high priest  ( george zucco ,  one of filmdom's most enduring villains )  had virtually enslaved the local population ,  threatening retribution from a living 'god' if they don't do his bidding .  the girl had been chosen to become the 'god's' bride ,  so she fled .  faster than you can say 'is this a dumb plot or what ? ' ,  the girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and returned to the island ,  and tarzan ,  followed by jane ,  colorful spanish character 'benjy'  ( charmingly played by john laurenz ,  who sings several tunes )  ,  and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest  ( poor cheeta is left behind )  .  after a series of discoveries  ( the 'god' is simply a con man in an aztec mask ,  working with the priest in milking the island's rich pearl beds )  ,  a bit of brawling action ,  and comic relief and songs by benjy ,  everything reaches the expected happy conclusion .   remarkably ,  tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer ,  dimitri tiomkin ,  and is far better than what you'd expect from this 'b' movie !    while the film would provide a less-than-auspicious end to weissmuller's time in tarzan's loincloth  ( he would immediately go on to play jungle jim ,  a more eloquent variation of the ape man ,  in khakis )  ,  the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been .   tarzan was about to get a make over ,  and become much sexier .  .  .
-1	this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen .  and that's saying a lot ,  considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise ,  lovers' lane ,  and bloody murder  ( which is a close second )  .  however ,  i love bad horror movies ,  and as you can tell from my username ,  this one really sticks out .  at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick .  as for this film ,  the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever ,  especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film .  the acting is nonexistent ,  and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex .  the policeman was the most stone-faced ,  monotone actor i've ever seen .  the best/worst part of this movie ,  however ,  has to be the murder weapon .  a giant safety pin ?  !  what were they thinking ?  who's the killer ?  a disgruntled  " huggies "  employee ?  i'd have to give this movie an overall zero ,  but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it
-1	want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work ?  just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman's club .  that's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end .  this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen ,  but every time i was ready to switch the channel ,  they'd add another scene with the workout girls and i'd stay put .  as a slasher film ,  killer workout fails in every category i can think of .  as a showcase for beautiful girls working out ,  it is a success .  strong recommendation to avoid ,  unless the thought of half the film being a big t&a show appeals to you .
-1	based upon the recommendation of a friend ,  my wife and i invited another couple to this film .  i really apologized to them--all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end .  half the vignettes are bizarre ,  with very little entertainment value .  there were few scenes of paris--for example ,  i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter ,  but i couldn't really recognize anything .  most of the scene was inside a bar .  no one in the theater laughed at anything ,  or reacted in any way .  if you like bizarre ,  pretentious ,  pseudo-intellectual films ,  don't miss this .  if you are down to earth like me ,  you will be sorry you saw it .
-1	you know jason ,  you know freddy ,  and you know leatherface .  now ,  get ready for :  the safety pin killer !  that's right ,  in killer workout ,  a dumb slasher movie if i've ever seen one ,  the unseen murderer dispatches his  ( or her ?  )  victims with an oversized ,  novelty safety pin .  it is an odd choice to be sure ,  the kind of thing that deserves an explanation .  naturally ,  the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing .   as the title suggests ,  an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect .  in fact ,  the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer ,  just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed .  and since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead ,  it's really just process of elimination .    oddly ,  while the entire name cast is killed off ,  the aerobics classes continue in earnest .  in fact ,  nothing is capable of stopping the dancing .  while three men are murdered in the next room ,  the workout goes on .  death isn't even a factor ;  one character dies ,  but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions .  director david prior knew what he was doing when named the movie killer workout and not logical workout .   cop chases ,  explosive tanning beds ,  and hundreds of shots of women's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure .  much like the woman caught in the tanning bed ,  i felt very uncomfortable by the end of killer workout .  finally ,  thankfully ,  the end flashed on the screen .  what happened next ?  you got it ,  shots of the women working out .  not even the end of the movie can stop them !
-1	one two three four five six seven eight and back ,  haha .  this is a must see ,  first of all to see the work out .  there are a lot of work out shown ,  see those close ups ,  man you will enjoy it .  a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie .  it's a slasher but without suspense .  the ending is funny too ,  and the clothes she's wearing in the wood confronting the copper ,  jesus ,  looks like a clown .  the killings are mostly done off screen ,  the blood flows but never too gory .  there are a lot of fight scene's too ,  and hey ,  no one got hurt .  and what about the weapon to kill ,  never seen a big one like that ,  won't spoil it ,  you must see it .  and being a slasher there's a lot of t&a too .  to guess who's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that's the best part ,  but what about the story of the copper in the woods ,  huh !  but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have .  i'm glad that i have my copy ,  one of those slasher failures .  but man ,  those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles !  if you are in your 40's then this is one is back to memory lane .
-1	big hair ,  big boobs ,  bad music and a giant safety pin .  .  .  .  .  .  . these are the words to best describe this terrible movie .  i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds .  . but this had got to be on of the worst ever made .  the plot is paper thin and ridiculous ,  the acting is an abomination ,  the script is completely laughable ( the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is-it's just so damn terribly written )  ,  the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures ,  the hair is big ,  lots of boobs bounce ,  men wear those cut tee-shirts that show off their stomachs ( sickening that men actually wore them !  !  )  and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again .  .  . in almost every scene there is trashy music ,  boobs and paramedics taking away bodies .  .  .  . and the gym still doesn't close for bereavement !  !  all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then .
-1	this is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized ,  but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises ,  taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits ?  prior to being a horror film ,   " aerobicide "  is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids ,  silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products .  if you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes ,  there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left .  plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin  ( yeah )  .  the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device .  several years later people turn up dead in the same spa .  you don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident ,  now do you ?  investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer  ( and charles napier look-alike !  )  and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty i've ever seen !  looking through the credits ,  her name's dianne copeland apparently ,  and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma-movie called  " surf nazis must die "  .  what a wasted opportunity !  she may not have been a great actress ,  but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business .  the amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special ,  neither .  we're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh .  the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable ,  but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore ,  anyway .   " aerobicide "   ( a . k . a .   " killer workout "  )  is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night ,  but nevertheless feel like watching a film !  it actually would make a terrific double-feature with  " death spa "  .  both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb .
-1	what can i say .  a kamal hassan movie being horrible .  he acts very well ,  but it is a horrible story ,  along with horrible direction .  in my kind opinion ,  the director gautham menon must give up directing .  there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie .  apart from that ,  one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes .  there was no practicality in the movie .  gautham is just running out of stories .  but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well .  the villains look too ugly ,  though their performance was not bad .  i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family .  you will not get sleep seeing this movie !  !  however ,  harris jayaraj again did a great job ,  and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10 .  his song 'partha modail nallae' is soulful and soothing .  apart from that ,  great cinematography .  on the whole ,  this is just a bad ,  bad movie .  kamal hassan ,  i think ,  should have rejected this movie .
-1	i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations ;  basically because of kamal hassan .  he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever .  but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better .    the protagonist ,  raghavan ,  is a very daring police officer .  who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders .  raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers ,  two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students ,  behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree .  finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives .   these two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters .  the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly ,  which the movie could have survived without .    to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty .  the director ,  gautham ,  should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience . certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham's name on the production list .
-1	on the way back from imc6  ( san jose ,  california )  ,  all five  ( mind you ,  three of us hardcore kamal fans )  of us had reached a unanimous verdict ;  vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday .  not to mention ,  we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year .   i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan  ( on vijay tv )  .  he said something like ,   " tamizh cinema'la photography ,  editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay ,  direction ,  acting'la innum namba munnera'la "   ( tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing ,  but we have hardly improved ,  when it comes to screenplay ,  direction and acting "  )  .  while you're watching vv ,  those words ring very true .   now ,  here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie :   1 .  harris jeyaraj  2 .  harris jeyaraj  3 .  harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here ,  but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his  ( remember 'anniyan' ,  'ghajini' )  with the jarring cacophony ,  he bills as background music .  the next time i have an eardrum transplant ,  he's paying for it .    4 .  songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice .  the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them .   5 .  a short gone too far .  vv at best is fit to be a short story ,  not a 2 hour plus  " thriller "  .  to use a cliché here ,  like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on ;  only in this case you don't want it to .  the later part of a movie feels like a big drag .   6 .  kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing .  there's no reason you would root for them to make it together .  in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie ,  they make a good irritant to the narration .  hate to say this ,  but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali' .   7 .  kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us ;  and it isn't new either .  he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae' .  it's simply gets on the nerve .  imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us .  he doesn't leave it at the immigration either ,  he offers doses of advice to his men  ( bewildered tn cops from keeranor ,  sathoor and beyond )  in chaste kamanglish  (  " wha we hav here is plain bad police wok "  )  ,  of course with nauseating effect .   8 .  logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale .  gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense .  which d . c . p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after !  the scene inside the theatre was so bad ,  towards the climax ;  we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq .   " is he stupid ,  can't he just use his siren or lights ?  "   ( on a busy madras road ,  kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude !  )  .   " can't he just use his gun ?  "   (  " the guy on a bike "  starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time )  .  i'm not voting in favour of the later ,  but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside .   9 .  gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped ,  their throats getting slashed ,  more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity ,  i would sit at home and rather watch a  " police report "  or  " kuttram "  .  the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story ,  not overwhelm it !  somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions  ( rapes ,  murders )  are and what the mainstay  ( story )  is !   10 .  even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head .
-1	filmatography :  excellent ,  nice camera angles  ( i don't remember seeing a movie of late ,  with good close-ups ,  until this one )  .  could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera .  ny is pictured good . i liked the upside down angles ,  in particular  ( a different touch )  .   music :  not impressive .  songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie .  may be ,  i expected same quality like  " anniyan "  .  a disappointment .    actors :  kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard-core action sequences .  his age and belly really show up .  also ,  he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward .  it was a very awkward to see a mature/aged star still trying to play like a 20+ heroes scenes .  love can be expressed at any age ;  as we get older ,  you still can express love nicely from a distance  ( without touching a woman too much .  for example ,  the love expressed by rajinikanth in  " chandrmukhi "  )  .   jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie .  not sure why she accepted this .  well ,  that is not my problem ,  i guess .   others just have a small presence .   direction :  i expected gautham to excel  ( or measure-up )  to his other movie  " kakka kakka "  .  he disappointmented me .  it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues .  he slips in few scenes .  even abvious things got slipped from a famous director .   overall :  just a okay movie .  too much graphics .  definitely not for kids  ( and adults who expect some kind of  " entertainment "  )  .   thx
-1	i pity people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood  !  comeon guys .  . this movie is a thriller without thrill .  .   come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs .   technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer ,  there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie .   kamal at his best is the best in tollywood
-1	it's  " the f . b . i .  "  starring reed hadley ,  with an all-star guest cast !  the film begins with an accidental  ( convenient ?  )  kidnapping ,  which leads to one thing ,  and another - which doesn't really indicate the main story ,  which is a  " big house ,  u . s . a .  "  prison break story .  the story is very improbable ,  to say the least .  it's like a tv show ,  only more  " violent "   ( for the times )  .   but - the cast is a trip !  picture this :  ralph meeker is sent to prison ;  his cell-mates are the following criminals :  broderick crawford ,  lon chaney jr .  ,  charles bronson  ( reading a  " muscle "  magazine !  )  ,  and william talman  ( reading a  " detective "  magazine !  )  .  honest !  you should know that ,  an early scene reveals what happens to the  " missing "  boy ,  answering the ending  " voiceover .  "  if you don't want to have that hanging ,  don't miss the opening scenes between the  " iceman "  and the boy  ( peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic )  .    *** big house ,  u . s . a .   ( 1955 )  howard w .  koch ~ broderick crawford ,  ralph meeker ,  reed hadley
-1	i am definitely a burt reynolds fan ,  but sorry ,  this one really stinks .  most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie .  i can't believe he even made this one .  is he actually that hard up for money ?
-1	i saw  " paris je t'aime "  because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him .  going in ,  i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production .  the  " stories "  are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful .  what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris ?  the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non-french feel .  the clichés about paris were endless .  yes ,  most of them were playing with clichés about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichés ,  they directly and regrettably promoted them once more .  yes ,  paris is the city of love .  we get it .   the worst segments were :  the one directed by wes craven  ( oscar wilde )  ;  the one with nick nolte ;  the mime one  ( the worst ?  )  ;  the hair products one ;  the one with juliette binoche  ( willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris ?  )  ;  the vampire one  ( when i think of paris i think of elijah wood )  .  the one with natalie portman ,  which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid  ( the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him )  .  on and on it went .  it felt endless .   i didn't like the coen bros one as well .  it really plays with those parisien clichés but i didn't find it funny .  just annoying .  the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight  ( and the punchline was obvious )  that it barely registered .   there were only two  " successful "  segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman .  nice irony there .  and the segment about the african who is stabbed .  it's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris .  the story could have taken place in any city around the world .   the last segment ,  the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad .  they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending .   the whole project felt forced and uninspired .  almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism .  all in all ,  with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff ,   " paris je t'aime "  was an awful cinematic experience .
-1	the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between . but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable .    but krista allen really rocked in the movie  . her voice was so seducing and sexy . the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do . krista really is one of the best in such roles . she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes , which is the interesting part of the movie .   burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star . he could have chosen a better script than this . ireally think he did for money .
-1	a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to  " the iranians .  "  low-rent video nonsense by the producers of  " silk stalkings "  offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged  " drama "  .  .  . a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects ,  although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie .  burt still has presence ,  although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked  " one-liners "  .
-1	about three minutes into this thing i started fast-forwarding ,  pausing only during the nudity  ( why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women ?  )  .  in ten minutes i was done ,  and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store .  the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa .  come on writers - the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control !  that's the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire !  also ,  to add insult to injury ,  the  " twist "  at the end was so formulaic ,  that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years .  burt reynolds was fine ,  but he should concentrate on real movies .   this movie is just a waste of time - run away !  run away !
-1	i am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me .  so i gave this a shot ,  after all it's the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian .  i have watched much less of lloyd's silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i'm a much bigger chaplin fan .  anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn't finish it .  i can understand why his sound career was so limited ,  he didn't get very good material to work with .  after you've seen chaplin ,  abbott and costello ,  the three stooges ,  martin and lewis ,  the marx brothers ,  and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs  ( or violence in general )  ,  this one is very forgettable .  i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me .  maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film  ( at least it seemed that way )  is before he gets in a ring .  i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time ,  4 out of 10 .  don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again ,  very flat .  for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend  " kelly the second "  made a few years earlier ,  another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase .  these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel .
-1	don't get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds , james woods and anne archer .  they are just glorified extra's .  their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so .  whatever their motives for being in this movie ,  if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him .  to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through .  the plot itself wasn't that bad .  and the acting from most of the actors was above average .  cuba gooding jr .  however was terrible .  he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes .  and since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing .  the action scenes were not bad , but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting .  again better direction was needed .  also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this .  it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action .  for an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow .  the only redeeming factor is angie harmon .  she does her best to make it all work .  too bad the director left her hanging .  yes , this movie could have been much better with a great director .  andy cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off .  and for an action/stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes .  don't waste your time with this one .  avoid !
-1	this movie had some great actors in it !  unfortunately they had forgotten how to act .  i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start .  it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time .  maybe it was the musical score or the director himself ,  but one thing is for sure the make-up artist needs to get another job  !  the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces  !  would not recommend this movie to anyone ,  no wonder it never hit the theaters .  cuba gooding jr .  / james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all .  the plot was great just needed a whole lot more .
-1	an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting ,  if only you could bring yourself to care .  this  " twisting and turning "  i speak of refers not to the story  ( which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole )  but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even remotely centered in the frame .  on the other hand ,  angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear .   the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it .  when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all-star cast ,  you might be inclined to think something stinks .   and indeed ,  it does .
-1	flat characters that you do not and never will care about .  cringe-inducing dialogue at places .  no twists  ( they think they have one ,  but if you didn't figure it out after about 40mins you're not too bright )  .  lots of well know actors in roles and performances that ,  fortunately for everyone involved ,  will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll .   i don't mind 'slow' movies ,  but they've got to be going _somewhere_ .  this one doesn't .   the plot wasn't what made this a direct-to-dvd movie ,  that's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy .   the as-of-writing 37 (  !  )  ten  ( 10 )  ratings must be from people involved with the production .
-1	mst 3000 should do this movie .  it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen .  first of all ,  you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash .  there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job .  also ,  the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot .  this movie sucked .  i cannot express the extremite that this movie was .  every single actor was terrible .  even the chick at the trailer park .  i crap on this garbage .  what a waste of time .
-1	it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance .  the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it .  the production was good ;  however ,  the script and acting were b-movie quality .  the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors .  the good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others .    this movie is not worthy of more words ,  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines .  james wood and cuba gooding ,  jr .  play caricatures of themselves in other movies .    if you are looking for mindless entertainment ,  i still wouldn't recommend this movie .
-1	this movie was like a bad indie with a-list talent .  the plot was silly ,  all the way to the end .  it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980's .  i would have given it a one ,  but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile .  i think the worst thing was the underwater scene's held off of the dock .  the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were ,  and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air ,  this air tank would kind of appear .  i would avoid this ,  unless there is nothing else on the shelf .  good day .
-1	only a handful of the segments are engaging here .  a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking .  one with fanny ardent & bob hoskins makes its point ,  twist by twist until the final shot overplays things .    the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris .  the others are so scatter-shot in theme ,  tone ,  volition & production that you may as well be watching  " the years best commercials ,  2006 .  "  it's really all over the place .  it doesn't develop over it's running time ,  and nothing reigns the directors in .  no construct successfully joins the pieces .  .  .  tedium sets in .  i'm at the one hour ,  twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb ,  over-commercial ,  overproduced vampire shtick .  it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic .  fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment  ( uh ,  thanks j & e for ruining another movie )  and then makes way too many appearances .  the point of being in paris is that you don't need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary .  why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director ?  has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film .  every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés .   making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless .  the transitions get lost .  this doesn't feel intentional ,  it feels sloppy .
-1	this ranks as one of the worst movies i've seen in years .  besides cuba and angie ,  the acting is actually embarrassing .  wasn't archer once a decent actress ?  what happened to her ?  the action is decent but completely implausible .  the make up is so bad it's worth mentioning .  i mean ,  who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film .  someone should tell the make up artist ,  and the dop that you're not supposed to actually see it .  the ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of  " and then they realized it was all a dream "   don't waste your time or your money .  you're better off just staring into space for 2 hours .
-1	you have to figure that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits ,  you are not in for a good time  ( the credit reads  " cuba gooding ,  j . r .  "  )  .  some nice car chase ,  shoot 'em up ,  blow 'em up action if all you want is action ,  because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best ,  and completely unbelievable .  the motivations of the characters ,  especially that of gooding's at the end ,  are worse then unbelievable ,  they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled .  all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project  ( he can't have something on all of them ,  can he ?  )  .
-1	camera work - why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy ?  this is annoying and distracting .  editing - the flashes of the still pictures were way too short .  many of the other scenes were too short also .  just flashes .  sound - the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices .  one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said .  doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again .  please reduce the volume of the background music in future .  is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor ,  julia wong ?  the plot had way too many loose ends .  the basic story line had potential .  i think the film needed more work .  was it rushed ?  perhaps they ran out of money .  like a lot of movies ,  it started out great but just petered out toward the end .  i really don't understand this ,  you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard .   sorry to be so critical .
-1	i rented end game ,  having never heard of it ,  but i'm fond of political thrillers so i thought i'd give it a shot .  after doing some research on the movie ,  i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release ,  but instead had gone strait to dvd .  after seeing it ,  i'm thinking ,   " no wonder .  "  the movie is shocking in its unoriginality .  the plot and the characters are perfunctory .  i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball .  i have to say ,  i didn't expect it to end quite the way it did ,  but that's not a point in its favor .  the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad .  perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist--even one that made the movie even worse .   stay away .  i want the $5 . 98 and my 107 minutes back .
-1	this movie looked good - good cast ,  evergreen topic and an explosive opening .  it went downhill from there .  why was it filmed by hand held camera ?  it shakes ,  judders ,  part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer .  a poor choice indeed .  as if this was not enough ,  the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all .  and then it commits the worst sin of all .  after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion ,  they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive ?  how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending ?  doh !  this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud .  what a waste of effort .  poor effort by writer and director .
-1	i didn't expect a movie as good as  " in the line of fire "  or an episode of  " 24 "  ,  but it looked like this movie was made for tv and did a mediocre job at best .  the  ( good )  cast couldn't disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle  ( they really try their best i think )  through their lines of bad script ,  giving their rather flat characters any extras .  when i watched the movie i got the feeling that i had seen most of this in other  ( better )  movies .  in it you had car chases ,  big shootouts ,  romance ,  plot twists etc .  etc ;  this movie has none .   ** spoiler** as soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to cuba's character ,  you know who's behind all this and all the hints you're being given  (  " you stand too close to the president ,  see it from my perspective .  .  "   )  sound silly .    if it were up to me  ( and maybe it's a good thing that it isn't )  i would rewrite the plot like this :   first lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to cuba all the time .
-1	spoilers ahead  this is one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple .  there is not one redeeming quality about this movie .  the first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat .  instead ,  you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization .  the lake was ridiculous ,  looked like an aquarium ,  and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed .  characters show their advanced teleportation powers ,  for example alex thomas who falls into the lake  ( drunk )  ,  and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position .  angie harmon put up a pitiful performance as kate ,  made worse by the space-time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader .  an example of this would be when she said ,   " flashlight !  "  in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half .  finally ,  the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that i have ever seen .  it was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists .  an example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on alex's car .  i would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie .  the ending was absolutely pathetic .  the writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say ,   " oh yeah !  "  instead ,  we're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line .  unfortunately ,  there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap .   i give this a  . 5 out of 10 ,  the  . 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .
-1	how unfortunate ,  to have so many of my  " a "  list ,  and good  " b "  list actors agree to do this movie ,  but they did ,  and that is what sucked me into watching it .  i had never heard of this movie ,  but there was cuba gooding jr .  right on the dvd cover ,  and james woods in the background how bad can it be ?  in a word very !  this movie starts o . k .  has some twists and turns ,  then just lays an egg .  the ending was so weak ,  it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending .  how ironic a for a movie titled  " the end game "  to have such a poor one .  these are the types of movies that can move  " a "  list actors to the  " b "  list in hurry .  i hope cuba gooding jr ,  and james woods don't make a habit of this .
-1	my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory .  however ,  of the 10 pages of reviews ,  only a handful are negative .  i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future .   i admit ,  i'm more inspired to write reviews when i don't like a movie than as to when i do ,  so my handful of reviews are all negative .  still ,  that doesn't mean i'm biased towards not enjoying a movie ,  but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy .   paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i've seen in years .  by using an  " intelligent "  concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories ,  the movie ends up the worst of all worlds .  it is art for arts sake ,  but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish .  giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment .  directors can't write ,  writers can't direct .   ( i'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated ,  but that is because he's an actor turn director {which rarely works ,  either} )  .   what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don't make any sense ,  are not completed in 5 minutes and in total ,  spoil paris to me .  why call it paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck ?  there are only a couple stories that are watchable ,  most notably the piece by alfonso cuarón ,  but everything else will fall into obscurity .  the coen brothers short is passable ,  but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar ?  it's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it .  as we all love paris ,  present company included ,  we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks .  in fact ,  i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes .  seriously .  seriously .   people ,  natalie portman is not a good actress .  she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours .  and maggie gyllenhaal ,  why ?  !  ?  are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies ?  i'm looking at you natalie portman  ( garden state ,  closer )  ,  elijah wood  ( sin city )  and catalina sandino moreno  ( maria full of grace )  .   one final comment on the acting :  i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again .  find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable .   writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right .  i'm thinking of ernst hemingway ,  raymond carver ,  f .  scott fitzgerald ,  and john cheever ,  just to name a few .  it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this .  the same can be said about short films .  it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history .   if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story ,  then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all .  the directors either didn't care or were lazy .  in either scenario ,  by the time you are reading this it means you rented it .  praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it .
-1	so i'm looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called 'end game' .  it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller .  well worth a look then .  or so i thought .   boy ,  was i wrong .   end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring .  now being something of a whodunnit ,  i can't really tear into it as i would like without 'ruining' it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity .  but questions such as 'why has he/she/they done this ? ' ,  and 'where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ? ' are all too abundant following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion .   as for the acting - you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor's realised that they've made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie ,  and this then shows in their performance ?  this is one of those .  accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed ,  irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison .   of course ,  this didn't make it to the cinema ,  and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room ;  it is appalling .
-1	some guy gets whacked .  right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him .  he's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer ,  but a reporter gets interested .  she goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked .  she walks in ,  and corners one bodyguard ,  but he doesn't feel like talking .  i can't figure out why .  it's not like anyone else is interested .  she's the only reporter there .  anyway ,  her editor discourages her from working on this lame story .  but hey ,  she does anyway .  she goes to see the killer's sister & mom .  a few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire .  then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital .  she finds him hungover on his boat ,  but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them  ( and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire )  .  the reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them .    in the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street ,  there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse ,  some car chases with wreckage & death ,  a fake suicide ,  etc .  etc .  lotsa stiffs ,  all kindsa carnage .    great stuff ,  but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is :  why in hell the original guy got whacked .  what's the motivation ?  of course ,  it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested .  through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story .  nobody else in the media cares .  not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies .  true ,  the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity .  his job was a little bit dull .  he was just the president .  yeah ,  the one who lives in the white house .  oh ,  and the bodyguard is a secret service agent .   is that the spoiler ?   it should be .  after all there are no tv cameras ,  no other print reporters ,  no bloggers .  .  .  just another one of those police blotter crimes .  .  .   so what's the spoiler ?   lemme think .  .  .   no !  wait !  the spoiler is that his wife did it !  yeah .  .  .  the first lady .  she was p---ed because the president was fooling around .  and she gets away with it .  she's really sharp ,  huh ?  but how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ?  why would anyone bother ?  after all ,  only one reporter is even interested .    i give this move a  " 1 "  .  it was so dumb i just had to keep watching .  and it only got dumber !  that's the real spoiler !  but even though i've told you ,  you've got to see it to believe it !
-1	this movie was craptacular .  i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies' biggest antagonist was ,  in fact ,  myself .  i played it beautifully throughout ;  promising myself i would walk away ,  but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto-magically transform into something engrossing along the way .  even in this state ,  i couldn't help but notice that cuba's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper .  his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards .  burt came on the screen as a general ,  that's right ,  a general  ( who wears too much makeup )  .  i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba's ,  except mine was real and i stubbed my toe .  recompense !  recompense my stubbed toe !
-1	predictable ,  hackneyed & poorly written .  foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit .  i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days  ( and will only get worse )  that one cannot pick and choose much any more .  early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since .  the movie lacked intrigue ,  giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder .  some of the discourse was ,  frankly ,  embarrassing !  it's hard to believe anyone would even consider ,  let alone commit to ,  the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe .
-1	please ,  help the economy - spend your money elsewhere !  the synopsis of the movie is :  the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her .  that's it .  undetected by anyone ,  except cuba and angie ,  she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about .  .  . and gets away completely free .   some specific points are particularly hilarious :  while standing in front of the president ,  cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet .  .  . which then enters the back of the president's head .   cuba and angie watch film from a news camera ,  and they see .  .  . a clue .  they go to great lengths to protect the film ,  believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film .   cuba speaks with a presidential staff member .  the psm comments that there was no conspiracy .  cuba claims there was more than one person involved .  the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi ,  the cia ,  and the nsa .  gosh ,  i wonder is the psm is involved .   ms archer ,  the first lady ,  is a craptacular artist .  cuba can't make out a painting ,  and she says ,   " you're too close .  .  . stand back .  .  . look from a different perspective ,  look from my perspective .  "  can anyone miss that clue ?
-1	end game started well ,  the least said about the end the better .  it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going ,  for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive ,  intelligent person ,  half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character ,  we are given no reason for this apart from ,  the next scene wouldn't make sense without it .  the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes ,  it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr .  is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering .   the end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever seen .  .  .  .  .  . and that's saying something ,  i've seen gigli .
-1	i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought ,  with all the good actors in it ,  would be worth watching .  i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened .  .  .  .  . i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else .  .  .  . i tried to figure it all out ,  but really had no clue .  thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it .  .  .  . right or wrong ,  it's better than not knowing anything !  !  who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away ?  how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her ?  at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth .  does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game 2 ?
-1	cuba gooding jr .  is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u . s .  president ,  i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for ,  and this film shows us why .  he teams up with a persistent news reporter  ( angie harmon )  to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death ,  and so on ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah .   even with a cast of james woods ,  cuba gooding jr ,  anne archer and angie harmon 'end game' fails to grab your attention ,  plain and simple ;  some of the action is good ,  the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - well it doesn't !  the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that ,  at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters .   4/10 it's boring ,  predictable and dull .
-1	i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies ,  but this one is a real stinker !  the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it .  the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching .  he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together .   angie harmon ,  playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president ,  truly butchered the role .  there was no chemistry with gooding ,  her demeanor was flat and wooden ,  and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd .  this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the  " b "  list .   and what was cuba gooding thinking ?  ?  ?  he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances ,  but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him .   poor james woods and burt reynolds .  poor poor poor poor poor .
-1	i argued with myself whether to rent this or not .  i'm always afraid of renting something i've never heard of  ( don't remember this being in theaters )  .  great cast .  .  . that's what tipped the scales .  30 minutes in ,  i almost stopped watching it .  the first few minutes are fun to watch ,  but unbelievable .  it only gets worse after that .  the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better .  or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable .  i give it a 3 .  .  .  . a 1 for the writing  ( only because there are words ) and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script .  oh my god this movie sucks .
-1	poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy ,  tired of the hollywood glamor treatment .  first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli ,  an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress .  and now it's europa 51 ,  another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment .   nor does the story do much for alexander knox ,  in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son .  at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli .   bergman is still attractive here ,  but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman .  she's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son ,  despite attempts by a kindly male friend .   " sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind ,  "  she tells her husband .  a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace ,  but it does give us a sense of where the story is going .   bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war rome ,  but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse .   the film's overall effect is that it's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman .  the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she's two-timing him .  the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness .  the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum .   ingrid suffers nobly through it all  ( over-compensating for the loss of her son )  but it's no use .  not one of her best flicks ,  to put it mildly .   trivia note :  if she wanted neo-realism with mental illness ,  she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak !  !  it would have done more for her career than europa 51 .   summing up :  another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman .
-1	maybe it's the dubbing ,  or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying ,  moaning or otherwise carrying on ,  but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought  ( and therefore annoying )  films i've ever seen .  the film starts out promisingly if familiarly ,  as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son  ( sandro franchina )  .  whilst mummy and daddy  ( bland alexander knox )  entertain their guests at a dinner party ,  the youngster tries to kill himself ,  setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy .  spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea  ( ettore giannini )  ,  she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband ,  who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles .  bergman plays the saint role to the hilt ,  echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc ,  and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect .  unfortunately ,  the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety ,  as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes .  by the final tear soaked scene ,  i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters .  a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st .  francis .
-1	i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival .  most of the audience ,  including my wife ,  enjoyed this comedy-drama ,  but i didn't .  it stars lucas haas  ( brick ,  alpha dog )  ,  molly parker  ( kissed ,  the five senses ,  hollywoodland )  and adam scott  ( first snow ,  art school confidential )  .  the director is matt bissonnette ,  who's married to molly parker .  all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends ,  the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third .  it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful .  the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama ,  and i thought it needed to be the other way around .
-1	i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page .  it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud .  . the only mystery here is how oscar® winner f .  murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script !
-1	.  .  . ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet ,  and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was .  and i couldn't have been more agree about it .  then after that i saw this film on dvd ,  i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv .  luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap .  i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy .  so i can't be judging on how the film was made ,  but anyway .  .  .  it still sucks .  as for those who liked this film ,  i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is .  i don't know what do you think about this film ?
-1	on the surface ,  this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation ,  that is how to become a true self by embracing the so-called 'dark' side of human nature .  thus ,  we have the darkling ,  a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company  ( that is ,  recognition )  of men ,  and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled ,  more or less successfully .    however ,  if we dig a little deeper ,  we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person :  - in the opening scene ,  the main character  ( male car mechanic fallen from grace ) is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter ,  when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl .  lesson #1 :  cars are persons embodied with immortal souls ,  and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery .  the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished .  - just after that ,  another character  ( rubin )  buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once-lost-now-found famous race-car and is warned by the salesman .  lesson #2 :  just like any other person ,  a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced .  in addition ,  there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk ,  but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin's own personal greed for more profit .  lesson #3 :  thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only ,  but always as an end in itself .  - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and ,  more importantly ,  rubin's car :  the main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance ,  but also by a thorough look inside the engine room .  lesson #4 :  a car is not just to be judged by its looks ,  it is what is inside that really counts .  there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind ,  as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector's car .  this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson #3 .    there are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car=person'-theme ,  and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them ,  but the point remains  ( and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say )  that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or ,  if you're a car devotee .
-1	first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges .  sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired .  however ,  it wasn't the preston sturges ,  it was preston sturges ,  jr .  the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson's short story  " the bottle imp "  .  a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell .  that's fine .  nobody said screenwriters had to be original .  the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen .  my biggest complaint comes with the ending .  the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person .  at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film ,  they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film .  this is a stupid convention .  the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end .  there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think .  you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end .  in fact ,  i think it's preferable .
-1	the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f .  murray abraham was in it .  spoilers :  about halfway through ,  f . murray gets zapped ,  because the darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously .  he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success .  he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins .  however ,  part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil .  otherwise he cannot  " pervert "  their natural goodness .  that's what the little guy said in his barry white voice ,  which i found both charming and amusing .  mostly amusing .  like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen  " dee plane ,  dee plane ,  bos ,  here eet come ,  dee plane !  "  all through the movie ,  dee dwarf  ( actually a robotronic cherub )  talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice ,  saying things like  " it's ok to be bad ,  you know you want it .  "   " now you've committed murder ,  you're really moving up in the world "  and other remarks that sound like commercials for  " being evil "  stores or something .  it really is hilarious in a sick way .   anyhow ,  aiden gillen is no f .  murray abraham ,  and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe  ( or knifed ?  )  .  f .  murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film .  he is a good actor .  aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face ,  and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp .  class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about .  the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical .  if this movie were a parody ,  the ending was perfect .  if it was not a parody ,  then it was creepy ;  but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver .  the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending .  it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending .
-1	yes ,  i sat through the whole thing ,  god knows why .   it was a long afternoon ,  i had nothing to do ,  it was bitterly cold outside ,  okay ,  those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones i have .   i gave the darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - i have seen worse films ,  but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom--poor script ,  poor acting ,  bad lighting ,  and cheesy special effects .   the storyline ,  which never completely makes sense ,  revolves around this simple little family ,  daddy ,  mommy ,  and little girl--that i assume the viewer is supposed to be  " identifying "  with ,  all three of them were tedious and annoying .  you just want the dark side to get every one of them .   daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars .  daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the  " mysterious "  orient .  rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as  " the darkling "  .    during the course of the film ,  the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things :  a shadow without a person ,  the inner darkness that exists in all of us ,  and the devil .  so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me ,  it doesn't really matter .   the darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being .  this ,  of course ,  leads to immense wealth ,  followed by disaster ,  for the human who hooks up with the darkling .   and for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long ,  tedious movie .
-1	the film is about sir christopher strong  ( mp--member of parliament--played by colin clive )  and his affair with the amelia earhart-like character played by katherine hepburn .  up until they met ,  he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn ,  he  " couldn't help himself "  and they fell in love .  you can tell ,  because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is .  frankly ,  this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch .  part of the problem is that in the pre-code days ,  films glamorizing adultery were very common .  plus ,  even if you accept this morally suspect subject ,  the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel .  .  . and a really bad one at that .  sticky and with difficult to like characters  ( after all ,  clive's wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm )  make this one a big waste of time .  about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume !  you've gotta see it to believe it--and she looks like one of the bugaloos  ( an obscure ,  but fitting reference )  .
-1	merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt ,  with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong ,  independent lady-flier who's never been in love .  intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn ,  playing an amelia earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man .  the director  ( dorothy arzner )  and the screenwriter  ( zoe akins ,  who adapted gilbert frankau's book )  were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view ,  but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts ?  billie burke plays the type of simpering ,  weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong ,  and hepburn's final scene is another bummer .  a curious artifact ,  but not a classic for kate-watchers .  ** from ****
-1	i have seen some bad movies  ( austin powers - the spy who shagged me ,  batman forever )  ,  but this film is so awful ,  so boring ,  that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest .  a pity .  boasting talent such as kenneth branagh ,  embeth davitz and robert duvall and a story by john grisham ,  what went wrong ?  branagh is a big-time lawyer who has a one-night fling with davitz .  her father  ( duvall )  is a psychopath who hanged her cat ,  etc ,  etc ,  so branagh has him sent to a nuthouse ,  and he promptly escapes .  somehow  ( i couldn't figure out how )  robert downey jr ,  daryl hannah ,  famke janssen and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary .  i wanted to like this ,  and ,  being a huge grisham fan ,  have read all about this movie and i  ( foolishly )  expected something interesting .  this is honestly the worst film i've seen to date and i wish i could have my money refunded .  * out of ***** .
-1	dialogue :  stilted ,  clichéd ;  acting :  hammy ,  clichéd ;  plot :  predictable ,  clichéd .   just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this  " b "  rubbish ?  plummer was well established decades before this movie was made ,  kinski had masterpieces like  " tess "  and  " cat people "  behind her .  .  .  must have been desperate .   the bad guys all have bad-guy accents - *bad* bad-guy accents !   ( plummer especially !  where *did* he learn to do  " german "  ?  )  and most of them have bad-guy sneers as well .  the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh .  the good guy survives ,  amongst other things :  * a 5 "  throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ;  * marines' machine-gun fire  ( i think someone referred to a  . 50 )  in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ;  * several fist-fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium-first into a door frame ;  * a fall ,  backwards ,  from what looks like the third floor ,  onto paving ,  without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience .  the script has exactly 3 clever lines ,  the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring .   ok it's not all bad .  plummer does bring a certain class to his part ,  and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick .  of course that doesn't say much ,  but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here .  he delivers his  " ve haff vays and meance "  type lines with some menace ,  but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain .   this movie is truly an awful waste of time .  the acting ,  such as it is ,  is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee's very obviously faked fight scenes ,  but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore 007 or a bruce lee film .  don't bother .
-1	but thomas ian griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has ,  granted this was made 5+ years ago .  some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action ,  but comedy .  and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow ?  plummer's character was so corny ,  he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon .  personally ,  if action flicks are going to show skin -- i'd have liked to have seen equal time between female/male ,  otherwise don't show any .
-1	it's die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to one cop ,  jack  ( crackerjack )  to stop this .   a b-action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action ,  a ridiculous plot  ( as always in these movies )  and three fine stars .  thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists .  if you don't like stupid b-action movies this is not for you .
-1	maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check !  isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  check !  tasty looking love interest  check !  assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents  check !  german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check !  corny one liners  check !   deary me ,  does this film take the wee wee or what ?  the clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is !   in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain  ( complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid )  we have all the usual action move cliché's ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off .   jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point .   in amidst this mess ,  there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and/or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects .   looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels ,  i have got to find these gems on dvd !  it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel ,  well goodness knows !  one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third instalment .   still ,  blind purchases of cheap dvd's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep trotting out material of this awful quality !  !
-1	wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad .  every time i thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong .  the story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off .  also ,  they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done .  for instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for .  the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl .  she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was .  the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me .  i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff ,  so that almost seemed depressing .  i thought that the characters wern't explained well enough .  you didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .
-1	where to start ?  this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  the editing is the worst ever ,  the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked .  most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects ,  with muddled talking in the background .  i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on .  .  .  . and what was i supposed to hear exactly ?  probably one of the worst scripts ever made .  i can't believe people actually put up some green for this film .  it makes me think i could take a crap in a box ,  send it to producers ,  and then have them finance a movie for me .   dolph ,  was a usual ,  dolph .  nothing else needs to be said .  the villains were bad ,  the protagonists were bad ,  and the movie was a stinker .  if you really want to know what not to do when either writing ,  directing or editing a movie ,  watch this !
-1	this movie had the potential to be really good ,  considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner the hidden .  and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles .  but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one .   dolph plays a butt-kicking monk  (  !  )  who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years .  he must battle the minion ,  who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell .  the minion ,  naturally ,  wants the key so it can let the antichrist out .  along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies .   if i'm making this sound entertaining ,  forget it .  the pacing is very awkward and sluggish ,  the acting subpar at best ,  and the fight scenes staged poorly .  dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career .   the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery ,  but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest .   too bad ,  i really wanted to like this .
-1	i can't think of much to say about this film .    this was an awful movie .  .  . i can't even tell you what made me decide to view it .  it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to begin .   the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd .  my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done .  by the end of the movie ,  i found myself feeling beyond relieved .    the editing was poor ,  the acting was sub-par ,  and the storyline was weak .  francoise robinson was cast as a native american ,  even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage .    if a movie is going to be this idiotic ,  it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least .  it wasn't .  it was just pathetic .
-1	dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti-christ is found by an archaeologist ,  of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body .   ( like fallen without the suspense )  of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable .  i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren ,  like steven seagal and jean-claude van damme ,  i try to watch his movies whenever they're on tv .  i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed .  this movie is utterly terrible .  with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena .  worst of all is lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest  (  !  )  all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen  ( which was good )  and end of days  ( which was bad but better than this )  overall this movie is the worst movie i've seen from dolph lundgren .  it literally has nothing to recommend it .  it's awful and it's the lowest point in lundgren's career .  and i saw cover-up ,  the last warrior and masters of the universe .   1/2* out of 4- ( awful )
-1	the minion is about .  .  .  well ,  a minion .  a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped .  he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another .  anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage .  dolph lundgren plays lukas ,  a member of a secret order of templars ,  who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion .  the movie begins a thousand years ago ,  in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion .  then flash forward to 1999 ,  where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york .  an archeologist is assigned to study/dig the place where the key was found .  needless to say ,  the minion is after the key ,  and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist .   the movie ,  is just that ,  a low budget b-movie flick .  the movie lacks energy ,  and just trods along .  you'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies  ( especially the terminator films )  .  the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome ,  in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is .  it  " skillfully "  becomes a one-man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one-on one .  and it's supposed to be around for a long time .  all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience .  the whole idea of a secret order of templars ,  a door to hell ,  and the key isn't well explained .  we are merely to accept that they just exist .  the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks .  dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else .   the verdict :  2 of 5 stars .
-1	this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever ,  i emphasize ,  ever made .  what´s worse ,  my old hero dolph is in it and he´s starring it .  jesus .  .  .  the story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt .  the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter .  the actors ,  except for dolph who kinda sucks also ,  perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director ,  who by the way must have been absent most ,  if not all ,  of the time .  this is §12 million spent in an unimaginable way ,  because by the look of the effects and scenery ,  the cost can´t be a cent above §1000 .
-1	come on ,  let's get real .  the knights of christ ,  ordo templi ,  or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century .  the story is so laughable that it's pathetic .  dolph lundgren just looked positively bored .  and besides ,  if you wanted to have a real-life templar ,  why not just use the knights of christ ,  who are still in existence in portugal .  at least they should have taken history into account .  the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces .  the acting was bad ,  the storyline appalling ,  the action horrible ,  and the props were okay .
-1	for two of the funniest comedians ,  the movie was awful .  fast forwarded it and never got any better !  waste of time and waste of money !  tina fey is such a great writer ,  i thought that she would be so great in the comedy .  the previews were so great ,  but they only showed the best parts of the movie .  my husband even thought that for a chick flick ,  it sucked .  what is up with that .  movie was very slow ans boring .  i will not recommend it to anyone at this time .  i would like my money back for this one !  boo from us here in arizona .  thanks but no thanks .  who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant .  i thought that it was going to be so funny ,  i have had my own children and i have helped others have children .  it could have been more along the lines of reality .
-1	a very weak movie ,  mainly because of a poor story ,  but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr .  ,  and irrational behaviour by many of the characters .  if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it's creativity or acting criteria ,  then you may like this movie .  personally i can't do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched .   i'm particularly annoyed when a main character ,  that is supposed to be an intelligent person ,  continually acts like a complete imbecile .  in this movie ,  if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations ,  there would be no movie .   the first highly unlikely act is when the main character ,  a successful attorney named magruder ,  played by kenneth branagh ,  is leaving a party and happens upon a girl ,  mallory doss played by embeth davidtz ,  who is screaming that her car has been stolen .  they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home .   she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things .  when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town ,  they notice that her car is in the driveway .  also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken .   things are very odd ,  she's weird  ( looking like a tramp ,  she undresses in front of him until she's completely naked  oh yeah !  )  .  also ,  the father's strange ,  the house is a wreck -- everything should have told magruder ,   " hey this is too weird for me ,  i'm out of here ! ' but not magruder ,  he sleeps with her and then ,  motivated by her story and sex ,  takes up the case of trying to have her father committed .  it all screams set-up !   then ,  being the top-flight attorney that he is ,  he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before ,   ( a fact that all of the women in the office notice )  .  is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year-old ?  magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming ,  with ample evidence ,  that the father is terrorising them ,  the police ignore him .  i could have believed begrudging assistance .  but no help at all -- not likely !   it's just too unlikely .
-1	what happened ?  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast ,  but somewhere the movie loses it .  actually ,  it never really got going .  there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant ,  then find out that she is after all ,  but that was it .  steve martin ,  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie ,  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie ,  other than to make it longer .  i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters ,  kate and angie ,  and maybe try not for a pure comedy ,  which unfortunately it was not ,  but maybe a drama with comedic elements .  i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot .
-1	near the closing stages of baby mama ,  one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess' ;  i really couldn't say it any better than that .  and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again ,  the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time .  a lacklustre cast ,  mundane script and vague ,  caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin ,  but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour .  consisting mainly of very routine ,  cliché jokes based around an odd couple  ( rich and poor )  trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world ,  the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic .   as a story on finding love ,  it's not that bad ,  but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent ,  characterisation is notably weak ,  resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles .  as characters themselves ,  both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces ,  but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness ;  so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times ,  the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles ;  we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting ,  but rather their dynamic .  unfortunately however ,  although this dynamic works best ,  or at least better than the individual personas ,  as mentioned above ,  it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula .   kate  ( tina fey )  is a successful business woman who has hired working class ,  dumb-blonde angie  ( amy poehler )  to be her unlikely surrogate ,  and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl  ( dax shepard )  ,  both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences .  yes ,  it's the typical odd-couple premise ,  and one that we have already seen in this year's what happens in vegas ,  yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters .  kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air .  in fact ,  the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man .  of the few times that i laughed during baby mama ,  most of those moments were because of this man ,  and the remainder usually fell to shepard .   it's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera ,  and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough .  yet ,  for a film about babies ,  multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping ,  this isn't necessarily a good thing .  baby mama is grade-a ,  hammy ,  plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar .  so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature ,  but i simply didn't care for the world they inhabited .  the dialogue ,  along with sets ,  costumes ,  and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy ;  these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way so why should i care ?  at the end of the day however ,  a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests ,  and the frequency of its laughs ;  baby mama has little going on in any of these departments .  of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair .  i'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings ,  but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored .  in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable ,  but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience ;  a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch ,  baby mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining .   - a review by jamie robert ward  ( http : //www . invocus . net )
-1	i give this a generous four out of ten stars ,  or dots or markers ,  or something .   there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie .  all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear  ( greg kinnear !  !  )  moved along agreeably enough .   otherwise ,  the usual trafficking in stereotypes ,  blazing speed ,  rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack ,  and  " soundtrack "  is generous .    anyway ,  the two really really funny scenes involved amy p .  she's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way .  she's a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball .   i hope they  ( amy p and tina fey )  just flat out admitted they did this for the money ,  because if by doing it ,  it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies ,  then i guess we can say ,  yeah ,  it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role ,  who's really there to help you be more human .   blah .  4 outta 10 like i said is generous .   but no more ,  girls ,  ok ?  oh ,  i almost forgot .  the mom from  " two and a half men "  is in this movie ,  and she's had some kind of plastic surgery ,  so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old ,  so every scene she's in ,  i'm like trying to rearrange her face ,  or put it together in my mind ,  or just answer the question ,   " no .  wait .  wait .  has she had plastic surgery ?  "  because as a viewer ,  you really don't want her to have had plastic surgery .
-1	come on tina fey you can do better then this .  as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end .  sure it was funny at times .  even laugh out loud funny .  but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie .  i don't recommend buying this .  at the most i recommend renting it but thats all .  baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for .   tina fey and amy poalher made a good team .  mean girls is one of my favorite movies .  tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this .  but this isn't there best .  baby mama had a great supporting cast .  dane cook ,  sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness .   another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world .  after the great knocked up and juno ,  baby mama looks very average when compared .  knocked up and juno are hilarious ,  heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face .  baby mama's ending was unfunny and dull .   baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be .  i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious .  expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have .  i give baby mama .  .  .  .  .   4/10
-1	i wouldn't say this totally sucked ,  but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house .  steve martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat .  he's just not funny .  he's another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie .  the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original .  amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately .  the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes .  the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant .  the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts ,  but it seems to simple simmer along ,  not really entertaining or creating laughs .
-1	i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless .  an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas ?  the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man .  they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or , duh ,  burn him .  quentin alias mr .  fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame ,  who is unhappy in marriage .  wow ,  love plot .  the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid .  the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film .  where is the mummy ?  really just a curse unleashed .  this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least . watch this movie if you need sleep ,  because you will dose off .
-1	an expedition led by hunky captain storm  ( mark dana )  travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition .  they meet beautiful mysterious simira  ( ziva rodann )  who joins them .  they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy .  .  . and only simira seems to know what's going on .   a real snoozer .  i caught this on late night tv when i was about 10 .  it put me to sleep !  seeing it again all these years later i can see why .  it's slow-moving ,  the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in  ( and this is only 66 minutes long !  )  ,  the acting ranges from bad  ( dana )  to real bad  ( george n .  neise )  and there's no violence or blood to be found .  this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics  ( involving a silly love triangle )  than horror .   this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good ,  everyone plays it straight ,  there's some good acting from diane brewster ,  it's short and the mummy attack scenes  ( all three of them )  aren't bad .  they're not scary just mildly creepy .  still ,  this movie is pretty bad .  a sure fire cure for insomnia .
-1	**spoilers*** slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population ,  who are at the time revolting against british rule ,  from finding out about it .   given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt .  storm ,  mark dana ,  together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs .  sylvia quentin ,  diane brewster ,  the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin ,  george n .  neise ,  make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb .  on the way there capt .  storm sylvia and his men run into this desert-like princess simira ,  ziva rodann .   simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life ,  she doesn't drink water or get tired ,  but also knows just what capt .  storm & co .  are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig ,  pharaoh's ra ha tet tomb ,  as possible .   at ra ha tet's burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his egyptin guide simira's brother numar ,  alvaro guillot , already opened his tomb before capt .  storm can get there to stop them .  quentin violated ra ha tet's body by having dr .  farrady ,  guy prescott ,  cut his bandages .  this action on robert's and dr .  farrady's part has numar faint dead in his tracks .  it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age ,  at the rate of 500 years per hour ,  to become himself a 3 , 000 year-old mummy .   the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive ,  like a vampire ,  of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with .  this blood-sucking adventure by numar ,  with him later losing his right arm ,  goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance ,  you in fact thought that he already found it ,  to ra ha tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide .   we learn at the end of the movie that numar ,  to absolutely no one's surprise ,  is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another ,  some 3 , 000 years later ,  person or life .  numar's sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet's sister ,  since him and numar are really one and the same person ,  but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti !  also not that hard to figure out .   with numar/ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths ,  due the the pharaoh's curse ,  now at an end capt .  storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern ,  this in 1902 ,  civilization .  the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found ,  and unearthed ,  only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway .
-1	the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb .  the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy .  one by one ,  the blood is drained from those involved in the dig .   to be as brief as possible ,  pharaoh's curse is quite the lackluster affair .  while the movie does present a few good ,  original ideas  ( blood sucking mummy's ,  soul transference ,  interesting make-up effects ,  the arm ripping scene ,  etc .  )  and a few atmospheric moments ,  the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding .  to make matters even worse ,  the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding .  i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies ,  but pharaoh's curse tests even my patients .  the cast helps very little .  with only one exception  ( ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character )  ,  the cast is as dull as the screenplay .  finally ,  i don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas ,  but it's a laughable ,  ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience .   despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse ,  i'm going to rate it a 4/10 .  not a good rating to be sure ,  but generous given all the problems i have with the movie .
-1	this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad .  .  .  hence ,  can i advice anyone to watch it ?  well ,  i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition  ( i still can't believe it won )  .  . and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&a section .  . but that was also anything but interesting .  .  what's it about ?  well the first half  ( the worth watching one )  presents three characters :  a hooker ,  a musician and some kind of official .  . the first two lie about their professions .  . but the third is the actual liar .  .  the second half  ( do something else .  . don't ruin a good evening )  includes some old breasts and heavy drinking .  .  but maybe you will see it completely different .  .  . the tiff jury did  ( were they drinking vodka  ?  )
-1	the first hour of the movie was boring as hell .  there is no suspense ,  no action ,  not even a plot .  the movie went no where .  i mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film .  overall ,  the movie wasn't good at all ,  and i don't recommend it .
-1	as much as i dislike saying 'me too' in response to other comments - it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90 .   having been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable .  just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible .   worse yet ,  in addition to no discernible plot  ( other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people ,  even very old women ,  drink lots of vodka )  a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of rolaids .   as for spoilers - well ,  the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i tried .   don't waste your time or money ,  and don't confuse this with good russian cinema .
-1	i agree with the previous comment ,  the beginning of the movie is quite good ,  and get's you wandering about what is to come .  .  .  .  .  .  .  which is nothing .  all open story lines remain open ;  two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture ,  save for 1 or 2 very short scenes .  i wander if ilya wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out .  .  .  .  as for the one remaining character ,  nothing is done with her either .  she just visits some god-awful place ,  and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore ,  but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread ,  drinking homemade vodka ,  and apparently flashing each other .  some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling ,  like the judges of the iffr ,  but for me it is just bad taste ,  bad camera-work ,  a lousy script and frightfully bad direction .  therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading :  1 !
-1	the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour .  it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good ,  funny story is to come .  well ,  i can tell you it will not come .  it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness .    in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that ,  according to him ,  the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience .  i was amazed to hear that .  am i living in the same world he lives in ?  ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all ,  but that doesn't make me feel like i am losing my identity .  what does khrzhanosvky think ,  that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch ?  am i shortsighted or is he ?   well my vote :  the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 ,  a decent 4 is my conclusion .
-1	the worst movie i have seen in quite a while .  interesting first half with some engaging ,  terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar .  the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock  ( read disgust )  without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else .   i wanted to walk out ,  but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect .  still ,  time is precious  ( as the director himself observed in his intro )  and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one .   saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie ,  especially the female lead .
-1	let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more  ( most !  ) open-minded movie-viewers .  .  . movies are my passion ,  and i am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place .  .  . i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there ,  and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-area .  .  . i love to rent strange stuff ,  and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place . he told me he thought i had to see this ,  and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky ( one of my favorites !  ) atmosphere ,  i rented it .   the vote i gave here is not really fair ,  because i did not think it was awful ,  i just did not know how to rate it otherwise .  a question mark would have been more appropriate .  .  .   this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach :  i actually felt physically ill !  am i the only one whose stomach literally turned ?  still i did not want to turn it off ,  or maybe i just couldn't because i was fascinated in a nasty way .  .  .   i do not ever wanna see this movie again .   not awful , a 1 as i said . just not my cup of tea ( or wodka for that matter )  .  .  .
-1	if the crew behind  " zombie chronicles "  ever read this ,  here's some advice guys :    1 .  in a  " twist ending " -type movie ,  it's not a good idea to insert close-ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits .  that tends to spoil the twists ,  y'know .  .  .  ?    2 .  i know you produced this on a shoestring and - to be fair - you worked miracles with your budget but please ,  hire people who can actually act .  or at least ,  walk ,  talk and gesture at the same time .  joe haggerty ,  i'm looking at you .  .  .   3 .  if you're going to set a part of your movie in the past ,  only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time .   4 .  twist endings are supposed to be a surprise .  sure ,  we don't want twists that make no sense ,  but signposting the  " reveal "  as soon as you introduce a character ?  that's not a great idea .   kudos to the guys for trying ,  but in all honesty ,  i'd rather they hadn't .  .  .   only for zombie completists .
-1	film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar .  ok .  they're talking about their imaginary lives ,  lying all the time ,  with no reason .  still ok . from time to time ,  they even make you laugh .  interesting .  first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it !  but then .  .  . things become worse .  .  . nothing's happening .  .  . for a long time .  .  . and then ,  when something happen ,  all you can see are naked old  " ladies "  touching each other !  not ok .  disgusting !  by the way ,  this part should be the top of the movie ,  but it's everything except that !  movie has no point , it's boring ,  and sick !    the strangest thing is that here ( belgrade ,  serbia )  on fest  ( film festival )  ,  this movie was the most popular according to researches ,  of course ,  before people watched it !  i even thought ( before watching )  :   " hay ,  this might be interesting ,  although it's a russian movie "  !  but ,  god ,  no !  !  !  !
-1	the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend .  there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken ,  but they are not fully explored .  the core of the movie is the funeral ,  wake ,  and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable .  apparently ,  the movie is unedited .  the prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud .  maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape .  the village itself ,  such as it is ,  is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male ,  the consort of the dead girl .  continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible .  most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea .  another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones .  don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in russian .
-1	the russian movie ,   " 4 ,  "  follows the lives of three  ( not four )  strangers who meet one night in a local bar .  one is a musician ,  one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl .    " 4 ,  "  i gather ,  is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia  ( the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are )  ,  but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it .  there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities ,  selling decades-old frozen meat etc .  - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here .   despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes ,   " 4 "  is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .
-1	i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie !  the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot ,  and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending .  but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on .  it's just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh's character around by his nose .  the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer ,  which has been left out in the sun too long .  the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie .  don't waste your time here !
-1	i'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy ,  all right :  one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film ,  despite its obscurity ,  will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a  " universal acclaim "  or something within that range ,  thus ensuring unsuspecting folk  ( like me )  will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing ,  expecting a surprise ,  only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck .   this movie is one of them .  it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened :  either i didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner realms as to be impossible to access ,  or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name .  4 is a dirty trick on the audience .  it's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say  " smorsgabord "  and that despite the rating it got on metacritic ,  no one had heard of it .  it's terrible with sugar on top .   firstly ,  there is the ever-present number four from start to finish .  while having a little symbolism here and there is okay ,  and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well-known movies ,  this movie is panting with it .  four dogs at the start of the movie ,  looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly ,  machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt .  four people in a bar ,  although one of them is a non-entity .  three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless ,  not only to each other but to what their lives are not .  while this concept may work ,  the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would-be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre ,  and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation .  or maybe ,  like i said before ,  i just  " didn't get it .  "  the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina's story  ( which revolves on the death of her sister ,  from bread-chewing ,  no less ,  and the subsequent ,  shrill mourning which follows )  that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace .  so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own ?  the director doesn't invest much time in truly tying them together ,  or weaving a tighter story that could ,  in a david lynchian way ,  intersect either with the past-present ,  or within alternate dimensions ,  or even as a straightforward ,  mundane science-fiction story .  this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint  ( or someone into the weird for weird's sake )  could endure .
-1	i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie .  i guess i must have missed something .  the beginning is intriguing ,  the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories .  that's the best part .  after the three go their separate ways ,  the film splits into three threads .  that's when boredom sets in .  certainly ,  the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity .  unfortunately ,  the director beat this one to death ,  even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular .  bottom line :  a two-hour plot-thin listlessness .  if you suffer from insomnia ,  view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .
-1	perhaps being a former moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the 'arthouse/festival crap' trashcan .  it's not the greatest film of 2005 ,  nor is it complete garbage .  it just has a lot of problems .  i also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any 'ideological fears' ,  or 'conservative taboos' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called 'courageous' and 'uncompromising' abroad .  it was banned because the censors knew 99% of the russian film-goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film .   so we have a strong opening shot .  wonderful sound design ,  excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism .  the usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film's strongest aspects  ( not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge )  .  over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup .  an amusing and well-written bar conversation among the 3  ( main ?  )  characters ,  and we feel pathos for these people ,  the great country of russia ,  the human condition and all that .  then the movie starts slowing down .  we begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead .   the rest is quite boring ,  simply put .  sure ,  the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings ,  and there are some slightly amusing moments .  nice sound ,  sure .  but the enjoyment of this movie ,  not to mention the plot ,  are seriously compromised by the pacing problems .  and this ,  this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the  ( nicely-shot )  abject misery and bleakness ,  is what ultimately will make people angry at the 'offensive' stuff  ( personally ,  the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing ,  in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear )  .   if you want to watch an enjoyable movie where russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time  ( the entire film )  ,  watch particulars of the national hunt .  much more rewarding post-soviet stuff .  so yeah ,  a 4 out of 10 for 4 ,  nice and symbolic of my post-mediocre-film condition .
-1	the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene ,  three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar .  all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories .  as the movie unfolds ,  it turns out that the most outrageous story is true .  however ,  beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed .  this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly ,  not much is left to be seen .  the rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies .  sure ,  these are fascinating and a bit shocking images ,  but admiring them goes on way too long ,  sacrificing any possible plot or character development .  i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie-making ,  where instead of trying to make an interesting story ,  movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories  ( case in point - meat trader's story )  to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends .  on a surface it has artsy appearance ,  but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent .
-1	i saw the film at the belgrade film festival last week ,  and i'm still working off the trauma .  essentially my view seems to match a number of others - the first half hour was fresh ,  sharp ,  deep ,  entertaining and promising .  well acted too .  natural .  my problem ,  however ,  is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning ,  nor the fact that i spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp ,  grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken ,  toothless ,  bread-chewing hags .  it's rather with the fact that they never warned me !  !  !  the festival brochure synopsis described only the  ( utterly intriguing-sounding )  first half hour - a whore ,  piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar ,  pretending to be an advertising agent ,  genetic engineer ,  and petty government administration official ,  respectively - making no mention whatsoever of the never-ending gum-smacking to come .  serves me right for not reading the reviews ,  you might say - but to my defense ,  a number of reviews i looked at post-fact um didn't at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film .   the first hint should have been the introductory words by the director  ( a bashful ,  tousle-haired russian youth )  who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium  ( the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically ,  and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening ,  though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come ,  judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour ,  and many exasperated comments on exit )  to say the following :  'well ,  i .  .  .  um ,  thank you very much for coming to see this film ,  and i just wanted to say .  .  .  well ,  it's a very long film .  .  .  it took me four years to make it ,  and .  .  .  it's .  .  i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it .  it is very long .  thank you for coming . ' this is what he said .  alarm bells should have been ringing .  'what's he talking about ? ' i thought in happy confusion .  'this is gonna be fun ! ' of course ,  by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me ,  it was far too late to get out .  all i could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again .  and in the end i can't say i feel in any way improved by the experience .  yes ,  i absolutely loved the first half hour .  it was intelligent ,  new ,  and had a lot to say .  and yes ,  russia is probably in a bad state .  yes ,  every society has many hidden faces .  yes ,  toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard .  yes yes yes .  i get all of this .  really i do .  but i see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out ,  and so painful to bear .  if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging ,  try the korean-chinese bin jip  ( 3-iron )  .  it's artsy and surprising ,  but also to-the-point and fun .
-1	this was a blind buy used dvd .  it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit play .   it's bubble-headed comedy ,  but it's um .  squalid .  the plot is zany !  ,  but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watch .   maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven ,  goofy caper film .   ( i know ,  i know ,  the quotes on the box & the academy award nomination mean nothing .  )
-1	'iedereen beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video-movie .  it's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star .  the only thing he needs is to get her on stage ,  surrounded by cameras and reporters .  a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail .  the problem with the movie is not the basic plot ,  but how it is made .  everything is supposed to be funny ,  but it isn't .  it is trivial and clumsy ,  the characters are shallow ,  and the end-sequence is totally without climax or emotion .  the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing ,  but only at how pathetic the whole set-up is .
-1	this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise ;  but ,  in my view ,  begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down .  that this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough ,  but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories .   i found this movie average at best .  art direction could have been much better ,  as could have been cinematography .  the acting was good ,  and so was eva van der gucht's singing .
-1	mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind-the-scenes story that's more interesting than the movie itself .  this was chaplin's tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship ,  and his first two-reeler .  here he played one of his last out-and-out villain roles  ( although the feature-length tillie's punctured romance was yet to come )  ,  and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself .  in fact ,  chaplin's conflicts with director and co-star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio .   chaplin hadn't gotten along with his earlier directors ,  henry lehrman and george nichols ,  but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere  " girl "  was the last straw .  charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film .  chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn't know what to make of him ,  but everyone loved mabel .  producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer's films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a . s . a . p .  ,  so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it .   unfortunately ,  none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel ,  which looks like typical keystone chaos .  the story concerns an auto race in which mabel's beau  ( harry mccoy )  is scheduled to compete ,  but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad ,  and mabel must take the wheel in his place .  for all the racing around ,  brick hurling and finger-biting the film is frankly short on laughs ,  but there are a few points of interest .  there's some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence ,  though there aren't really any gags ,  just lots of frantic activity .  chaplin himself looks odd ,  sporting a goat-like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance ,  making a living ,  but the outfit suits the old-fashioned villainy he displays throughout .  at least it's novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role .  visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin ,  edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get-up ,  and a more characteristic mack sennett ,  spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine .  as a performer ,  sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced ,  but you have to give the guy credit :  he knew what people liked .  these films were hugely popular in their day .  mack's performance doesn't add much to mabel at the wheel ,  but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn't kill each other .
-1	i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago . what a disaster  . the acting was atrocious . there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon . this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring true . supposedly a modern reworking of the hitchcock original  " lifeboat "  . i think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it . from what i was able to suffer through , there is nothing compelling in this movie . it boasts a few semi big names , but they put no effort into their characters . but , you know , to be fair , it was nobody's fault really . i mean , i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion .  lol . it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along . but for me , i'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out . so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon , avoid this stinker/ 1/10
-1	this film is really bad ,  with a script full of 'memorable' lines and incredibly bad performances .  the special effects are also bad  ( not the worst ones i have seen ,  either )  and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it .  just two short themes  ( 30 seconds long or so )  are repeated constantly throughout the whole film .   all in all ,  one of the worst films i have ever seen .
-1	in the first one it was mainly giant rats ,  but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too .  this one ,  however ,  is just giant rats period ,  well giant rats and one really growing little boy .  this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats .  .  . you know how it is .  this movie has some kills and its moments ,  but i find it to be on par with the original ,  i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies .  well ,  that is not true .  .  . i actually like  " empire of the ants "  ,  maybe i just do not care for giant rodents .  all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre .  i just can't recommend this one .
-1	i should never have started this film ,  and stopped watching after 3/4's .  i missed the really botched ending .  this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better .  it had nice atmosphere ,  a top notch cast and director ,  good locations .  but a baaaaaad story line ,  a bad script .  i paid attention to kenneth branagh's southern accent--it was better than the script .  the plot was stupid--driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways .  no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts .
-1	boring ,  predictable ,  by-the-numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of  ( mindless )  mayhem and gore to satisfy  ( mindless )  genre fans .  mostly it's about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don't care an iota about - if that's your thing ,  tune in .   ( *1/2 )
-1	who could possibly have wished for a sequel to bert i .  gordon's legendary bad trash-film  " food of the gods "  ?  nobody ,  of course ,  but director damien lee thought it was a good idea ,  anyway ,  and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history .   " gnaw "  is a sequel in name only ,  as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location  ( a university campus )  and also the cheap & cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's .  this script hangs together by clichés ,  awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other  ( and more successful )  horror classics .  neil hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing-experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor .  due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists ,  the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus .  following the good old tradition that spielberg's  " jaws "  started ,  there's an obnoxious dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere .  during a hysterically grotesque climax ,  the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus' new sport complex !   " gnaw :  food of the gods 2 "  is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch !  the characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff  ( like descending into the sewers unarmed while they know it's infested with rats )  ,  the acting is atrocious and there's a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth-serum !  i wonder what freud's theory would be on that !  there's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and  it has to be said  the music is surprisingly atmospheric .  in case you just can't get enough of this junk ,  there are quite a lot of creature-features revolving on mutated rats ,  like the italian schlock film  " rats :  night of terror "  ,  the modest 70's cult film  " willard "  and its lame sequel  " ben "  ,  the 2003  " willard "  remake starring crispin glover and the surprisingly good recent rat-movies by once-famous directors tibor ticaks  (  " rats "  )  and john lafia  (  " the rats "  )  .  go nuts !
-1	camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot .  this time they've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness .   this time around there's a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants .  this is hardly a new idea ,  i've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife .   unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs .  i liked how there's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom .   i don't know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film ,  i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one .  the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me ,  it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $5 just like they did in the second movie .  they still haven't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well ,  it's a camp blood movie what do you expect ?  if you like crap films you'll get some fun out of this one .
-1	nothing to say but wow !  has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field ?  well this happens about 25 times in this movie ( clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic )  .  in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film .  shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and ,  although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute .  after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims .  if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest .  .  her ribs go all the way to her neck ,  it was flat out disgusting .  most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day .  the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard .  the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically .   definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field .   signed ,  the answer
-1	this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen .  here are the things that immediately jump out at me :  1 .  the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush .  not scary whatsoever .  news flash ,  if you are filming in the southern california area ,  big bear is only an hour away .  they actually have trees there .   2 .  the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced .  every possible line in the movie was unoriginal ,  cliché ,  or just plain stupid .  for instance the name of the camp is  " camp blood "   ( lame )  ,  the name of the clown is  " the killer clown "   ( lame )  .  what is a clown doing in a forest anyway ?  was that the only mask they could find ?  3 .  the last but certainly the least was the acting .  absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled .  a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting .  worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph .  it's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy ,  but she was not .  also ,  and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me ,  was this tool who is supposed to be  " athletic .  "  for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them .  then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very  " girl like "  run ,  that he is quite far from athletic .  oh and to the girl who played kat ,  good lord stop singing .  that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself .   if for some reason you do see this movie ,  i would at least recommend watching the special features .  the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story .  in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending .  apparently she hangs out with special kids .
-1	after some internet surfing ,  i found the  " homefront "  series on dvd at ioffer . com .  before anyone gets excited ,  the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago .  the resolution and quality are poor .  the images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look .  although the commercials were edited out ,  the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the abc news program  " nightline "  ,  complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's .  even with the poor image quality ,  the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine .   to this show's credit ,  the casting was nearly perfect .  everyone was believable and really looked the part .  their acting was also above average .  the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler  ( most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong )  .  the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets ,  especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor .  the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time .  for example ,  conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes .  the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations .  that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case .   as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago .  despite all the ingredients for a fine show ,  the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start .  for one thing ,  the name of the show itself is totally misleading .  when wwii ended in 1945 ,  there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a  " homefront "  either .  curiously ,  the first episode of the show  " homefront "  begins in 1945 after the war had ended .  that's like shooting the first episode of  " gilligan's island "  showing the castaways being rescued .  the whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost .  i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no ,  the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 .  additionally ,  this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's .  by the third episode ,  it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda .  the show is set in river run ohio ,  near toledo .  however ,  the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio .  part of the ensemble cast are dick williams ,  hattie winston and sterling macer jr .  who portray the davis family .  much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil  " whites "  to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable .  the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years .  we get it .  we're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis .  the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show ,  as it was for  " homefront "  .  the acting talents of williams ,  winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical  " frightened / angry black family "  .  the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something .  the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing ,  and leave it at that .  devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid .   in yet another ridiculous plot line ,  the big boss of a local factory  ( ken jenkins )  is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees .  the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer .   personally ,  i think this series had great potential .  the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories .  of course the loss of brothers ,  sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama .  the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to europe or the pacific .  the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless .  but no ,  the writers of homefront  ( david assael and james grissom )  completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots .  instead ,  they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics .  it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage .
-1	why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance ?  i want a refund .  .  .  can i have my $16 back ?  while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen ,  nothing did happen .  the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot ,  which was not really like the film .  why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out ?  it was not very artistic .  why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes ?  why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading ?  or was that the point ?  i felt like phantom love had no story at all ,  and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film .
-1	the only thing remarkable about this movie ?  is that all the actors could bomb at the same time .  idiocy .  i want my money back .  .  . and i got it free from the library .  sheesh .  i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again .
-1	this film was so disappointing .  from the blurb that made me decide to see phantom love  ( why is it called this ?  ) i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery .  it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense .  in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time .  in the end the effect was listless .   i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric ,  but it just wasn't .  the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters .  you might say it was mysterious ,  but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere .   the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation .  without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child .  the film has very little context for the time ,  place or character .  i am not a prude but the sex scenes  ( there were several )  seemed pointless and confused me further ,  i recognised lulu but i was not sure if it was the same man ,  different men ,  a lover ,  her husband or was she a prostitute .  it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover .  this film did manage to make what should have been shocking  ( dream sequences involving lulu's mother )  seem a bit boring .   the nail filing actually made more sense ,  as it did give some indication of lulu's emotional state .  i will not fault the actors as i don't they had a lot to work on .   i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull .   i can't be bothered talking about it anymore .
-1	del -  " you are the dumbest smart person i've ever met .  "   calvin-  " well , i had a brain ,  but they lost it in the re-writes .  "   i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov's work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed .  in the books ,  she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists ,  able to think her way through a problem .  here she's just a damsel in distress ,  waiting to be rescued by wil smith .   there are passing references to asimov's laws of robotics ,  but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes .   smith is likable ,  as he is in most of his films ,  but honestly ,  the story isn't that good .  you figure it out long before these genius characters do .
-1	waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand ,  i expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology ,  instead i went disappointed by each aspect of it ,  once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot ,  which by my opinion was the worse in this year .  acting in this movie also dissatisfied me ,  will smith didn't show anything new in this movie ,  yet i never saw his acting to change since  " men in black "  which was his only success by my opinion .  he had to retire since than ,  not spoiling his name with titles like  " i , robot "  and  " men in black 2 "  .  4/10
-1	i can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction .  forget the product placement disaster ,  the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot-holes .  this wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch .  even the action was boring .  a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children .   what a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had bladerunner ,  minority report or to a lesser extent dark city  ( by the same director )  .  this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list .  truly awful .
-1	after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers .  there are the ones who are well read ,  extremely literate ,  and intelligent .  they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author .  for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature .  considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers .  today's well read fan knows well this history ,  and knows the great authors asimov ,  heinlein ,  bradbury ,  and ellison ,  who helped bring science fiction out of that basement .  in doing so they created thought provoking ,  intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition .  this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them .  they are not critical for it's own sake ,  but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye .   ( as they should as hollywood's record has been less than stellar .  )  to these fans the story must take supreme importance .  they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics ,  and non stop action sequences .  when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest .   the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre .   ( look at many of the above comments that state  " well i haven't read the book or anything by this author .  .  .  )  their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel .  they are extremely uncritical ,  willing to overlook huge plot holes ,  weak premises ,  and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects .  they are ,  in effect ,  willing to turn off their critical thinking skills  ( or maybe they never had them !  )  for the duration of the movie .  case in point ,  i robot .  while supposedly based on asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels ,  it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations .   ( those of you that will run out and buy i ,  robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all !  )    the film has enormous plot holes ,  that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity .  i won't point them out .  i won't spoon feed you .  you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself .  the characters ,  which are named after many of asimov's characters ,  do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories .  the plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for .  his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds ,  not their fists ,  is vital to understanding his vision of the future .  in short ,  other than the name ,  their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie .  there will always be those uncritical  ( i . e .  unthinking )  who will state :   " the movie doesn't have to be like the book .  due to the medium ,  movies sometimes require that changes be made .  "  but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book  ( or books )  from the start ?  what if all they took from the written work was the title ?  this begs the question :  why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap ?  save money and don't buy the rights to the works .  title it something else .  don't use the character's names .  believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism .  in fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him .  but it will upset those who read ,  who think ,  who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show .    i ,  robot ,  like much of hollywood's take on the genre ,  pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago .  hollywood could not do this alone .  it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this .
-1	i just saw this film on dvd last night ,  and decided to check out the reviews this morning .  it seems that  " i ,  robot "  has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb  ( and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling ,  too )  .   i find this somewhat surprising ,  as this film is not great  ( or even good )  ,  but neither is it terrible  ( or even really bad )  .  what this film really is ,  is .  .  . depressing .  depressing that the us film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid ,  clichéd re-heats ,  and acclaim them as spectacular new works .  this film as  " retread "  written all over it ,  from the plot line  ( an uneasy mix of asimov and modern-day uber-action )  to smith's character  ( a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium )  ,  to the special effects  ( that borrowed from matrix and a few others )  .    " i ,  robot "  is ,  sadly ,  quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience :  superficial plot ,  insipidly snappy dialog ,  and lots and lots of adrenaline .  smith is mediocre ,  but we already knew that  ( he seems to be hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis )  .  the story has lots of holes in it ,  of all sizes ,  but i don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice .  perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards ,  but very b-movie compared to true winners .
-1	this is probably the most boring ,  worse and useless film i have seen last year .  the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix ,  with plenty of clichés :  the lone wolf cop ,  good looking ,  psychologically disturbed ,  sleeping with his gun .  .  .  + nice hard worker and shy ,  but good looking she-scientist ,  you add a 2 cent plot and you have i ,  robot !  i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like fedex , audi , converse etc .  this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec .  i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy ,  if you have some spare time ,  watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book .
-1	in spite of the great future-design touches ,  the clever asimov premise ,  and will smith's dependable cool performance ,  this movie doesn't live up to expectations .  the clichés come thick and fast ;   ( waking from a recurring nightmare ,  maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant ,  to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off )  .  this movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere ;  what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago .  the robots themselves are good in closeup ,  but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad disney -the cgi is overdone again and again .  and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them ,  why do they need to inject 'nanites' ?  you know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax .  it could have been great ,  but it's less than the sum of its parts ,  mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years .
-1	this  " film "  is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film .  unnecessary slow motion ,  unnecessary flipping/jumping/somersaults ,  unnecessary characters ,  unnecessary dialogue .  .  .  .  basically unnecessity .   ( is that a word ?  well ,  it's just been invented by i ,  robot .  )   what happened to practicality ?   ( i . e .  the car garage ,  the skin spray )  the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop .   what happened to showing respect for women ?   ( i . e .  smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film ,  and yet she still  " wants "  him .  where is the tension ?  i'll tell you where ,  good looks and not admiration or common ground )   what happened to a detective that detects ?  smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself ,  complaining to other people ,  and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off .  this is such a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc .  .  .  it was ok once ,  but not several times in a row .   ( speaking of several times in a row ,  what was the  " i'm snoring and not listening to you joke ?  twice in one scene ?  )   what happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes ?  shia labeouf  ( the kid )  is in the movie for a total of two scenes ,  we know that a-he degrades women ,  and b-he knows smith .  .  .  .  .  .  .  so of course we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm ,   what happened to hero's ?  let's just forget that there are people ,  women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that i have an acquaintance with .  and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air ,  showing off ,  while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot .   don't get me wrong ,  i'm all for spectacle .  but i'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning .   i have to say i've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time .  so thanks alex .    i pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques ,  simpler stories and simpler everything else in films .  .  .  .  .  .  but mainly simpler techniques .   big budget action films :   " you so have to die "
-1	this movie was a mess .  it had the absolute worst editing i have ever seen .  it was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial ,  and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream .   under the messy direction and editing ,  there was a glimmer of something good .  a good idea ,  a compelling spark .  but somewhere it went wrong .   the story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders .  the first thing that is hard to bite into is richard grieco as a priest .  well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well .  the second problem is dennis hopper as the crazy bad guy .  he always plays the crazy bad guy .  very ho hum .   oh ,  a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy ,  horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character  ( grieco )  was experiencing .  and just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords .  not a good sign for any movie .
-1	this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines .  the plot was definitely not worthy of john grisham's name .  no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters .  i didn't even watch the whole thing .  i decided i didn't care who done it ,  then realized there was no  " whodunit "  to care about !
-1	this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store .  don't make the same mistake i did .  this movie is tedious ,  unconvincingly acted ,  and generally boring .  the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered ;  i cringed at every scene they shared .  dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self ;  his role was clearly not a stretch for him .  and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico ,  it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot ;  all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo-irish accents .  odd .  anyway ,  when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store ,  keep walking .
-1	first of all ,  what is good in the movie  ?  some pretty actress  ?  the exotic background  ?  the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting  ( i would have if i had been in their situation )   ?  i don't know .  the storyline is simple  :  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who  ( another abstract painter )  killed his little brother ,  a male prostitute  ( raped by another priest when he was young .  .  .  )  .  i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers ,  art or religion .  dennis hopper is not very good here .  this is the worst episode of the worst season of  " profiler "   ( the serie )  with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences  ( the uncle is the policeman who ,  the girl who lives at another victim's house could have a baby with the priest ,  etc .  ,  etc )  .
-1	i'll give writer/director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived  " thriller .  "  a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo ,  let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs .  a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes ,  although the art direction is not half bad .  the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit ;  this is storytelling at its worst .  no tension ,  no suspense ,  no dread ,  no fear ,  no empathy ,  no catharsis ,  no nothing .  a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom ,  but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer .  i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing .  good for late-night ,  zoned-out viewing only .  you have been warned .
-1	a splendid example of how hollywood could  ( and still can )  take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up .   in the case of  " the big sky ,  "  writer dudley nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the pulitzer prize-winning author ,  a . b .  guthrie .  in so doing ,  they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation .   the epic nature of guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character ,  boone caudill ,  from a naive ,  kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man ,  has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent .  in the movie version ,  boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming .   intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever .  most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the zeb calloway character ,  who was an incidental ,  minor character in the book ,  only occupying a handful of pages .  on the other hand ,  a very important and fascinating character ,  dick summers ,  the veteran pioneer ,  is missing altogether !  !  !  it is also apparent that director hawks decided the zeb character in the movie ,  played by actor hunnicutt ,  wasn't irritating enough .  so zeb/hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious ,  voice-over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing ,  editing ,  and direction .   some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based  ( william wyler's  " ben-hur "  is an excellent example )  .  but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself .   the story is dull and clichéd ,  and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of guthrie's literary vision .  and unfortunately ,  kirk douglas' star appeal ,  which could have helped lift this film ,  was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given .   if you can believe it ,  the film version of guthrie's pulitzer prize-winning sequel ,   " the way west ,  "  also starring kirk ,  is even worse .   in my opinion ,   " the big sky "  further solidifies howard hawks' place as one of the most overrated ,  tepid directors in the history of cinema .
-1	anyone that has see tammuz's child eaters knows that this is a director that can do better .  let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot  ( telefilm anyone ?  ) and that is was a case of second feature jitters .  the characters are one dimensional and over used .  the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific northwest beautifully .   the cinematography is great .  shot almost entirely outside ,  the images are crisp and beautiful .  you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves .   technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart .
-1	not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc ,  but easily the worst ,  never seeing the light of day .  the director is not even canadian ,  but british ,  and boy does it show .  we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons .  the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent ,  and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk .  of course the british character is normal .  the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say  " norm !  !  "  ?  the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes .  the actors always seem to be fidgetting .  are they as bored as the viewer ,  or is this the directors idea of cinema ?  avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films .  a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically .  you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes .
-1	this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine ,  moronic idiots .  the men get stoned/drunk ,  and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene .  the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus ,  or worse ,  milling around like mesmerized cattle .  apparently ,  canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks .  it's the standard knocked-up girlfriend ,  her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before .   every character here is a carping ,  infantile stereotype .  not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower !  and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag !  i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this .  maybe he needed the money .  ian tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment ,  but his talent is wasted here .   as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or karl  who is dead ,  but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind  ( almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock's masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films )  ,  why even bother ?  karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying .   by the end of this wretched movie ,  i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat !
-1	i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored .  how can people possibly give this a 10 ?  it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel-good redemption film  ( i think )  ,  because it doesn't work on that level either .  weak plot ,  bad dialogue ,  terrible acting ;  there's just nothing there .  harvey keitel is decent ,  but has nothing to work with ,  and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible .  the plot progression  ( especially the relationship between byron and ashley )  makes no sense .  it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it ,  without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow .  it's only an hour and a half ,  but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back .
-1	might contain possible spoilers  ( not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter )   why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion ?  sure it's cheaper for them ,  but after a while ,  wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off .  house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all .  some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are :  the voices don't even remotely match up and iago is evil again  ( since when ?  !  )  i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films .  even the movie's musical number  ( which had been disney's specialty for years )  stunk .  i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young .  all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released ,  it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality .
-1	have not watched kids films for some years ,  so i missed  " here come the tigers "  when it first came out .   ( never even saw  " bad news bears "  even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie ,   " warriors ,  "   " man who would be king ,  "  and  " rocky horror picture show ,  "  among others .  )  now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on .  just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job .  lo and behold ,  i spied wes craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer .  he'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the  " scream "  movies .  maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic .  more surprising was fred j .  lincoln in the cast credits as  " aesop ,  "  a wacky character in the movie .  f . j .  lincoln ,  from the '70s to just a few years ago ,  appeared in and produced adult films .  he was associated with the adult spoof  " the ozporns ,  "  and just that title is funnier than all of  " tigers "  attempts at humor combined .  let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel .
-1	the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes i'll never get back .  i knew this was terrible from the get-go ,  with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof .   ( see if they could get away with that in 2008 )  .  my 10-year-old boy is really into baseball right now ,  so we decided to rent it on a rainy day .  even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it ,  i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language .  bad ,  bad movie .  this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears .  completely shameless and completely predictable .  i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well ,  but this one absolutely was not .
-1	i just watched this horrid thing on tv .  needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get .  frankly ,  i don't know how much lower the bar can go .    the characters are composed of one lame stereo-type after another ,  and the obvious attempt at creating another  " bad news bears "  is embarrassing to say the very least .   i have seen some prized turkeys in my time ,  but there is no reason to list any of them since this is  " numero uno "  .   let me put it to you this way ,  i watched the vanilla ice movie ,  because it was so bad it was funny .  this .  .  . this .  .  . is not even that good .
-1	have you ever heard the saying that people  " telegraph their intentions ?  "  well in this movie ,  the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head .  this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better ,  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced .  embeth davidtz's character is not mysterious ,  just wooden ,  and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have .   the bottom line :  obvious plot ,  one-note performances ,  unlikeable characters ,  and grotesque  " southern "  accents employed by british actors .
-1	what a stinkeroo this turned out to be !  !  !  at one time ,  much earlier in her career ,  linda darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an actress ,  but very beautiful and pleasant  ( particularly in films like  " the mark of zorro "  and  " blood and sand "  )  but when i saw this monstrosity ,  the memories of her golden days faded quickly .  the story is unbelievable and farcical ,  the acting second-rate ,  the supporting cast insufferable .  i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter ,  and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked .  added to this ,  was the terrible photography  ( and i am not just referring to the color !  )  everyone associated with this ,  must have shuddered whenever it was shown .
-1	this movie is horrible !  it rivals  " ishtar "  in the number of embarrassingly bad moments .  i would have rated it lower than a 3 ,  save for a couple of funny lines ;  but ,  overall ,  this film was crap !  it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere .  joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever !
-1	when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail .  i love billy crystal ,  my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it .   we were misled ,  in spades .   on my part ,  i felt billy crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film .  sure ,  he cracked a couple of good jokes ,  but as a character he did nothing but take up space .   and poor julia roberts .  in past shows she plays well as a strong-willed ,  self-determined lady .  in this flick ,  she seems completely repressed and had very little fire .  this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching .   ok ,  if i were to find one good thing ,  it would have to be christopher walken .  now that's entertainment .  but ,  just like billy crystal ,  hardly anything is shown of his character .   if you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value ,  go see it .  but if you're looking for a smart ,  romantic comedy ,  this is not your film .  it's none of the above .
-1	shame on julia roberts and john cusack .  they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie .  the storyline was dumb and predictable .  the jokes were not funny .  the romance was not really romance .  i was all too happy when this movie ended .
-1	characters you don't care about ,  relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start .  julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other .  she was actually somewhat endearing in this role .
-1	i found this film to be an utter dissapointment .  the talent available to the director- notably stanley tucci ,  chris walken ,  hank azaria and alan arkin  ( without even mentioning the four main leads ) - have been completely wasted on an unfunny ,  mediocre story ,  whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire ,  stereo-typed characters .  julia roberts is feeble ,  zeta-jones is just plain annoying  ( appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity ,  minus the humour )  ,  crystal just plays his same old hyper-active ,  neurotic ,  annoying alter-ego and cusack simply walks through his part ,  apparently bored with the whole project .   for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy' ,  there is absolutely no romance between the central characters ,  let alone chemistry ,  and as for the comedy-  ( possible spoilers ) well ,  the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever .   ( spoilers )  azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead  ( spoilers )  we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog .  pure genius .   for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work ,  not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast ,  i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas ,  and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them ,  instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out ,  teen-movie' humour at times .   a very poor 4/10 .
-1	billy crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter ,  but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face .  .  .  .  or perhaps just one .  they call it comedy ,  i say it's a waste of my time .
-1	in fact ,  it never was .  i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy .  what a vacuous shambles !  none of these people come close to a cary grant ,  spencer tracy ,  katherine hepburn ,  etc ,  and anyway ,  today's audience isn't as receptive to this facile muck .  writing is trivial .  the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious .  the chemistry between the leading characters is non-existent .  it's interesting that julia roberts seems to think she's a reincarnation of some big star from the  " golden age of hollywood "  ,  whenever that may be .  it's an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride .
-1	the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it ( the crazy filmdirector ) the rest of the movie was just boring . in the first hour or so nothing really happens . jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting . julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck  ( yeah right !  )  into the girl next door  ( where did i see this before ?  )  who gets the guy . for short . i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters . if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch .
-1	i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it .  but this movie was terrible .  i have yet to see why people thought it was funny .  the idea behind it is stupid .  plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb .  why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me !
-1	it was disgusting and painful .  what a waste of a cast !  i swear ,  the audience  ( 1/2 full )  laughed twice in 90 minutes .  this is not a lie .  do not even rent it .   zeta jones was just too mean to be believable .   cusack was ok .  just ok .  i felt sorry for him  ( the actor )  in case people remember this mess .   roberts was the same as she always is .  charming and sweet ,  but with no purpose .  the  " romance "  with john was completely unbelievable .
-1	divorced lawyer rick magruder  ( branagh )  stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss  ( davidtz )  ,  who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car .  rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there ,  seemingly by her father ,  dixon doss  ( duvall )  .  rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick ,  and he then spends the night with her .   rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day ,  asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior .  rick ,  now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her ,  is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison ,  but when he is freed by his local friends ,  rick finds himself in a trouble ,  trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life .
-1	wow ,  what a great cast !  julia roberts ,  john cusack ,  christopher walken ,  catherine zeta-jones ,  hank azaria .  .  . what's that ?  a script ,  you say ?  now you're just being greedy !  surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary ?  you'd think so ,  but no .  america's sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another .  it's like everyone involved woke up before each day's writing/shooting/editing and though  " you know what ?  i've been working pretty hard lately ,  and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names ,  right ?  i'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can .  "  so much potential ,  yet so painful to sit through .  there isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck .  even julia's fat suit is lame .
-1	how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me .  this is a terrible cliché' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done .  it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film .  what's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states .  it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks ,  even if the film is terrible .  i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest .  billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions .  whatever you do ,  don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this .
-1	let me put it another way :  balls .  or ,  how about bollo*ks .  this is truly awful ,  more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise .  julia roberts is a skilled actress ,  and usually her work is of the highest standard .  this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient .  normally she is the consummate professional ,  yet i swear that in her eyes ,  there were signs of bewilderment and despair .   the one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director  ( chris walken )  turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors .  unfortunately ,  that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential .  too little ,  too late .   zeta jones was wooden ,  cusack was cusack ,  and crystal should stick to acting .  the two talented ex-buffy stars had different experiences - green hopelessly mis-cast ,  and balfour under-used .  well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .
-1	and i mean ultra light .  this film features four giant stars ,  about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that .   there really isn't too much to say about this stinker ,  other than that although it has a couple of really good bits ,  most of it isn't very funny .  nor does it work at all as a romance .  how about as a romantic comedy ?  not on your life .  most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated ,  much less amusing .   what's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all .  this movie could have been so much more ,  especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted ,  complete with phony quotes from critics .  the film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews .  but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes ,  it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance .   the same with catherine zeta-jones' character -- the whinny ,  self centered movie star .  zeta-jones does a good job with what she's given ,  but she's given practically nothing .  it's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years .   in the end ,  it is hard to understand what made zeta-jones ,  julia roberts ,  john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship ,  which sinks like a rerun of  " the love boat .  "  in fact ,  as the old joke goes ,  they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal .  it would probably make a better story .  so ,  go ahead and tell us ,  filmmakers ,  what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this ?
-1	if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of alt&#305 ; oklar ,  as it is promised by the tag line ,  you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of alt&#305 ; oklar regarding most famous issues like sex ,  marriage and cheating .  to much nudity ,  which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that alt&#305 ; oklar was unsuccessfully to  " try something new "  as he has quoted .  to much sex centered jokes seems to show that alt&#305 ; oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is  " sex sells .  "  i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique .  however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching alt&#305 ; oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work .
-1	first of all ,  i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema ,  which is because ,  the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline .  this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos ,  as the director and marketing ads imply .  in my mere opinion ,  the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale ( in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country )  cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what i meant .   however ,  the acting is near perfect .  in fact ,  most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what altioklar lacked ;  talent !  all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job ,  even the less experienced ones .   ( like janset )  at least ,  altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation  ,  just because he knows well how to choose the cast .  other than that ,  he is just a media monkey ,  who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent .  come on ,  art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women .  and just because media boasts off ,  no director becomes a milestone in the history of turkish cinema .  just close your ears and o something real artistic ,  i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work .  hope ,  this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach .   in short ;  pros > good acting ,  hot women  ( just kidding !  )   :  )  cons> each and every single thing ,  other than the cast
-1	terrible movie .  if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 ,  that should be banyo .  what a waste of time .  other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing ,  nada ,  zilch ,  nil .  the dialog is cheap ,  and sexual clichés are all over it .  the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own .  the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do .  if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting .  the only good thing i can say about the movie is ,  wait ,  wait ,  there is nothing good i can say about it .  i must have really disliked it to write about it this much .  jeez !
-1	this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible .  as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film ,  how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago ,  but then again i saw this video .  in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script ,  one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe ,  yet this movie lacks them all .  you heard me it lacks them all .  there is not a single point i like about this movie ,  none .  i hate it .  i'm sure anyone will do so too .  the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff ,  yet it fails even at the nudity .  i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so ,  and i definitely recommend you don't do so .  worst movie i've seen in my entire life .  if someone offers you to watch it ,  ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
-1	i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival .  based on a novella by science- fiction author brian aldiss ,  this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry howe ,  conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band .   almost deliberately gimmicky ,  the film is also too clever by half  ( if you'll pardon the pun )  .  by mixing genres ,  styles and moods ,  the directors  ( whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha )  lose their way pretty quickly .  i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not .  flashbacks ,  dream sequences ,  it was all just a bit much .  plus ,  the promised rock and roll just didn't move me .  i was reminded a bit too much at times of hedwig and the angry inch ,  a film i found original and moving .  but in this case ,  the songs just weren't as good ,  nor were the main characters sympathetic .  a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine .
-1	i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by branagh's performance .  he is a fine actor by most accounts ,  but he simply could not pull off the southern accent .  i mean ,  it was deplorable .  it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank .  one of the previous reviewers questioned why u . s .  actors were not cast in this film .  i second that notion .  it's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons ,  but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained .  maybe it was altman ,  but he's a such a great director .  .  .   well ,  i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much .  everybody deserves to screw up here and there .  but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man .
-1	this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time .  it stars shaquille o'neil and is about a rapping genie .  apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece .  the movie gets 1 out of 10 .
-1	would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball .  this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level .  in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp .  he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra .  this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world ,  the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .
-1	this film proves that the  " commercial "  cinema  , or else , the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis . there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on shaquille's name . there is no worth referring to the plot  : it is a bit more perplexed than a knot . what else ? the screen is somewhat dim , o'neal is a bad actor but francis capra is even worse .   rating :  1 / 10 .
-1	there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam ,  and he was whack his rhymes were corny ,  this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin ,  bad casting ,  bad special effects whats next ?  this movie sucks prolly didn't make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp .  .  .   yeah ,  you get it ,  a stupid rhyming genie who can't act ,  in a stupid movie with horrible special effects .  oh ,  and its confusing as hell .  i'm not even gonna go on .  let's just say ,  it belongs in the  " its so bad ,  its funny "  category .  watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh .  but don't expect anything spectacular .
-1	yes ,  kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies ,  but with humanity .  here we have shaq as a rapping genie- yes ,  a rapping genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits ,  all ending in him in a christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him .  so ,  yeah ,  expect really cheesy bits ,  including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky  ( and ,  regrettably ,  not knocking out the two main characters ,  particularly the kid )  .  what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and shaquille o'neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy !  the main plot of the film involves this kid ,  played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of frank capra  ( where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily )  ,  who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box .  then  " hiarity ensues "  as the kid makes the shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father .   this really sappy ,  contrived son and father story would be bad enough ,  as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies  ( i . e .  the  " two chances in life "  speech from father to son )  .  but it's shaquille o'neill who is both the reason to watch the film  ( ironically )  ,  and the obvious sinking crux of it all .  his plot line involves him ,  when not getting the over-talky treatment from capra ,  to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career .  on top of this ,  he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box .  so is there a camp factor to the movie ?  up to a point ,  but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart-felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material .  one might ask if the people making the movie ,  who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting bandwagon ,  if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing .  i'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid .  but i'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the shaq-machine .   so ,  if you want to have a fun night of shaq as genie-turned-rapper-turned-wisecracker ,  all the more fun to you .  hell ,  it might even be interesting to have a shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort steel .  but if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells ,  stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 ,  and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's .
-1	this movie is so ,  so ,  so horrible ,  that it makes angels lose their wings .  shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts ,  like his work in shaq-fu for the nes and his plethora of unbearable rap albums ,  and later ,  the epic serving of horrible film-making that is steel .   there's not a single good thing to be said about this movie .  i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young ,  but i must've been an idiot then ,  because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart .  it's fun to mock .  i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that .  although ,  once the thrill of mocking it is done ,  you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness .   if you see it on tv ,  try this :  consider ,  as your watching the film ,  removing from it all the scenes in which shaq uses his magical genie powers .  if you do that ,  it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him .  that's kinda funny ,  and disturbing .   a horrible example of film .  do not ,  unless looking to mock it ,  see this movie .
-1	what was the point of this movie ?  what was the plot ?  i do not know .  shaq can't act ,  people don't know how to direct ,  and i am kazaam !  a genie who raps ?  come on .  maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this .  i remember i watched this just to kill time .  it didn't really interest me .  i just remember thinking ,   " who put shaq in this movie ?  ?  ?  "  the whole story seemed stupid too .  it made no sense whatsoever .  i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen .  i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about .  i  " wish "  this movie would go away .
-1	now ,  i'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews ,  and say ,   " hmm .  .  .  this isn't so bad !  "  i loved the cable guy ,  and thought that my big fat independent movie was great .  keep in mind ,  i really didn't start watching this with high hopes ,  but i figured that maybe .  .  .  just maybe .  .  .  it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it .  i was wrong .  at no point at all during my suffering through this  " film "   ( and i use that term sparingly )  was i even close to being mildly entertained .  to start ,  shaq makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting .  i hate rap music ,  but as far as i could tell ,  an amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him .  the main character is simply annoying ,  and not a character that it's easy to like .  quite frankly ,  i would rather eat a greasy turd out of a harlequin fetus' bloody sores than watch this again .
-1	let me give a quick summery of the film :  a rotten ,  rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam :  a rapping genie .  like all genies ,  he grants 3 wishes but ,  being good natured ,  also helps max with his personal life ,  as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime .  during all this ,  kazaam raps from time to time ,   ( also showcasing shaq's dismal rap skills )  .   this movie proves what we all know :  athletes need to stick to sports .  i admit that it never looked like an oscar-worthy movie ,  but everything about this waste of film is horrible .  the characters are either unlikable or stupid ,  the plot is not even worth mentioning ,  the dialog is a joke ,  and shaq is only a quarter of the problem .  hell ,  even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke .  i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big  ( no pun intended )  at the time .  i honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time .  shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .
-1	how a director of altman's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with ,  or to care about what happens to ,  a lead character who is neurotic ,  a whiner ,  a jerk with no redeeming qualities -- that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work .  a monstrous piece of trash .  in addition to this crippling flaw ,  the plot line requires serious concentration to follow .  the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience .  this latter issue is at the core of the film :  it represents directorial self-indulgence with profound contempt for the taste ,  values ,  and intelligence of the viewer .  very unusual for mr .  altman .   patrick watson
-1	ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary :  genie comes out of ghetto boom box ,  gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes ,  the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what ,  shaq sucks at rapping ,  and i guess thats it .   so mainly i laughed ,  i cried .  .  .  .  .  . but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player/rapper and boy with shaggy hair .   i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh .   i'm going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b/c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes .   if i had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn't waste money on making this .
-1	reviewing kazaam and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all--after all ,  critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade !  so the fact that i say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise .  it's like someone talking about wwii--practically no one says that was a good thing ,  right ?  !  the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is  " why did they make this in the first place ?  !  "  .  after all ,  it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible .  but ,  movies like ed  ( a baseball playing chimp )  ,  cool as ice  ( starring the ever-popular vanilla ice )  ,  troll 2  ( which doesn't even have any trolls in it )  ,  baby geniuses  ( einstain-like superhero babies )  and pinocchio in outer space  ( huh !  ?  !  )  prove that any idea ,  no matter how dumb ,  can make it to the big screen !  so ,  the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal' !    the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school .  like the punk from free willy ,  this kid is somehow 'misunderstood'  ( in other words ,  a total brat )  and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is ,  by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown .  just once ,  i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film !  eventually ,  while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him ,  the genie kazaam  ( shaquille o'neal ) is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes .  but ,  the kid doesn't believe him and the genie's magic seems a tad rusty .   eventually the brat does realize that kazaam is for real .  however ,  unlike most kids ,  he withholds making his wishes so ,  in the meantime ,  kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant .  and ,  according to the cliché ,  you know that by the end of the film ,  max and kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed .  oh ,  and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé  ( i'm gonna gag )  .  apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes .   as for kazaam ,  shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap .  .  . very poorly .  i'm a middle-aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well !  he's an amazing basketball player and i've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper .  .  . no way !  as far as his acting goes ,  he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things .   so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard ?  through the first two-thirds of the movie ,  i would have said no .  shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script .  however ,  later in the film ,  the bad becomes horrid--as kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed .  and ,  out of nowhere ,  the plot gets really ,  really weird--as the guy who wants to make kazaam a rap star (  ?  !  ?  !  )  turns out to be an evil mobster !  and ,  oddly ,  this guy seems to accept that kazaam is a genie with no hesitation !    in addition ,  the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad .  i know that the kid was annoying ,  but this is supposed to be a kids' film !  !  what part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand ?  !  ?  then ,  in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history ,  kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination !  this ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in the black hole .  .  . and boy ,  did it make my brain hurt !  !  uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear !  !  !   overall ,  it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane .  yes ,  folks ,  with a messed up message ,  bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters ,  this is one wretched film .  sadly ,  given the idea and actors ,  it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse !  !   by the way ,  if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good ,  try the british made for tv film  " bernard and the genie " --a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish .
-1	the only reason i dvrd this movie was because 1 .  i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 .  i've always heard how awful it was .  the movie did not disappoint .  the best parts were shaq's outfits .  the worst parts were ,  well ,  just about everything else .  my 12 year old son and i just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn't wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his !  but for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it ,  the story sucked you in ,  like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit ,  it was hypnotic .  but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched  " kazzam "  .
-1	if you are a fan of really bad movies ,  and you think there funny ,  you will the great acting of shaq .  first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works .  shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies .  well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid .  i would give this a zero but that is impossible .
-1	this movie has successfully proved what we all already know ,  that professional basket-ball players suck at everything besides playing basket-ball .  especially rapping and acting .  i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is .  first of all ,  is it just me ,  or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen ?  i mean ,  his teeth could be used as a can-opener .  secondly ,  why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when ,  even though he has magical powers ,  he sucks horribly at making music ?  third ,  i have read the bible .  in no way shape or form did it say that jesus made genies .  fourth ,  what was the deal with all the crappy special effects ?  i assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that .  fifth ,  why did the ending suck so badly ?  and what the hell is a djin ?  and finally ,  whoever created the nightmare known as kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the eiffel tower ,  because this movie take the word  " suck "  to an entirely new level .
-1	i was given the book version of kazaam for my 8th birthday ,  and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie ,  but this time they were wrong .  at least with the movie it's over soon .   the acting in this is terrible ,  which i expected from a film with shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster  ( which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there )  .  the kid in the film that plays max is whiny and a terrible actor .  he's bullied by neighborhood kids ,  which i don't blame them because he's a little douche bag .   the story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché .  about a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father .   even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea .  it's a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it's an embarrassment and should have never been made .  i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks ,  but you should already know just by reading the plot .
-1	this is the worst film i have ever seen . i was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough .  the plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character . i could get more entertainment watching static .  i gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers .  avoid this movie at all costs .
-1	there's only one thing i need to say about this movie - the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis capra's character about wanting to be a genie ;  never see this movie .  the story is horrible ,  the acting is terrible  ( c'mon ,  it's shaq !  )  and i'd rather see capra in free willy  ( equally horrible )  twice before ever seeing this movie .
-1	this is one of the most god-awful movies ever .  shaq better just stick to basketball .  this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back .  i will make fun of this movie until i die ,  and then some .  it is so horrible it is not even funny .  mst3000 would have a blast with this one .
-1	what a pathetic movie .   i won't waste much time commenting about it .  i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it .   let me leave it simply with - shaq has no business being an actor or singer .  he is utterly without talent at both discplines .  it's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds .   much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is shaq .
-1	the first half of this version was the best i've seen  ( and i think i've seen every version of jane eyre ever made )  .  the development of jane's childhood and character were exceptional .  then ,  it was as though someone said  " uh oh ,  this is running too long ,  "  and hacked the rest of the story to shreds .  the major scenes ,  when included at all ,  are glossed over ,  combined ,  and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline .  there was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow .  the big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope ,  and then the end dashed it .
-1	as a  " jane eyre "  fan i was excited when this movie came out .   " at last ,  "  i thought ,   " someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author .  "  wrong !  !  !  if the casting director was intending to cast a  " jane "  who was plain he certainly succeeded .  however ,  surely he could have found one who could also act .  where was the tension between jane and rochester ?  where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere ?  where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother ?  finally ,  why was the plot changed at the end ?  one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book .  what a disappointment
-1	there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie .  is it the lawyer played by kenneth branagh that we're supposed to be pulling for ?  well ,  let's see -- we learn he's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities .  he treats his coworkers like cattle ,  gets them involved in his own personal crisis  ( in the process ,  getting one of them killed )  ,  jeopardizes the safety of his kids ,  threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend ,  tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what ?  because he was thinking with his little head !  i was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp .  .  . it would have made for a far more satisfying ending .
-1	i love the book ,   " jane eyre "  and have seen many versions of it .  all have their strong points and their faults .  however ,  this was one of the worst i have seen .  i didn't care about jane or mr .  rochester .  charlotte gainsbourg  ( jane )  was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part ,  but she had no emotion in any of her lines .  i couldn't imagine what mr .  rochester saw in her .    that brings us to mr .  rochester .  william hurt had even less emotion than jane ,  if that were possible .  how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery ,  but it certainly didn't hold my attention .  perhaps the director  ( zeffrelli )  fell asleep during the production .   the timothy dalton  ( too handsome for mr .  rochester !  )  version is far more faithful to the book ,  but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr .  rochester in the 1997 a/e version  ( which is not all that true to the book )  .   trying to find something positive about this movie :  geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role .
-1	oh just what i needed , another movie about 19th century england .  which is pretty much like regular england , only nobody's vandalising football stadiums . in this picturesque setting of lords , dames and other randomly chosen titles , charlotte gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane eyre , from that novel nobody has ever read willingly . jane usually hangs out in mr . rochester's crib , where she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time . one day , mr . rochester ( william hurt on auto-pilot ) comes back to fall in love with jane and all that , but there's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic . oops , that wasn't in the brochure . after some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire ( they probably rented the set )  , the movie finally comes to an end . everything looked really authentic , that's something i guess . but then again , nah .
-1	this 1996 movie was the first adaptation of jane eyre that i ever watched and when i did so i was appalled by it .  so much of the novel had been left out and i considered william hurt to be terribly miscast as rochester .  since then i have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel ,  the three short versions of '44 ,  '70 and '97 and the three mini series of '73 ,  '83 and 2006 ,  and i have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse rochesters .   this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned .  director franco zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky ,  of lonely rochester standing on a rock ,  and of jane looking out of the window - but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life .  in addition ,  his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes .  as a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between jane and rochester ,  and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse .  there are a number of short conversations between rochester and jane ,  each of them beautifully staged ,  but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other .  we know that they are supposed to fall in love ,  but we never see it actually happen .  the scene in which rochester wants to find out jane's reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded mason has left the house is completely missing ,  and the farewell scene ,  the most important scene - the climax - of the novel is reduced to four sentences .  zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for brontë's superb lines ,  neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten ,  but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out .  what remains is just a glimpse of the novel ,  which does no justice to charlotte brontë's masterpiece .   the cast is a mixed bag :  while fiona shaw is an excellent mrs reed ,  anna paquin's young jane is more an ill-mannered ,  pout lolita than a lonely little girl ,  longing for love .  the ever-reliable joan plowright makes a very likable ,  but far too shrewd mrs fairfaix ,  and one cannot help feeling that billie whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain-looking ,  hard-working grace poole .  charlotte gainsbourgh as the grown-up heroine ,  however ,  is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre .  looking every bit like 18 ,  thin and frail ,  with irregular ,  strong features ,  she comes closest to my inner vision of jane than any other actress in that role .  and during the first 15 minutes of her screen time i was enchanted by her performance .  gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask .  but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane's character any further .  as a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues ,  gainsbourgh's portrayal of jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory .  this is a pity ,  as with a better script charlotte gainsbourgh might have been as good a jane as zelah clarke in the '83 version .   but while it is still obvious that gainsbourgh is trying to play jane ,  there is no trace whatsoever of rochester in the character that william hurt portrays .  hurt ,  who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies ,  must have been aware that he was physically and type-wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the rochester of the novel .  his rochester ,  besides being blond and blue-eyed ,  is a soft-spoken ,  well-mannered nobleman ,  shy and quiet ,  slightly queer and eccentric ,  but basically good-natured and mild .  he is so far from being irascible ,  moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous .  additionally ,  during many moments of the movie ,  hurt's facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness .  particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open .  if you compare his rochester to the strong-willed and charming protagonist of the novel ,  simply bursting with energy and temperament ,  it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in hurt's performance .  still ,  he offends me less than the rochesters in the '70 ,  '97 and 2006 versions and i would in general rank this jane eyre higher than these three other ones .  hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so ,  whereas george c .  scott ,  ciaràn hinds and toby stephens thought they could ,  but failed miserably ,  and i'd rather watch a character other than rochester than a rochester who is badly played .  and i'd rather watch a jane eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today's couple in a starbucks café .  of course this jane eyre is a failure ,  but at least it is an inoffensive one ,  which is more than one can say of the '97 and 2006 adaptations .  i would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation :  you will not find jane eyre ,  but at least you will find a beautifully made movie .
-1	having read the novel before seeing this film ,  i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot .  i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of bronte's work ,  and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story .  in the condensing of the film to a short 2hours ,  the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional ,  thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding .  there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre ,  so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial .  this is such an injustice to bronte's novel ; you are given no impression of jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts rochester to her ,  and his arrogance which attracts jane to him .   despite to poor scripting ,  i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely ,  namely mrs fairfax and grace poole ,  however overall the production was poor .  given a better scripting ,  perhaps the film would have been more successful .  see  " jane eyre "   ( 1970 )  with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production .
-1	i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched ,  and i would also say rushed .  it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school .  but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it doesn't fully make sense .  for example jane & mr rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage !  !  !  the actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story . the actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice .  i'm sorry to say it but i didn't really enjoy this version . the 1970 version with susanna york & george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke & timothy dalton in the 2 main roles .  i love it so much i watch it regularly . there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins .
-1	pros :  nothing  cons :  everything  plot summary :  a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies .   review :  never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles .  filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks ,  tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame ,  forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore that's more gross than frightening .  how does a movie like this even get made ?  simply put ,  avoid tzc like a sexually-transmitted disease .   my last 2 cents :  humorously enough ,  this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films .  they're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this .   my rating :  1 out of 10 ( if it were up to me ,  this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion )
-1	what was franco zeffirelli thinking ?  was hollywood responsible for this travesty ,  or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte bronte's classic ?  i don't think i can improve on a comment i read below ,  so i'll just paraphrase it :   " jane eyre is a great great book ,  the screenwriter should read it sometime .  "  it's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast .  but pity the actors ,  because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes .  the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun .  .  . deleted from the script .  the marriage proposal ,  the fortune teller .  .  . gone .  the allusions ,  half joking ,  half sincerely felt ,  to jane as a fairy sprite from olde england come to rescue rochester in his despair .  .  . eliminated .   it is unfortunate that zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane's interactions with the rivers family .  but it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written .   do yourself a favor and go find the 1983  (  ?  )  mini series with timothy dalton .
-1	i read the novel 'jane eyre' for the first time back in 1986 .  it was round that time that i saw the bbc-version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke .  it was an excellent version and very much like the book .  years later ,  i laid eyes on this version and was horrified .  william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester .  mr rochester is a passionate character ,  where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice .  the same goes for charlotte gainsborough .  it was like watching two zombies together .  this is story about love and passion ,  but i couldn't see it in this version .  no ,  back to the bbc-version .  a wonderful time is guaranteed .
-1	i think i've seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor ,  except for the rainmaker ,  but this one is so bad it's unbelievable  warning spoilerish  it's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do .  he's a lawyer for christ's sake .  why when his children go missing does he not call the police .  oh yes it's because all the police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked .   when he's arrested for murder they just let him go free ,  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing .    why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home .   the police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient ,  they don't bother to interview his daughter .   as for the ridiculous ending .   in summary ,  silly ,  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time .   0/10  one of the worst films ever made .
-1	jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it .  i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about .  this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book .   the whole 'red room' is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in .  in the book the 'red room' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane's life .  helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early .  in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head .  the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie .   do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .
-1	i don't like using the word  " awful "  to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time ,  effort ,  talent and money is spent in its creation but zefferelli's attempt to adapt charlotte brontë's novel 'jane eyre' is a total waste of time .   the script is lacking in finesse and power ,  everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms ,  leaving little to the imagination .  the lead actors are woefully miscast ,  clearly hired for their star names ,  and the musical score drippy and dull .  charlotte gainsbourg and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all .  she is like a wet noodle ,  worse even than joan fontaine ,  who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion .  and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy .  of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick .   joan plowright's mrs fairfax is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out .    there is no mystery surrounding the story of rochester's first wife .  the role of the would-be second wife ,  played like a barbie doll by elle macphearson ,  is an empty cipher .   fiona shaw ,  a very great actress ,  is completely wasted as jane's aunt ,  mrs reed .  she would have been better-cast as mrs fairfax .  only amanda root ,  as jane's beloved school teacher ,  evokes any authentic sympathy or believability .    i saw this version of 'jane eyre' after viewing robert young's for british television ,  made in 1997 ,  starring ciaran hinds ,  samantha morgan and gemma jones .  there is no comparison .  young's vital ,  romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to zefferelli's wet squib .   i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton ,  about which i've read some very good things on this web-site .  i am amazed at how many people liked zefferelli's yorkshire picture book .    about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored ,  beyond that it is a complete dud .
-1	this version is pretty insipid ,  i'm afraid .  jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood ,  but william hurt's weary ,  throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored ,  petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt !  i also can't believe that they eliminated edward's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book ,  one of the most moving moments in literature .  i do appreciate that they finally used such a young ,  plain woman to play jane ,  a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 ,  but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel ,  please see the 70's version with george c .  scott and susannah york .  york was too old ,  tall and pretty to play jane ,  but no one has touched rochester's character the way that scott did .
-1	what made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to charlotte bronte's brilliance of the original classic story .  i was deeply disappointed to find that this movie ,  which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste ,  had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful .  much of the witty back and forth between the main characters ,  jane eyre and mr .  rochester ,  seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor .  also missing was jane eyre's charismatic sense of self ,  which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all .  the original jane eyre was a hero .  the woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over ,  including one of the greatest parts of the story when jane runs away from thornfield and mr .  rochester .  her struggle to find food and shelter ,  her shame at having to beg for bread ,  the threat of freezing to death in the cold ,  all to get away from a man she loved were ,  in my opinion ,  poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie .  the title character seemed dry and uninspired .  the story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book ,  i cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting .  the screenplay and direction did little if any credit to the classic story .
-1	i can't say this is the worst film of all time ,  but only because there are still some movies i haven't seen ,  yet !  this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time !  the director suffers from the same issues he had with  " there will be blood "   ( though he wasn't quite as bad in that film .  the whole movie it feels like you're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities .  it's like he sits in his little director's chair and thinks  " how would a great filmmaker handle this scene ?  "  he just doesn't have it in him .  i don't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker .  there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished ,  but nothing was brought to ripen .  the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history .  one by one as we see the characters singing ,  and i squirmed in my seat ,  i kept saying  " please ,  please ,  just don't have the guy on the brink of death singing ,  too !  "  sure enough ,  massive failure !
-1	this ambitious film suffers most from writer/director paul thomas anderson's delusions of grandeur .  highly derivative of much better material  ( altman's  " nashville ,  "  lumet's  " network "  )  ,  this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere .  a couple of misguided detours along the way  ( an embarrassing musical interlude ,  a biblical plague )  don't help matters .  neither does the uneven level of performances .  especially bad :  william h .  macy ,  whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether ;  julianne moore ,  for her unconvincing angst .  and how many times must we see john c .  reilly's sad sack shtick  (  " chicago "  and  " the hours "  will suffice )  ?  tom cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist ,  foul-mouthed holy roller was rather amusing .  speaking of foul mouths ,  the script was so loaded with  " f "  bombs ,  they lost their impact in no time .  don't even talk about that awful soundtrack ,  full of insipid and annoying vocals by aimee mann .  her extended rendition of  " one ,  "  a maudlin number to begin with ,  drove me to distraction at the start of the film .  i should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours ,  by which time i'd been pushed to the brink of hell .  one redeeming feature ,  which i haven't seen mentioned in other reviews ,  is the best performance in the bunch ,  by unknown melora walters in the role of claudia ,  the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction .  her credibility exceeded all others by far .  this film took itself way too seriously and just didn't know when to end .
-1	that's not just my considered verdict on this film ,  but also on the bulk of what has been written about it .  now don't get me wrong here either ,  i'm not a total philistine ,  i didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever ,  i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff ,  i swear .   'magnolia' is poor ,  and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed .  long winded ,  self indulgent ,  rambling nonsense from start to finish ,  there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie .  there's some high calibre actors fair enough ,  and none turns in an average or worse performance .  furthermore ,  my wife  ( a self confessed tom cruise hater )  tells me it's his career best performance by far .  but the plot is so completely unengaging ,  meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something .   it doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with  ( well i didn't think so ,  but i don't like most people admittedly )  .  they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length ,  demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route .  yadda yadda yadda .  the soundtrack's dire as well ,  with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisette .   all in all ,  it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat .  the bit with the frogs is good though .
-1	magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming ,  shrieking ,  overwrought ,  hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret ,  guilt and pain .  pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess .   a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent ,  and they were .  i just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused .   i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film .  the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at .  but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display .  i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself ,  but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution .  throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament .   i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i'll be looking for the soundtrack cd .  in short ,  a good movie to look at and listen to  ( the music ,  that is )  if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
-1	1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray .  first they sent us to eyes wide shut .  then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year .  what is it about ?  who the heck knows .  its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting .  i always like to stay and watch the credits ,  but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough .  most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at ,  felt pretty much the same way .  dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers .  it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful .
-1	my guess is that this director/writer had something to say .  let's see ,  what it could have been .  .  .  a .  frog storms would be creepy ?  b .  can i get someone like tom cruise to say the  " c "  word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter ?  c .  cast my wife and get her to say the  " f "  word every 2 seconds .  this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm .  the rest was a relentless ,  over-long  ( under-edited )  ,  over-indulgent failure .  glad so many of you enjoyed it !
-1	this movie is like real life ,  by which i mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so ,  and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast  ( their invisibility being due to the  " experimental "  lighting as mentioned by many reviewers )  .    a big bore .  no big surprise that altman helms this - he is a very variable performer  ( yes we all loved  " gosford park "  ,  but  " pret a porter "  anyone ?  kansas city ?  dr t .  and the women ?  aaargh )  ,  but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale ,  and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film .  and no ,  it is not  " so bad it's good "  .   it's just bad .
-1	normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films ,  but this one really annoyed me .  all they did was swear .  for the whole film .   ( and ,  as someone else noted ,  get cancer )  it was boring ,  rambling and pretentious .  i wouldnt if i were you .    its also not that i dont like films which ,  as most people who like it will claim 'observe life' .  i love eat drink man woman ,  and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives .  but i could relate to them .  i have never met anyone who swore as much as the 'actors' in this film ,  and i used to work on a construction site .  so go figure .  having said that william h .  macy made me grin .  once .    2/10 .  avoid ,  unless you enjoy tedium .
-1	i wanted to like magnolia .  the plot reminded me of grand canyon  ( which i liked )  .  4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost .  i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end ,  little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours .  thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre .  i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours .  the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene .  my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit .  it was a unique movie ,  but a bad ,  boring ,  and pointless movie .
-1	sorry did i miss something ?  did i walk out early ?  the first ten minutes of unusual  ( and untrue !  )  stories had me thinking  " this is going to be a classic "  but it was all down hill from there !  the acting was brilliant ,  for what it's worth william h macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in .  but it never seemed to connect .  i was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly .  . it rains frog ?  ?  it was if the writer said  " i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely .  .  .  . oh sod it i'll just have it raining frogs "  .  i like clever movies ,  i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring .  4/10
-1	great cast .  great acting .  unpredictable story line for the first half  hour or so .  i was really wanting to know what was going to  happen to each of these unredeeming characters ,  and how their  seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined .  but when  the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players ,  they  mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill  for the last two hours .  i kept thinking it would get better ,  but it only  got worse .  don't believe the reviews .  this is a waste of time .    think about it -- tom cruise made ugly -- why ?  the gorgeous  hunky bartender wearing braces -- why ?  i know it had to do with  the plot ,  but without them ,  at least there would have been one  attractive cast member to remember .
-1	" magnolia "  is a preposterous ,  bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little .  like  " eyes wide shut ,  "   " magnolia "  is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence .  the camera swoops through hallways and corridors ,  catching glimpses of sad characters .  where is the reason to care for these people ?  the common theme seems to be people who yell a lot ,  who can't care for others  ( except for john c .  reilly's and philip seymour hoffman's characters )  ,  and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying .  i was reminded of how much i disliked  " shine "  because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by armin mueller-stahl .  there are so many unattractive ,  unappealing characters here ,  why would we want to spend time with them ?   having said that ,  there is nothing held back about  " magnolia .  "  paul thomas anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon .  there are two ideas in particular that bomb .  both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film .  one has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of aimee mann's coffeehouse folk songs .  sweet ,  but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together .  the other idea i refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous .    " magnolia "  has a lot of great acting .  particularly tom cruise who unleashes a performance i didn't know he had in him .  and john c .  reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory .  but it all adds up to nothing .  when the secret unexpected event happened ,  a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said ,   " this is stupid !  "  my feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree .
-1	i can't tell you how angry i was after seing this movie .  the characters are not the slightest bit interesting ,  and the plot is non-existant .  so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other ,  hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish ,  what do we get ?  ?  ?  a storm of frogs .  now yes ,  i understand the references to the bible  ( exodus )  and the underlying theme ,  but first of all ,  it was presented with absolutely no resolution ,  and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible  ( a significant portion of the population )  or charles fort  ( a still larger portion )  .  as a somewhat well read person ,  i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode .   don't waste your time .  it would be better spent reading .  .  .    .  .  . well anything to be honest
-1	the minute you give an 'art film' 1/10 ,  you have people baying for your ignorant ,  half-ass-ed ,  artistically retarded blood .  i won't try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the 'art house cinema' i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown 'cult classic' a 10/10 .  all i ask is that someone explain to me the point ,  purpose and message of this film .   here is how i would summarize the film :  opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence .  this followed by  ( in a nutshell ,  to save you 3 hours of pain )  the following - a children's game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter ,  who he may or may not have raped when she was a child ,  and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues ,  while the game-show's star contestant decides that he doesn't want to be a failed child prodigy ,  a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s ,  who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery' ,  while the game show's producer ,  himself dying of lung cancer ,  asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago ,  and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru ,  even as mr .  producer's second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man ;  and oh ,  eventually ,  it rains frogs  ( you read correctly )  .  and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless ,  literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than ,  possibly ,  to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic' .    you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie  ( and in turn of not confusing you )  if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently ,  maybe in a few sentences instead of just one .  .  .  well ,  now you know how i feel .
-1	this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children's comic !  i gave it 2 out of 10 for it's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was good .   this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies .  no interviews with surviving cast members ,  crew members ,  production team members etc .  ,  or their friends ,  families ,  and any biographers of those people .  in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the  ( supposedly )  biographical book .  as for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened .
-1	i happened to love the show growing up ,  along with millions of others .  so i tuned in to this movie ,  thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun .   wrong !  i just have to wonder ,  at the end of this ,  was charlie's angels really that boring ?  i don't seem to remember it as such .  but this movie ,  as bad as movies of this type can be ,  bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show .  i did see it all ,  in spite of the negatives ,  it wasn't unwatchable .  but it was very bland ,  which i do not fault the performers for at all ,  particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them .  the movie just wasn't that interesting .  it tried to make each angel a  " character "  .   ( one angel is to feisty ,  one is the  " good girl "  ,  one is to into her husband .  .  .  .  )  , all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes .  the excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was .  .  .  . dialog .  that's pretty much it .   not awful .  not the worst of tv movies .  but missable .
-1	it was everything this isn't :  it had pace ,  pop ,  and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery .  it also had a decent script .  this one had me scratching my head .  if farrah isn't really  " serious "  about a career ,  why does she have a manager  ( and why is he wasting his time )  ?  if kate and barney are  " artists ,  "  why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows  ( like the  " brady bunch "  movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare ,  only to find himself on bb )  ?  they weren't industry names ,  but they weren't exactly starving ,  either .  and while they got the history right  ( the poster was released before farrah got the show )  ,  silverman rejecting pitches for  " funniest home videos "  and  " american idol "  and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen .   what bothered me was how spelling's role is distorted .  he's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither .  and how he  " comes up "  with the  " idea "  for ca was is laughable !   how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah's oral contract when the others were signed ?  and why didn't farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva ,  but because majors wanted her to ?  this is why ,  when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the  " bad girl "   ( like suzanne somers )  ,  it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the  " three's company "  pic delivered .
-1	noting the cast ,  i recently watched this movie on tcm ,  hoping for an under-appreciated gem ,  as i regard many films from the 30's .  this is no gem - not even semi-precious .  the anachronistic clothing and 1930's rolls royce limo hit you immediately .  the casting is strange ,  also .  but mostly ,  there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices .  this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise ,  but the components aren't mixed according to the right recipe .  it simply doesn't come together like it should .  and that's a shame .  with a few rather obvious ,  but minor alterations ,  this might have been a very good movie .   the film is about an american showgirl  ( jean harlow )  seeking a rich british husband - preferably from the nobility .  she meets franchot tone and his buddy ,  who are on a lark in a rolls royce owned by his buddy's employer .  harlow mistakenly assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls ,  and she sets her sights on him .  this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction .    however ,  tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a german 5th columnist on the eve of wwi ,  and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart .  tone and harlow are married ,  but just as the honeymoon begins ,  he is gunned down by a mata hari-type  ( benita hume )  ,  and harlow flees the scene ,  with a bystander accusing her of tone's murder .   ( in fact ,  tone recovers from the wounds .  )   harlow flees to france ,  where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy french cad  ( cary grant )  .  tone ,  now in the army ,  and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in grant's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash .  in the following scene ,  tone accuses harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold-digger .  harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic !  that is one of those unreal ,  movie-plot-device break-downs in the story .   then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman  ( hume )  who shot him .  she is on hand to watch her paramour ,  grant ,  test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england .  incredibly ,  both hume and tone dimly recognize each other ,  but simply can't place where from !  okay ,  so tone was shot and almost died ;  perhaps his memory is a little out of whack .  but how many men did hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks ?   ( she does not seem to be faking the memory lapse .  )   this is inexplicable and unnecessary .  hume should have absolutely recognized him ,  but played it coy when she realized that tone wasn't able to place her .  that would have been a much better treatment of that issue .   the finale also is very unsatisfying .  the movie ,  as made ,  has tone and harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad ,  grant ,  leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero .  then harlow and tone just walk away .  it is noble to preserve the french public's perception of their national war hero ,  but very unsatisfying as a love story !   what the film begs for is this :  harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder ;  tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her ;  he then carries a torch for her ,  even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve grant's reputation .  meanwhile ,  harlow finally recognizes grant for the cad he is .  then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is ,  harlow rekindles feelings for him ,  too .  at film's end ,  the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of grant's death .  after grant's hero's burial ,  we see them embrace and kiss at the fade-out .  that would have made a nice little movie .  for cary grant fans ,  it would have been even better had tone played the french cad who is killed and grant the long-suffering first husband ,  reunited with harlow .   it is incomprehensible that franchot tone is cast as the irishman living in england ,  while cary grant is cast as the frenchman .  this movie would have been much better had they reversed roles .  that also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been .  .  .
-1	i rented this dvd for two reasons .  a cast of great actors ,  and the director ,  even though robert altman can be hit or miss .  in this case ,  it was a big miss .  altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester .  after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  " dead again "  ,  i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey ,  and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation .  robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time oscar winners .  on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one .  duvall was once a great actor in excellent films ,  even though his best performance was not  " tender mercies "  ,  but  " the great santini "  .  this movie was truly a big waste of time .  i give it a 2 out of 10 .
-1	this may have been made for the hell of it ,  but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years ,  the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case !  !  !  i'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too ,  i'm glad i only rented .  i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter ,  i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future ,  that is ,  if he is still in work .   notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing ,  don't buy it !  !  !  !  !
-1	sadly , this is not 'the best british gore film since hellraiser' ,  though the dvd cover claims this ,  which is what tricked me into buying it .  it is ,  however ,  an homage to many of the great horrors of old ,  films from most notably the amicus stable .   cradle .  .  .  is shot on mini dv ,  which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie ,  can be done so much better .  every scene ,  set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way  ( standard key ,  fill ,  rear setup )  ,  which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece .  the gore content is ,  quite frankly ,  laughable .  from the opening shots where we see a man's obviously foam rubber head torn apart ,  through to tacky cheap prop hammers ,  the creature effects and the terrible cg ,  there was nothing in there that impressed me at all .   the acting is abominable ,  from the near-comatose detective to the brummie dwarf ,  via dani filth ,  the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed .  each of the substories is more formulaic than the last ,  and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs .  look out for the 'mental asylum' - a georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside ,  and the most bizarre  ( and not in a good way )  padded cell i have seen .   it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering  ( nay ,  running )  away at any available opportunity .  i actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running .   it does ,  however ,  mark one of the last known appearances of emily booth's breasts ,  which i guess is one  ( um ,  two )  things it has going for it .  once that's out of the way though ,  it is all downhill .   i've heard people say good things about alex chandon ,  and i would love to believe them ,  but on this evidence i'm not likely to .  if you want a decent homage to amicus ,  avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead .   currently battling it out with blair witch 2 :  book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen .
-1	it surprisingly had a plot !   ;  )  i've seen movies with less plot  ( i don't wanna mention asian movies but .  .  .  )  .  i thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this ,  and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad .  there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens .  although i do think that about a lot of movies ,  in this case it was horrible ,  of course .   it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes .  the acting was bad but i've seen worse .  the movie was bad but i've seen worse .  watching this film is an experience between boredom ,  laughing fits ,  death wish ,  sadism ,  horniness and entertainment on a low level .   so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you .   i gave it 3/10 ,  because it can be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood .
-1	not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half-way through .  .  .  . but then with this one ,  i was only 15 minutes in when i considered .  unfortunately ,  i did make it all the way through .  make sure that you do not .   it's not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual .  it's that it's not any of those things ,  yet it so desperately wants to be all of them .  instead ,  it's boring ,  trite ,  ordinary ,  predictable ,  and unexceptionally poorly executed  ( shot on video ,  high school special effects ,  no sense of even basic visual storytelling ,  dialog barely audible .  .  . not that it's worth hearing ,  though )  .   this movie is proof for the argument that even the straight-to-video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere .
-1	the directors cut version ,  which was the one i saw ,  was very long for this type of movie .  almost two hours is way too long .  if you have the choice ,  definitely go for the non-directors cut .   the main plot is almost not taken up at all ,  the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes ,  which are connected but the feeling is that they're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence .  the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there .   as a horror movie it doesn't work .  you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition  ( character is presented ,  15 minutes later character is dead )  .  this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .
-1	by all accounts ,  this could have been an interesting film .  featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth ,  starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as  " the future of british horror "  ,  i expected alex chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype .   i was wrong .   everything about this film is either cliche or inept .  the short story anthology setup was done to death  ( and much better )  in the seventies and eighties .  admittedly ,  the idea of 'the sick room' did send a chill down my spine ,  but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting .   chandon cannot write dialogue .  every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence  ( the typical 'cop on the edge' formula .  funny ,  i'm sure i've seen that somewhere else before .  .  .  )  no chandon ,  you are not tarantino .  or scorsese .  it sounds bad .  add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting  ( don't get me wrong ,  dani filth is a great singer and musician ,  but actor he ain't )  and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing .  give me bruce campbell any day .   the visual effects are on the whole poor ,  with some atrocious cgi ,  awful gore effects  ( for goodness sakes ,  peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget )  and editing filters that shriek over-use !  as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth's score .  .  .  man ,  they should sue .   the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously ,  trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience .  too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects  ( eg :  maniac ,  zombie flesh eaters ,  the beyond ,  suspiria etc )  ,  rendering cradle of fear ,  in my mind ,  second-rate and obsolete .   i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares .   better luck next time .
-1	normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b-horror movies .  to me the basic principals behind a b-horror movie is it's camp value ,  heavy gore ,  lots of needless nudity ,  and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex .  i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they're first demo in 1995 .  the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed .  when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder .  i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn't laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars .  the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the  " hardcore goth kids who think death ,  destruction ,  sex ,  blood ,  and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps .  that was really it .  to me this movie seemed like 80 . 5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic .  this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this  " movie "  really is just an extended cradle of filth video .
-1	this movie has a few things going for it right off the bat .  having dani filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie .  admittedly ,  i love cradle of filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before i watched it .  dani filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead .  the independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor .  there are some gorgeous actresses in this movie .  for being low budget ,  the special effects weren't bad either .  the ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish .   now on to the cons .  there is very little talking throughout this whole movie ,  thus making for very little as far as character development .  it's hard to fear for the lives of limp ,  static characters .  when there was a little talking ,  the f bomb was abundant ,  popping up in random places .  yes ,  i understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language .  the storyline ,  what i could make out of it ,  was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening .   in the end ,  cradle of fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence ,  but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline ,  it just doesn't work too well .  rent it though ,  if you're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite .
-1	this movie was made for fans of dani  ( and cradle of filth )  .  i am not one of them .  i think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon  ( still ,  i'm generally not a fan of black metal )  .  but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it ,  i convinced myself ,  that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing .  thus i assumed i'm in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background .  now ,  that is what i do like .   i got home and popped it in .  my patience lasted 15 minutes .  awful camera work and disgusting quality .  and that was then  ( 2002 )  ,  that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder .  i left it on the shelf .  maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this .  .  .  picture .    after a couple of months i got back to it  ( in mentioned surroundings )  and saw half .  then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me .  my disliking evolved .  i noticed how funny dani  ( 1 , 65m ;  5'5 "  height )  looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart .   ( yes ,  ripping .  his head apparently had no skull .  )  i also found that this movie may have no sense .  still ,  i haven't finished it yet ,  so i wasn't positive .   after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back .  .  .   ( yes ,  it took me 5 , 5 years .  )  so - dani in fact was funny as satan/manson/super-evil-man's helper and the movie did not make sense .  see our bad person employs dani to do bad things .  he delivers .  why ?  well i guess he's just very ,  very bad .  as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it .   we have a couple of short stories joined by dani's character .  my favourite was about a guy ,  who steals someone's leg ,  because he wants to use it as his own .  yeah ,  exactly .    the acting's rock bottom .  the cgi is the worst ever .  i mean stinger beats it  ( and ,  boy ,  is stinger's cgi baaaaad )  .  the story has no sense .  and the quality is .  .  .  let's just say it is not satisfying .  the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore .  blood and guts are made pretty well .  why ,  you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on .   ( example - dani 'the man' filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it .  .  .  and then eats what fell out .  why ?  we never know .  we do know ,  however ,  that this cat must have been on illegal substances ,  as his heart is almost half his size .  )   you might think ,  after my comment that this movie is so bad it's good ,  but it's just bad .  cradle of filth fans can add 3 points .  i added one for gore .
-1	this film is a very funny film .  the violence is bad ,  the acting is .  .  . well dani ,  stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do .  the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in .  personally ,  i think this movie really does suck .  the story and characters could be very good ,  if say the directing ,  the actors and other little nibby things were made better .  but the film is just bad ,  the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it .  this film is possibly the worst b-rate film ever .  and ,  believe me that's hard to achieve ,  especially when you're competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for  " serious "  horror movies .  i'm not a cof fan ,  and so i just see this as another rubbish movie .  .  . a really bad one .  if dani made this as a comedy then ,  good going him .  very well done .  over than that though ,  i rate it low ,  for it's crappiness .  watch it when you're in a happy ,  happy ,  joy ,  joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs .
-1	did anyone who was making this movie ,  particularly the director ,  spare a thought for the logic of the story-line ?  these are not mere plot-holes ,  but plot graves ,  that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight .  that is ,  if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave-hole plot ,  or boring and unlikeable .  or ,  in the case of downey's & hannah's characters ,  apparently superfluous .  in pondering the reason for existence of downey's character's significant screen-time in the movie ,  i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen-time  ( unlikley ,  as the director didn't change anything else about the script he actually needed to )  or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting .  i'll leave you to guess which one it was to be .   i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents .  i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job .  surely he has some power to pick and chose .  actually ,  i can't understand why anyone would take this script on ,  except a first-time director looking for the experience .   i suppose robert downey jr .  needed the money for his habit .  i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent .  i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing .  these are the only motivations i can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie .  as for robert altman ,  plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic .  i found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene ,  or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye's movements ,  or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood .  i do not typically notice such things in movies ,  since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story-telling and interesting characters with understandable motives .  i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that ,  due to the talent involved ,  there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie .   nice direction .  but that's not why i watch movies .
-1	.  .  . and you can look at that statement in different ways ,  by the way .  first of all ,  it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes .  your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here .  entire parts of this movie are just plain sick ,  disgusting ,  offensive ,  brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out .  now ,  i love horror movies and i am very 'pro-violence' ,  but i do think that it has to lead somewhere  !  !  is that too much to ask  ?  cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts .  the  " movie "  contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story .  this results in endless showing of torture ,  murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common .  not very informative ,  if you ask me .  and yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely has potential .  it's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial .  personally ,  i think that is an interesting topic ,  so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever .   secondly ,  the whole production of this movie was a mess .  they didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts .  .  . tons of it  !  !  the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i've ever seen .  any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish  (  like that attempt to a realistic car crash ,  for example  )  .  there's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere .  .  . not even an attempt to build up one .   cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least .  with the presence of death-metal icon danni filth  (  from the band cradle of filth .  . get the link  ?   )  this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial .  troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this .  and then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing .  .  . bah .  i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind .  for every self-respecting horror fan ,  this movie is an insult .
-1	cradle of fear  this isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention .  this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack-jacked uttering that sense of whoa .  what it is though is a slice of lo-fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination ,  created in the eyes of the director ,  alex chandon ,  as  " a throwback to sleazy '70s and '80s horror "  .   this is a very visceral experience for 2 hours ,  where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood ,  reams of dismembered body parts and innards ,  tied by an intestinal thread of revenge .    the purveyor of such horrific violence is dani filth ,  lead-singer of the metal band cradle of filth ,  executing a role he was destined to play .    as other's have said ,  there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge .  in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer ,  kemper ,  the father of our devilish avenging-angel ,  compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum .   what this provides for the chandon ,  who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece ,  is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free .  he seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen ,  and into every nook and cranny that can be reached .  we are also treated to close-ups of skull's being crushed ,  demonic rape ,  and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror .  and for some of those who closely follow these type of films ,  there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking ,   " did i just see what i thought i did "  ,  because of course pretty woman this 'aint .  it reminds me of some of the gore-fests created out of italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago ,  and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed .   story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the  " sick room "  ,  where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out .  further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent ,  and an effective use of drum and bass ,  often overlooked in film-making as a viable form of supporting visuals .  using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand-ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film .  ok ,  classic it may not be ,  but blood ,  guts ,  intestines ,  occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is .
-1	this sure is one comedy i'm not likely to forget for a while .   wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie :  it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway ,  but as it happens ,  it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as kazaa ,  and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is .   so what is it then ?  well ,  of course it's not really a comedy ;  instead ,  it's intended as a horror flick --  " intended "  very much being the key word here .  the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess ,  the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic ,  and as for the acting ,  well ,  let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school ,  my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent .   of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations ,  certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned .  also ,  even though i'm a big fan of the horror genre ,  i'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting .   but still .   b-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding ,  such as humour .  the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances .  if you can find the humour in that--and i could for the first 20 minutes or so ,  gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer .  oh ,  that and two or three pairs of breasts .   woohoo ,  how exciting .   as for the story ,  it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything :  the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime .  the lesson :  watch out ,  naughty boys and girls ,  because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done .   i rest my case .   so ,  all in all ,  a little bit of sex ,  a fair amount of drugs ,  but absolutely zero rock 'n roll .   i rate this one 1 out of 10 ,  but would go to 0 if i could .  or perhaps i wouldn't :  it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles .  i mean ,  that's something ,  innit ?
-1	now look ,  i won't lie to you ,  but i only got this movie for $3 . 99 from a friend because it had danni filth ,  the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band  " cradle of filth "  in it .  i expected of course violence and gore at its finest ,  as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as ,  amongst a plot line .   but dear god ,  i was oh so wrong .  this movie seriously bites ,  big time .  being a low budget film  ( haha ,  wait ,  make that zero budget )  ,  this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects .  nope ,  it's all one camera ,  bad angles ,  and bad blood scenes .   take for example when our star and violent fiend ,  mr filth ,  violently kills a mugger .  a grab at the throat ,  and blood spits out ,  but oh my ,  it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt .   to you cradle of filth fans :  you'll hear two songs throughout the movie ,  but with the camera angles and shoddy filming ,  they drag the overall pleasure of the song down .   my final comment :  steer well away from it .  it's blood ,  gore ,  breasts ,  and hey ,  even a shoddy story to go with it .  so if you like appalling violence ,  near no voices  ( yes ,  there's hardly any words in this movie )  ,  then by all means ,  buy it .  but if shoddy movies isn't your thing ,  then avoid it .  don't waste your money .
-1	check out the film's website ,  more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie .  it couldn't be more off in it's boasting .  original story ?  original ?  they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament ,  or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting .  high-end special effects ?  come on ,  i could do better with an atari 7600 and a jug of earwax .  stylish cinematography ?  oh yes ,  the america's funniest home video look is still a classic .  i'm sure they had little money available for this title ,  so of course the sf aren't really that good ,  or a bit bad now and then ,  or just plain hilarious ,  but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money .  4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and done-already's .
-1	i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this .  only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this .  this is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this .  the most cool scene is the car accident ,  with real special effects from the best of hollywood .  avoid this movie at all costs .  see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
-1	this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it .  all aspects of the film - script ,  acting ,  direction - are mediocre .  the acting by the three leads is wooden .  i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work .  lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction .  jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers .  the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen ,  the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange .  the dvd transfer is typical alpha .
-1	this was a disappointing film for me .  it came to me via a boxed set entitled ,   " classic film noir ,  "  which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style  ( i insist that noir is a style ,  not a genre )  .  i do not think it is a noir film at all .  there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir ,  and the label does not always fit .  there is a persecuted male protagonist ,  ed cullen  ( lee j .  cobb )  ,  and most of the film's action takes place indoors .  those are just about the only noir elements that i could see .  there is no pervasive paranoia ,  or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen .  jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale .  i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers .  however ,  i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it .
-1	maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews - and i just don't get it .  i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak ,  look ,  and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura .  none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it .  take the lead actor ,  lee j .  cobb .  his rumpled ,  rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing ,  smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find .  or ,  take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example .  this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while .  she's just not convincing in the role .   as for the plot ,  it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre .  i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes .  and that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull .  ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it .
-1	i watched like 8 or 9 herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me .   i watched several documentaries about him .  he is obviously an intelligent man ,  with great knowledge about films and passion for making them ,  but does this makes him a good director .  definitely no !  a complete anti-talent .  he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits ,  but a film with actors  never !   he can't direct nor write .  his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations ,  and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word  " art "  in any sense .  no way .  not to mention the unskillful direction ,  so amateurish-like .  to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie .   like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store .  who is he kidding ?   he is a cheater ;  he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want .  he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising .  never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction .   just look at julio medem .  if herzog can make a movie like medem can ,  then i might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them .

-1	in spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree gingerbread man crumbles early and often .  the plot is unrealistically convoluted ,  the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check .  once again he has assembled an impressive cast  ( like woody allen ,  everyone wants to work with altman ) that this time around to the letter is miscast .  but that's only part of the problem .   kenneth branagh is rick magruder a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad .  with red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way .  fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale .   branagh plays macgruder with a mealy and unconvincing southern accent .  running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going .  hipster bob downey jr .  is every bit as bad as a p . i .  but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent .  robert duvall as the old man is boo radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible .  the female leads  ( embeth davidtz ,  darryl hannah ,  famkhee jansen ) are lean leggy and unemotive .  even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos  ( vernon jordan )  are wooden with the few throw away lines they have .   in addition to paying little attention to his actors ,  altman's mise en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and shapeless ,  his action scenes comic book .  it lacks his offbeat touches and observations  ( he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia ) that make a well done altman so unique .  unfortunately ,  gingerbread man is altman at his worst ,  even if the pay is the same .
-1	the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life  ( actually it was only 35 minutes )  was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema .  all i have ever seen were few older movies of s . ray .   browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of 8 . 7 i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment .  oh my how wrong i was !  the only logical explanation for this rating of 8 . 7 is that most of 970 people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies .   with this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on imdb list of 250 best movies above citizen cane ,  goodfellas of psycho !  i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience .  my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is -- plain stupid ,  with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .
-1	i love the munna bhai mbbs but  " lagge raho .  .  .  "  sux really sux .  i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life .  and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers  ?  ?    **may be spoiler**   an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai ,  people discussing their personal prob .  on phones come on man from which part of the world u r  ?  ?  ?  i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible .   2 out of 10 .   ( 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting )
-1	let's see where to begin .  .  .  bad acting ;  i'm not sure if i'd even call it that ,  as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read .  the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless .  sure there was a scene or two with nudity ,  but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters .   to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do .  the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants .   budget ?  did this movie even have a budget ?  it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home-shot youtube video .  bad lighting ,  props ,  poor sound post production .  bad special effects ,  if you want to go so far as to call them that .  story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so ,  but there was no life to this flick ;  i don't care who directed it .   i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom .  don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review .  check the ratings ,  you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between .  wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time .  what a suck-fest !
-1	this is a film that makes you say 2 things .  .  .  1 )  i can do much better than this (  acting , writing and directing )  2 )  this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others .  .  .   looks as if it was shot with my flip video .  i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me .  i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video ;  must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film .  one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen .  hopefully the writers and director leave the business .  not even talented enough to do commercials !  !  !  !  !
-1	with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler ,  'the art of seduction' fails to deliver the romantic ,  sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as .  the two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are  " swinging singles  ( or in the female lead's case ,  engaged )  "  ,  but 'the art of seduction' doesn't even try .  shirking from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities ,  'the art of seduction' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin ,  lean stereotype .    'the art of seduction' is insulting - insulting to its characters ,  insulting to men and women ,  and insulting to its audiences' expectations .  it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them .  ji-wan is an immature ,  spoiled ,  manipulative bitch .  the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty .  min-jun ,  well ,  he's exactly the same .  neither are nice people .  the  " humour "  in this film primarily revolve around ji-wan and min-jun's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation .  no character development occurs ,  and we never learn why ji-wan and min-jun are like this .  we are simply expected to take them as they are ,  and not ask questions - they're cute !  ,  and that's all that matters .  the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester's reviews may tip you off to 'art of seduction's shallowness .    if you're still in high school ,  you liked grease ,  or you are a yellow fever victim ,  you may like this movie .   despite its  " romance "  tag ,  this is not a very good date movie .
-1	a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it ,  but after ten minutes of james hetfield's slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think ,  `why am i watching this ? ' that question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit play .  i gave the tape back the same day ,  as you would suspect ,  not worth buying or watching !   just my opinion !
-1	bill  ( buddy rogers )  is sent to new york by his uncle  ( richard tucker )  to experience life before he inherits $25million .  his uncle has paid 3 women jacqui  ( kathryn crawford )  ,  maxine  ( josephine dunn )  and pauline  ( carole lombard )  to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers .  one such lady cleo  ( geneva mitchell )  turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women .  we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york ,  while bill meets with cleo and another woman .  at the end ,  love is in the air for bill and one other  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film .  the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice .  rogers isn't that good either .  he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone .  there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver  ( roscoe karns )  and the film is just dull .
-1	i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel .  .  . so invariably my expectations were crushed .  but they were crushed more than should be expected .  the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand ,  which perhaps ruined it for me .   in any event ,  for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves .  the scene at bishop myriel's was fine .  in fact ,  other than the galleys ,  things survived up until the dismissal of fantine .  because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman ,  she does not cut her hair ,  sell her teeth ,  or become a prostitute .  the worst she does is run into the mayor's office and spit on his face .  bamatabois is entirely eliminated .  because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about ,  tholomyes is fantine's dead husband ,  rather than an irresponsible dandy .  valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair ,  so they reunite happily ,  yet another change .  then comes the convent ,  which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up .  thankfully ,  it was saved .  after this three minutes of accuracy ,  however ,  the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering .   as cosette and valjean are riding through the park ,  they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting .  about prison reform .  when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette ,  he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set .   " we aren't revolutionaries .  "  i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave .  of course they are revolutionaries !  they want to revolt against the pseudo-monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic ,  you dumb screenwriters !  it's a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 .    at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine .  except .  .  . not eponine .  or at least not the eponine of the book .  this eponine appears to be a well-to-do secretary girl working for the prison reformers  ( who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain )  .  not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not-period ,  low-cut ,  tight-fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms .   the prison reformers  ( lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen )  decide that handing out pamphlets isn't good enough anymore .  so they're going to build barricades .  i don't know about you ,  but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops .  about three hundred people  ( it was not supposed to be so many )  start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades ,  etc .  eponine does die for marius ,  thankfully .    the rest of the movie is sort of accurate ,  except that javert's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation .  the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river .  this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown .  he saved the man's life earlier ,  why let him die now ?  then there's the whole skipping of valjean's confession to marius ,  his deterioration ,  and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side .   overall ,  i can blame the script mostly for the problems .  while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film ,  they were terribly misinterpreted ,  as was the entire barricade scene .  the elimination of fantine's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her .  that cosette knows valjean's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal .  i did not even see thenardier ,  and mme .  thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time .  the same with gavroche .  i did like frederich march's interpretation of valjean a lot ,  however ,  which was one of the redeeming features of the movie .  on the other hand ,  charles laughton ,  for all his great acting in other movies ,  seems to have missed the mark with javert .  the lip tremble ,  the unnecessary shouting ,  and his acting in general all just felt very wrong .  he also ,  like many javerts i have seen ,  did not appear at all menacing ,  something required of the character .   again ,  this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book .  i would not recommend it to book purists ,  though .  i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before .
-1	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .  while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations .  the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music ,  which pretty much sums up the movie :  compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors ,  loud and dramatic music .  it doesn't change the fact ,  that this is a very boring movie to watch .  earned itself a score of 1 .
-1	here's an indie film i really wanted to like ,  but ultimately could not .  the lack of script  ( boldly proclaimed in the main titles )  really shows through and kills the picture .  the story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out .  i quickly became bored within 10 minutes ,  then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to  ( mercifully )  get to the end .  .  .  even that wasn't worth the extra effort .  ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever ,  lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix .  as a result ,  there's very little in ozark savage that hasn't been done before ,  and better .  this film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short ,  but as a feature ,  it just feels padded and forced .  of course ,  there's no money in shorts ,  so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75+ minutes .  director matt steinauer shows great promise ,  and i wish him luck .
-1	many people thought that this is a good movie but i don't agree with them .  at the beginning of the movie ,  a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship ,  then hey killed some people on the earth ,  but for no reason .  also ,  it is in a dark forest ,  i can't see anything on the screen ,  i can only hardly hear the sound .   after a few days ,  the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that ,  he should not know what happened on the earth ,  so there is a contradiction .  finally ,  the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason .  he was not live on earth ,  t is none of his business about the things happened here .  lastly ,  the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long ,  the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly .   in conclusion ,  i don't think this is a good movie .
-1	i just finished a marathon of this series ,  and it became agonising to watch as it progressed .  from the fictionalising of the historical elements ,  to o'herlihy's awful accent in later episodes ,  the show just slumps the further it goes .  if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww2 fluff ,  then i could recommend season 1 ,  but avoid anything after that ,  it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera ,  with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility .   the old b&w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it ,  and even that is not what one could hope for .
-1	saw this 'film' recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see .  what the hell was going on with coolio ?  totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress .  totally uninvolving ,  slow ,  tedious and detached .  worse than spawn .  long live  " evil dead ii "  .
-1	what the hell of a d-movie was that ?  bad acting ,  bad special effects and the worst dialogues/storyline i ever came across .  the only cool thing here was coolio ,  who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop .  however ,  the rest of the film is awful and boring .  it's not even so bad ,  you can laugh about it .  just plain crap .  and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones  ( well ,  ok ,  at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider )  !  1 out of 10
-1	this movie is bad !  it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video ,  only worse !  the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint ,  freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling .  i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie .
-1	this film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice  " demons "  and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching .  the acting is terrible , the action scenes are speeded up , the script is almost painful and budget non existent .   if you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film ,  skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .
-1	lame ,  lame ,  lame !  !  !  a 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long .  a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility  ( an abandoned convent )  is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky ,  witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip .  mostly it's just embarrassing ,  and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat  ( a sample of this movie's dialogue :  after demonstrating her artillery ,  fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante charactershe :  `any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck )  .  bad acting ,  idiotic ,  homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects ,  it looks like the director's watched `the evil dead' way too many times .    i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back .  what a turd .
-1	this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen ,  and i have quite an appetite for awful  ( and good )  movies .  it could  ( just )  have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek --à la rocky horror picture show ,  which was really very funny .  other movies ,  like plan nine from outer space ,  manage to be funny while  ( apparently )  trying to be serious .  as to the acting ,  it looks like they rounded up brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production .  compared to them ,  tom cruise looks like alec guinness .  there was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul-busting broad on the motorcycle .
-1	my friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out ,  so when she brought home the convent ,  a horror movie ,  i couldn't wait to watch it .  given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious ,  i can say that in some weird way ,  i like this movie .    yes ,  the acting is bad ,  and yes ,  it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen ,  but it's so damn funny !   " what ,  are you smoking ca-rack ?  !  "  i didn't know this movie even was ever released .  .  .  i figured it was too bad .  .  .    yeah ,  so .  .  .  overall the movie is pretty bad  ( you gotta admit that much at least )  but i promise you ,  you will get a good laugh out of it .   *this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh .  .  .  especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair' .  .  the dagger of despaaaaaair !
-1	rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent .  there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film .  what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings .  actors of stature - robert duvall ,  robert downey ,  jr .  - are deployed in roles which go nowhere ;  a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens ;  a writer  ( john grisham )  who has never produced anything of merit ,  discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence .  the film has a cheap ,  lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic .  normally ,  i come on to the imdb to write balanced ,  generally appreciative comments .  this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless ,  bilious rant .  i won't ,  but only because i no longer want to occupy my  " mind "  with this trash .
-1	this movie is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen .  from the very first scene ,  i knew it would be a smash crash .  it starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission .  as it turns out ,  the people in it were possessed by some random zombies .  well ,  some years later ,  some college kids are pulling some pledge prank .  horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock .  things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non-chalonte manner ,  with pledge over reacting and over-doing the whole  " eager to be popular role "  what really took the cake with this one is the final battle .  absolutely horrible special effects with the guns .  for example ,  guns making a noise with no muzzle flash ,  and vice-versa .  this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies  ( why they move in stop motion is a mystery )  ,  cheesy music ,  and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere .   overall ,  this movie is crap .  just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .
-1	this film wasn't programmed in italian cinemas , i have seen it at a manifestation called  " fantafestival "  . i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark ,  the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there's no suspence in the film .  music is completely out of the story and i don't have words to describe the visual effects . if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting ,  but a few minutes later it becomes busy . the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .
-1	in fact ,  these young people were so distasteful that i couldn't wait for all of 'em to get slaughtered ,  and that includes clarissa  ( joanna canton )  since i considered her the most annoying of the bunch .   but i knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the leslie gore music playing in the background .  it had nowhere to go but down .   even the prosthetics looked fake and the  " blood "  looked suspiciously like hawaiian punch ,  although later on it took on red day-glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing .  i'm sure all the goth morons out there will appreciate this bullsh-t since it'll appeal to that bunch .  it sure didn't appeal to me .  blah .  .  .   and not even my favorite horror babe adrienne barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself .  she still looks hot ,  though .  i'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays .   however ,  it is a step up from dante tomaselli's meandering horror  ( 2002 )  in that it has a somewhat coherent plot ,  so i'll give it that much .  that and the little boston terrier named boozer also brings it up a notch .  i like what boozer does to clarissa in the end .  it was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film .   lion's gate films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up .   2 out of 10
-1	when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby ,  the first thing they say is  " what do you think of such-and-such movie ?  "  there are a couple of problems here .  firstly ,  there is the probable chance that i've not seen it and thus ,  i ruin my reputation .  secondly ,  i could trash the movie in question without realising that it's actually their favourite .  lastly ,  i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion .  thus ,  i find myself sat before  " the convent "  which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here .  more's the pity because this frankly dreadful  " horror "  is about as scary as a box of kittens .   following well-worn clichés ,   " the convent "  focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned ,  laid and mildly spooked .  but you'll never guess what happens next ?  a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition .  will any of them survive and more importantly ,  haven't you got better things to worry about ?    the only thing that saves  " the convent "  from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio's bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger .  it's far too amusing to be properly frightening - the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason ,  the day-glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie - but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered .  but even if they were trying ,  i still doubt that it would work - demonic nuns wearing the sort of make-up you'd see in the  " buffy the vampire slayer "  tv show aren't really that scary .  the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10% of voters gave this a maximum score .  i mean ,  i know it's funny but i hardly split my sides .  to be honest ,  i've had more fun in a dentist .    " the convent "  isn't really a horror movie as such .  it's more of a comedy horror like  " scary movie "  or  " shaun of the dead "  but you're laughing at it instead of with it .  i honestly can't recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then ,  i doubt very much they'd enjoy it .  i don't enjoy the  " so bad that it's good "  genre - i personally feel that if the film-makers can't be bothered to salvage a turkey then i shouldn't bust a gut trying to watch it .  yes ,  it's a bad film and yes ,  they really should have gone home and done something more constructive .  a rubik's cube ,  for example .  the dvd box has two price stickers - one for £4 . 99 and a reduced price of £3 .  but it was sold for £1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy ,  cheap ,  awesomely bad flick .  sorry if you do like it but  " the convent "  really is a pile of unholy crap .
-1	i just watched the convent for the second time .  i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film ,  some gore ,  some style ,  bit of humour and suchlike .  i was saddened to find that i could no longer appreciate it much .  it seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile .  for the record i'm not even a huge fan of night of the demons ,  but there were some things i really dug about it .  the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much .  apart from the main girl  ( likeable performance from joanna canton )  ,  the goth girl and a sweet cameo from adrienne barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable ,  festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic ,  offensive jockhood .  the film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that ,  given the awful dialogue ,  it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film .  the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes ,  though not scary their certainly kinda cool ,  and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore .  towards the end ,  when adrienne barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy .  the stylised direction also occasionally yields good results ,  although sometimes the camera just moves too fast .  all in all ,  this was a film where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things i hated .  those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more ,  but for me it wasn't a good time .
-1	.  .  .  .  .  . this film is pretty awful ,  the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse .   the jungle music ,  juttering demons ,  and fluorescent uv style blood/teeth/eyes give it that  " awful "  look ,  and the script is dire .  .  .  .  . this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it .  it's also predictable but not in a good way .  nothing this film does is in a good way .  i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are .   ( oh and the acting doesn't let the film down ,  it's also terrible )
-1	this film is absolutely horrific .  one of the worst movies i've ever seen .  the story does nearly not exist ,  the characters are full of stereotypes and the special-fx only make you laugh .  the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police officer .   if this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn't quite get the point .  if you want to watch this movie :  please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs .  .  . especially when the first special-fx appear on the screen .   but if you like trash movies made on the cheap :  this film is a must-see for you .
-1	worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon .  i suppose that this is a horror/comedy .  i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie .  the special-effects were not so special .  i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house .  i wish i could have something good to say about this movie ,  but i am afraid that i don't .  even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey .  i do ,  after a little thought ,  have one thing good to say about this movie - it ended .
-1	i thought that this movie was pretty lame .  if you're looking for cheesey ,  you may like this .  i ,  myself ,  don't mind a fair amount of cheese ,  but this was ridiculous .  the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak .   the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day-glo zombies ,  but even that isn't reason enough to see this flick .
-1	i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great ,  so i went out and bought it .  what a mistake ,  the acting is a shambles ,  the special effects  ( if you could call them that )  ,  look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school play .  some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen ,  which unfortunately is all to often .  as for a story ,  forget it .  this is a warning ,  don't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen .  if ,  for some reason ,  you like this film watch troll 2 ,  you will probably enjoy that as well .
-1	what's up with robert  " pretentious "  altman ?  was he saving on lighting ?  everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable .  i mean ,  have you ever seen a lawyer's office where everyone works by candlelight ?   don't waste your time .  in fact ,  don't waste your time with anything altman makes :  it's all a pretentious waste of film .
-1	this movie is awful !  i don't even know where to begin ,  i'm speechless i can't even describe how awful this is .  the blood is flourescent first of all ,  and the acting is awful !  the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day .  this movie was rediculous ,  i don't see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad .  it looks like it was made by highschool students .
-1	this is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be .  i dread to think what the blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like ,  because the director's cut on dvd was a bore of the epic proportions .  naturally ,  you don't expect it to be  " the godfather "  ,  but an acting class or two might have come in handy .   also ,  there were so many cute guys in this movie ,  but they were woefully under-exploited .  i like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their bvds as much as the next guy ,  but even i have a right to expect a little more .  it wasn't a total loss ,  though ;  at least we got a peek a drew fuller's  ( covered )  junk and truly upsetting haircut .  and there's huntley ritter looking even cuter than he did in  " bring it on "   ( and acting about as well )  .  there's always a silver lining ,  kids .  you just have to look really hard for it .  and occasionally ,  you have to make use of your pause button .
-1	" voodoo academy "  features an  " academy "  like no other ,  one that houses only six male students in one bedroom .  these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest ,  who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously .  the sole administrator of this  " academy "  is a young and seductive headmistress ,  and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash ,  so to speak .   sexual overtones abound ,  and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies .  these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the  " academy ,  "  and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie .  if you're not interested in the male form -- stay away !   burdened by weak and awkward dialogue ,  this low-budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns .  the mood is claustrophobic ,  with tediously long takes ,  a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes .  these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue ,  intended as character and plot development .  it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days .  .  .
-1	i have seen a lot of bad films .  most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is .  but this really takes badness to new extremes .   it is bland ,  the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it .  there are no shocks ,  no horror ,  no suspense ,  just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish .   a blight on the crappy horror genre ,  avoid at all costs .
-1	i know you've read that before ,  on countless other films no doubt if you're reading the comments here ,  but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i've been able to track down .  no doubt the really bad ones aren't even available to buy or watch on tv ,  but even so i feel it's fair to qualify that i'm not just some dumb renter who picked badly .   i've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb ,  and i'm ticking of the remaining ones with every chance .  most of those stand head and shoulders above this .  .  .  excersize in absolute monotony .   i like to rate truly bad films  ( as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are )  by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through .  if you can watch it by yourself ,  it isn't that bad .  if you can watch it with one single friend .  .  .  it's bad but could be a lot worse .   it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy .  and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films  ( spotting the boom mic for example ,  3 times in this one if i'm not mistaken )  could take away the dry taste in my mouth .  yes i'd watched it ,  but i'd also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end .   i hope and pray we saw the directors cut .  .  .  to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me .  so much of the film centers around this .   i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget ,  just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes .  but it isn't a good film .  the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money  ( considering inflation )  and was an utter gem .  it's not an excuse for how bad this baby is .   spoilers ahead .  .  .   it's not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters .  .  .  the pacing of the film .  .  .  is insane .  .  .  nothing .  .  .  is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging .  no matter what your alignment or sex .  .  .  rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time .   the acting is cheese .  .  .  but not overly amatuer .  .  .  i've seen a lot worse in better films .  .  .  but somehow it's the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a film ,  that really grates .   rent this if ,  like me ,  you have a fascination with the worst of the worst ,  and only if you're going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it .  this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair .  it's an endurance test you probably want to skip .   i'm sure there is worse .  .  .  but i wouldn't be surprised if it has decoteau's name on it .
-1	this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life !  !  it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous !  !  and i have never seen such bad acting in my life !  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys ( especially drew fuller )  .  i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie !  !  i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves .  i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn !  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch !  i was very disappointed !  !  the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion .
-1	if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one .  a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind .  which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action .  a few of the actors i've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better .  all the special effects are done by the great  " rondo "  whom performs all the magic whit his mind .  a cult movie is written on the box .  does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all ?  ?  ?   get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving .
-1	cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting .  not a single good line ,  not even a line bad enough to be good ,  and no memorable delivery .  even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having .  the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic ,  and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable .  the 'homoerotic' overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying ,  and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers .  i'm not gay enough to appreciate it ,  but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake .
-1	you can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days ,  and i had expected it to be campy anyway .   ( it's not all that campy in reality .  with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter ,  who don't take themselves seriously ,  the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight ;  riley smith is exceptionally bad .  )  the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to ,  which kind of shocked me ;  i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story ,  but they use lots of words like  " technological "  and  " physicality "  in the script to get their point across .   ( although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members .  )  nobody cares about this stupid storyline ,  and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms  ( which aren't all that edgy )  .  i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason .  the film is grainy ,  with a tv-quality look and acting level .  there are a few  " sexy "  scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers ,  feeling themselves up ;  or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny .  and i liked the digs at l .  ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones ,  but it still isn't any good .  3/10
-1	and a few more  " no " s on top of that .  voodoo academy is ,  without a doubt ,  the least ambitious film of all time .  what exactly is it trying to do ?  tell a story ?  obviously not ;  as has been pointed out ,  most of it's just barely-legal guys rubbing themselves .  could it ,  then ,  be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism ?  well ,  maybe ,  if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact .   ( which is ,  to the delight of none ,  repeated about eighty thousand times .  )  well ,  it is sort of a horror movie ;  is it trying to scare us ?  not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his  " work .  "   never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less .  this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i've ever seen .  it's like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror ,  zombie ,  and gay movies ,  puts them in a grinder ,  then runs them through a coffee filter--only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans ,  it's the kind that takes out everything vital ,  edgy ,  or in any way interesting .  the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water--only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10-day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort .
-1	this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care .  90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever ,  i laughed so much my ribs began to ache .  the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous .  on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character .  this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes .  seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker' .
-1	i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self .  i don't wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny .  what is wrong with these people .  i'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat .  i watched this film in disbelief .  who would pay money to make this ?  ?  this film is so bad that its painful .  most bad films are funny because they are crap .  the animal is just disgusting !  !  !  watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self .  we don't need you .  i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies .  if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize .
-1	rob schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements ,  facials and performances of  " not humans "  .  this time he is the animal .  marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day ,  nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked ,  so marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man .  but on his way to the crime scene ,  he crashes with his car and gets really damaged .  he doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day ,  his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts .  of course ,  we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings ,  are useless .  she is played by collen haskell .  there are no negative characters .  the negative character ,  is destiny if i could use this metaphor .  marvin should find out ,  how to become a normal human being again .  by the way-his animal instincts ,  helps him in some situations .  schneider's performance is a so-so .  the movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies ,  called mindless fun as i have written above .  so watch it for the monkey style rob schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that schneider appears in .  he is a great comedian but this is not his best movie .
-1	i hired this movie expecting a few laughs ,  hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken .  this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it .  .  .  aimed at an age group of 10-15 ,  this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied .  worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives .
-1	guy is a loser .  can't get girls ,  needs to build up ,  is picked on by stronger more successful guys ,  etc .  seen it ,  saw it ,  moved on .  i'd have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life .  and get out of the adam sandler plots .  there are two funny parts in the whole movie .  i couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes .  i was getting bored .   " the animal "  is an alright film .  i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot .  but this was trying too hard to impress .  the jokes are very old .  so ,  trust me .  this is not a film that most people could really get into .  but some did ,  so i'll be nice .   3/10
-1	redundant ,  but again the case .  if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics  ( in this case ,  schneider )  ,  then you should go .  basic comedy . man's life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him .  unfortunately ,  he takes on each animal's characteristics .  former survivor colleen looks pretty good here ,  now that she doesn't have open sores on her legs ,  and a little makeup on her face !  d
-1	i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow ,  which i enjoyed .  however ,  this dud seemed to last forever .  it's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg-13 while not being kid appropriate .  the jokes aren't just low-brow or f**t jokes ,  they're crude ,  lewd ,  and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency .  many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg-13 rating .  .  . too bad .  .  . it might have made a bigger splash as an r-rated film if the funny was left in .   ( overstatement ?  probably .  )  i do not recommend this movie .  it is a full-on waste of time .  .  . and i'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot .  at 45 minutes in ,  the movie felt like it should be winding down .  .  . and boy were we ready for it to .  the ending is quaint but doesn't salvage the rest of this quagmire/tourist trap of a rental .  1/2 star  ( glad i saw it as a freebie .  .  . would have been sickened to pay hard-earned greenbacks for this tripe )
-1	nothing in this movie is funny .  i thought the premise ,  giving a human the libido of a randy ram ,  was interesting and should provide for some laughs .  wrong !  there is simply nothing funny about the movie .  for example ,  the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny ,  it borders on obscenity .  they are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level ,  and it just aint funny .   we all know that dogs will eat anything ,  anywhere ,  anytime .  the main character doing this with everything ,  everywhere ,  everytime is also not funny .  it becomes a cliche .   rob schneider is ,  i guess ,  acceptable in the role .  by this ,  i mean that he's not a bad actor ,  but with rotten material it's difficult to comment on quality .  however ,  coleen haskell ,  the other half of the human-romantic leads  ( does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too ?  )  ,  seems embarrassed by the whole thing ,  as well she should be .  she seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum ,  detached from all the other actors in the movie .    see this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless ,  dull ,  repetitive material .
-1	this is a very bad movie .  i laughed once or twice ,  and the storyline sucks !  there is maybe one funny joke ,  it is stupid and it is boring .  through the whole short movie ,  i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end .   no one acts human ,  and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous .  rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see .  it looked funny ,  but the bottom line :  don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie .   i was wondering when it was going to end ,  even though it is a short movie .  in the beginning we thought it would get better ;  but it gets worse .  stupid ,  all the way to the end .  i walked out of the theater ,  and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever .   the writer and co-producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer ,  but this is nothing like the simpsons  ( this movie sucks !  !  !  )
-1	i saw an interview with rob schneider  ( who plays the lead character ,  marvin mange ,  in this film .  )  he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you'd be laughing at this movie .  obviously that must be the secret .  i had the volume turned up .  i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster ,  and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after schneider's hilarious performance in  " deuce bigalow ,  male gigolo .  "   the story is stupid :  mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr .  wilder  ( michael caton )  ,  and as a result starts to lose control of his  " animal instincts .  "  this makes him a  " supercop .  "  he can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses .  of course ,  he also has a nasty habit of eating people's cows and trying to seduce their goats ,  but surely that's a small price to pay ?  it just didn't do anything for me .    the cast left much to be desired .  is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley ?  here ,  he plays sgt .  sisk ,  mange's commander on the police force ,  as a repugnantly cartoonish character  ( much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series  " scrubs .  "  )  i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell's first  " serious "  acting job  ( can anything in this movie be called  " serious ?  "  )  she ,  of course ,  gained her fame as a contestant on the first  " survivor "  and she proves here what we knew from that :  she's cute as a button .  what she doesn't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress .  and what's with ed asner as police chief wilson .  i mean ,  how old is this guy now ?  he's the size of some of the cows mange tried to eat ,  and he seemed out of breath the whole way through .  i'm surprised he made it through the filming .  there's a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler  ( who also served as executive producer of this .  )   anyway ,  i chuckled twice :  mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car ,  and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more acting talent !  so ,  for two chuckles - 2/10 .
-1	i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly .  it is not even funny .  any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it .  in the first half hour ,  rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk .  all i could think was  " he deserves it ,  for making such a bad movie "  .  don't waste your time or money on this one .
-1	i didn't really like this movie that much at all .  it wasn't really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid .  rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this ,  it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in .  i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it .  the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and i'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found .  all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie !   final query :   theaters :  so glad i didn't squander too much money on this .   dvd purchase :  ummm ,  let me think .  .  .  . no !   rental :  if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not .
-1	dreary .  schlocky .  just plain dreadful and awful .  let's be honest ,  when you sit down to watch something called the double-d avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment .  you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts .  you don't get really either of these in the video .  the story ,  as it consistent with most of these types ,  is inane :  kitten natividad runs a local pub ,  finds out she has breast cancer ,  flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver ,  returns and fights ,  dressed as the double-d avenger ,  a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition .  as stories go ,  i have seen a lot worse ,  but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous .  the action sequences lack zip ,  drive ,  motivation ,  and are tissue thin .  the acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits .  nothing ,  and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references .  all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it ,  but they all fall way short .  kitten ,  haji ,  and raven de la croix are all quite older ( still lovely in their own ways )  yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be :  older ,  campy caricatures of their former selves .  instead ,  they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are  " starring "  in rather than their own abilities .  there are some other lovely ladies ,  but you really do not see much of anything .  pg -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this .  the material ,  the actresses ,  and director are all tired ,  tiresome ,  and dated - and again - not funny !  it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this ,  and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun .  the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me .  not that he was good at all mind you ,  but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was .  the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr .  sci-fi himself ,  forrest j .  ackerman ,  play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie .  other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired ,  dreadful ,  trite pun !
-1	marvin ( rob schneider ) does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream .  but his luck changes when he has a car crush ( a very bad one ) and is found by a doctor .  the doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him .  after this moment ,  he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be .  by the time ,  he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side .  in the mean time ,  he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised .  i am not a big fun of rob schneider .  in fact ,  this is the his first film i have seen .  however ,  i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser .  ( see his part in ally mcbeal ,  quite funny actually )  . there are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat .  in such movies ,  the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent .  i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously .  but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office .  the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than * .
-1	ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him ,  turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way ?  that formula never gets old ,  does it ?  it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film !  just look at major hits like liar liar and big !  .  .  .  this must have been rob schneider's line of thinking when he made semi-successful deuce bigalow :  male gigolo and followed it with the animal .  since i've already traced the plot through sarcasm ,  allow me to color it in more :  schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery .  .  .  by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts ,  causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times ,  run like a cheetah ,  etc .  this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider-starring flicks  ( such as another lame same-plot follow-up the hot chick )  ,  but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead  ( colleen haskell from  " survivor "  )  and inserting a cameo by norm macdonald .  my favorite scene .  .  .  just does not exist .  sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value .  i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay ,  but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way  (  " you can do it !  "  )  ,  there's a word for that -  " milking .  "  actually ,  here's another word -  " cheap .  "
-1	i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war ,  avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles .  zvezda barely does the first .  zvezda being a russian war film ,  i was expecting patriotism ,  sentimentality ,  beautiful poetic pictures ,  a lush score ,  slavic cheekbones and cruel germans .  what i didn't need was the naive love non-affair ,  the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references  ( stalinism ,  nazism ,  holocaust )  only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about  " liberating poland "  .  a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently .
-1	for domestic audiences i can see how they would applaud this movie .  for outsiders ,  with no vested interests ,  it did not make much sense .  the germans were portrayed as incompetents and the russians as heroes .  the supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction .  how a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense .  how she could ,  as mentioned at the end of the movie ,  never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me .  i mentioned the germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh .  several hundred german troops advanced ,  pushing the russians into the marsh .  so the russians hid and the germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening .  i suppose they did not want to get their boots wet ,  but i am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh .  but that would have ended the story .  also ,  the germans entered the barn where the russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof .  at the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in .   i did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end .  i wonder why ?  you knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart-tugging in that .
-1	i'm a fan of columbo ,  especially on a rainy saturday ,  and it was fun to see oskar werner after fahrenheit 451 ,  but this episode was very lacking .  the original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance ,  even years before the modern detective shows of today .  but it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and  " modern "  electronics equipment and ,  of course ,  the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale .  the high-tech home is a jetson's or disney version of tomorrowland ,  and fun to think of writers inventing those  " way-out gizmos "  .   if its sunny outside ,  go play ,  as there are much better columbo episodes .  still ,  we should be thankful for cable tv that these episodes are being broadcast .
-1	manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa ,  parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjs  this movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe  the british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid   the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life ,  the masks of amitabh haha and more  direction by manmohan desai is bad music is okay  amitabh does his part with style ,  nothing different from coolie ,  laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual ,  nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual
-1	bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan's mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated .  manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag , parvarish , amar akbar anthony , naseeb , desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed .  my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2 , maybe mr desai ran out of ideas ,  after all he had been using that formula for years and years .  1 .  first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa ,  for instance the police inspector who brings up amar ,  the muslim who brings up akbar ,  nirupa roy and a few more .  2 .  in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight ,  in mard she loses her voice 3 .  in aaa there is the famous song  ( shirdi wale sai baba ) well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali .  having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away .   my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous ,  true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far .  my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing .  i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didn't like it one bit .  it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child .
-1	this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen .   i have to disagree with another commenter ,  who said the special effects were okay .  i found them pretty bad :  it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story .   maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story .  the archaeologists are looking for  " the set "  .  they do not bother to tell what set ,  or what is so special about it .  that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california ,  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt .   if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert ,  take the effort to actually go to the desert .  the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert .   the action-level was constant throughout the movie ,  no ups and downs ,  no climax .  it made the movie look short ,  and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie .
-1	i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently ,  and the sci-fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find .  as such ,  i'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion .  the acting was uncharacteristically sub-par ,  as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci-fi usually has in store for us .  there are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize ,  although you may not know their names by heart .  the cgi special effects are minimal ,  and as such ,  one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci-fi feature is lacking .  sure ,  there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer ,  or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days ,  but overall ,  it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter ,  and i consider that a major disappointment .   if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made-for tv movies ,  i'd probably give it a 4 ,  maybe even a 5 .  a real shame that i may have to wait 'till the next sci-fi original movie to get a good laugh ,  and i really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci-fi original movies .
-1	worse than the rating it has been given .  this is a typical scifi movie nowadays :  bad to awful acting ,  a script that is poorly written ,  and shoddy direction .  from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end ,  this movie is terrible .  in the beginning scenes this movie has moses  ( which was charlton heston in the demille film )  ,  pharoah  ( yul brynner )  and nefretiri  ( anne baxtor )  overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand .  the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to  " supposedly "  be .  the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance .  the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert .  i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality .
-1	well ,  i suppose the good news concerning william winckler's 2001 opus ,   " the double-d avenger ,  "  is that it manages to unite three of russ meyer's mammarian marvels--kitten natividad ,  haji and raven de la croix--in one picture .   ( i can only assume that lorna maitland ,  tura satana and babette bardot were busy the week they shot this thing .  .  . or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance !  )  the bad news ,  though  ( and there's plenty of it )  ,  is that this film--if it can even be called that ,  having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire ,  a total abortion ,  an out-and-out atrocity ,  an absolute abomination ,  and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen .  look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made !  the plot here ,  such as it is ,  deals with kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in south america to cure her breast cancer  ( oy )  ,  and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in l . a .  too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely  ( you should pardon the expression )  flat ,  that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all  ( other than some old photos of kitten in her heyday )  ,  and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special fx .  the meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest ,  to put it kindly ,  although sheri dawn thomas ,  as bikini girl ooga boobies  (  !  )  ,  does manage to ,  uh ,  stand out nicely .  so why have i given this juvenile ,  unfunny ,  failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 ?  to be succinct :  joe bob briggs .  his voice-over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious ,  especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word  " breast "  from the 1 , 000+ on his web site's  " canonical hooters list .  "  the man is a national treasure ,  and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status !
-1	tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the 20's during the filming of demille's first version of the 10 commandments and which is reawakened when demille's sets are unearthed in the desert .   one of the worst films i've seen in a long time .   the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film ?  if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness .  if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons . you will laugh long and hard at this film ,  probably more than many other hollywood  " comedies "  .
-1	watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes .  it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy .  the setup was promising ,  in the 1920's cecil b .  demille makes his opus of the ten commandments .  it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil  ( don't they always ?  )  .  aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down .  hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time .  then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site  ( the movie's first mistake ,  but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci-fi channel movie )  .  the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect .  then the body counts starts .  this is were the movie went south for me .  the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction .  once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do ?  they make the usual stop to the  " guy who knows the truth but never told anyone "  .  after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site ?  no ,  they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk .  really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem .  after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way ,  by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades .  for a sci-fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out ,  which isn't saying much at all .  what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it .
-1	i'm at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this  " poppycock "  of a movie .  they had a pretty interesting idea ,  with the buried movie set ,  and that was it .  so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story .  there is the buried set ,  some wolf headed monster running amok ,  an amulet ,  and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is .  what i would have missed ,  had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase ,  some really bad c . g . i .  ,  some incredibly stupid dialog ,  more bad c . g . i .  ,  and the hero fighting paper cut outs .  other than the original idea ,  this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities .  my mistake for continuing to watch .  - merk
-1	while the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies ,  the execution is ,  as usual lacking .  while the practical mummy effects are not bad ,  and the  " gun nut "  character is over the top giggle inducing ,  the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen .  i suspect that was the idea all along .  they do the best they can with what they have but the  " must see "  moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when morena's character sported some tomb raider style shorts .  not high brow cinema i know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it !  !  !  and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate .  if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you .  if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere .
-1	reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high :  a big budget ,  tons of popular faces ,  a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves .  the end result is a disaster .  alice tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience  ( i didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation )  ,  going through it's page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark ,  not a sign of the magic it wished it had .  the 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set ,  let alone on paper .  'l'odyssée d'alice tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches ,  linked together with a  ( very )  thin layer of good ideas .  avoid or boredom will haunt you .
-1	just saw this movie ,  and what a waste of time .  the movie was predictable and slow .  it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball .  rather than watching this movie ,  i should have had a root canal .  the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding .  this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball ,  however because it's rated pg ,  the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film .  the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard .  thurl bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary .
-1	this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet .  it made the rm & sons of provo look like well done films !  it was supposed to be funny from what i was told .  the best part was the best actor in the movie-travis eberhard-if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made !  he ruled !   10 .  it wasn't funny 9 .  it was beat 8 .  it had thurl big t bailey ,  who's character made no sense 7 .  it was made in provo 6 .  it didn't make fun of brokeback 5 .  it had larry h .  miller in it 4 .  it was the 1st movie clint howard wasn't funny in 3 .  gary coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 .  they should have cast at surreal life auditions 1 .  it was made by halestorm entertainment !  !
-1	i think i will make a movie next weekend .  oh wait ,  i'm working .  . oh i'm sure i can fit it in .  it looks like whoever made this film fit it in .  i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked !  !  !  it looks like someones home movie and i don't think more than $100 was spent making it !  !  !  total crap !  !  !  who let's this stuff be released ?  !  ?  !  ?  !
-1	this movie is a total dog .  i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time .  the writing in this film is absolutely terrible .  it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies .   they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right .  even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role .   this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots .  after viewing this movie ,  i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor ,  where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery .  unfortunately ,  this movie fails to deliver the lines ,  the characters ,  the delivery or the humor .  i should have gone to the dentist instead !
-1	i went to see this film with fairly low expectations ,  figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff .  sadly ,  it wasn't even that .  i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out .  i went with my two kids  ( ages 10 and 13 )  and even they kept asking ,   " how much longer ?  "  after lasting until the end ,  i just kept wondering who would approve this script .  even the reliable fred willard couldn't save the trite dialogue ,  the state jokes ,  and the banal plot .  i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie  ( i use the term loosely )  should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class .  at the least ,  there are many books on directing ,  screen writing ,  and producing movies that would teach them something about structure ,  plot ,  dialogue and pacing .
-1	the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget  " halestorm entertainment "  has had to work with .  all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash .  not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful ,  but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best .  the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc .  the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing .  i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the  " film "  .
-1	kitten natividad ,  of russ meyer film fame ,  plays chastity knott ,  a woman who has found she has breast cancer ,  so she goes to south america to get some special fruit  ( crockazilla ?  )  that is supposed to have healing powers .  after going down on some of this fruit  ( which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks )  chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero ,  specifically ,  the double d avenger .  note that she's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask .  in writing ,  that all sounds pretty good .  in execution ,  well ,  it leaves more than a little to be desired .  it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she's taking away their business so some of the strippers  ( including haji ,  also of russ meyer film fame )  go after her to ruin her .  of course ,  chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger .  watch her do a  " wonder woman "  type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force .  bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow .  with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70's  " live action "  kid's show with adult content ,  although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg-13 at the worst .  and it's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered .  this makes doris wishman's chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison .  special appearance by forest j .  ackerman but so what .  very stupid ,  and i'm never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover .  2 out of 10 .
-1	trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout mormons ,  and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film .  finally kurt hale's fortunes have changed  ( thank goodness )  and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters .   the cinematography was amateurish  ( i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes )  .  the plot was limp and very unfunny .  you really didn't understand why anyone did anything .  it was like i had sand in my eyes ,  and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face ,  it was that painful .   the only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me .
-1	first of all ,  let me say the i am lds or rather ,  i am a mormon .  so when i watched this film ,  i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt .  i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch .  and this one was no exception .  it does have its redeeming moments .  but they are few and far between .   one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though halestorm was ashamed of our church !  in the lds church ,  congregations are called  " wards "  and the basketball court is in the  " cultural hall "  .  never once are either of these two names mentioned .  the church is never referred to by name and  " the standards "  is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes .   it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds wannabes ?  this film had so much potential !  it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer ,  but also what we believe .  instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired .  if i were not already lds ,  i'd be left thinking mormons are stupid ,  idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs .   it is not a film i will recommend to my nonlds friends .   sorry halestorm .  you can do better than this !
-1	i've never been a huge fan of mormon films .  being a mormon ,  i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos .  i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air ,  the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non-mormon friends .   boy ,  was i wrong .   i figured ,  since this had b-list talent like clint howard ,  gary coleman ,  andrew wilson ,  and fred willard  ( one of my favorites )  ,  this would have to be at least a little funny .  and besides ,  church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such .  but i must say ,  throughout the entire movie ,  it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing .  every joke fell flat ,  and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored .  the dialogue was bland ,  and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen .  every single character but wilson's was less than one-dimensional .  it's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed .  i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this .  my friends and i were extras in the final game scene ,  so we went to the premiere in washington city ,  ut .  kurt hale ,  the director ,  was there ,  and i must say ,  i avoided all contact with him after the show .  he waited at the door ,  seemingly ready for feedback .  i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life ,  but it left a nasty ,  painful scar that i will never forget .   here are a few specific problems i had :  there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player ,  but these two characters came out of nowhere ,  and were impossible to care about ,  so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame ,  uninteresting characters .  there were many subplots that popped up every now and then ,  each promising the audience the chance for laughs ,  but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ,  ending before you could even start caring .  this was pretty much how the whole movie felt .   this film was a major letdown ,  and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie .  true ,  the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons .  then again ,  it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears .   please ,  do not see this movie .  keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious .  spare yourself the disappointment i went through
-1	i wanted to like this film ,  i really did .  it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat .  it tries too hard to be funny in some places  ( the daughters over zealous cooking attempts )  ,  over reaches in others  ( the scene where they clean up someone's yard ,  so he agrees to join the team )  and has some scenes that ,  while mildly interesting ,  are really just filler  ( all the work scene's )  .  and i didn't find the  " villians "  intimidating ,  or worth hating ,  so much as i found them to be childishly annoying .    i've met people like those in the film while playing church ball .  and i will say the referee's are spot on ,  still ,  in the end ,  i really didn't care all that much about the characters ,  or their quest for church ball glory .  maybe because they were all so one dimensional ,  which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall .    kurt hale ,  and halestorm entertainment ,  has made some good films ,  but this is not one of them .
-1	every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people .  if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie ,  how great will be my joy .   where to begin my discussion of pain .  for starters ,  there was a musical montage every five minutes .  there was no character development .  every character was a stereotype .  we had swearing guy ,  fat guy who eats donuts ,  goofy foreign guy ,  etc .  the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot .  the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation .  have the directors ,  producers ,  etc .  ever even seen a movie before ?  halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry .  the concept for this movie sounded so funny .  how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors .  but trust me when i say this ,  things went wrong ,  very wrong .
-1	i was not expecting much going in to this ,  but still came away disappointed .  this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen .  i thought it was supposed to be a comedy ,  but i only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes .  is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over ?  what was up with the janitor in heaven scene ?  fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations ,  but this did not work .  they must have spent all the budget on getting  " known "  actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget .  it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark .  does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket ,  as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket ?  i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies ,  but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie .
-1	this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen !  some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor .  this nail trap catches these bad guys .  the rest of the movie degrades as you go .  i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time .  i also can't believe that there are sequels !  the next crap movie that i want to watch is r . o . t . o . r .  could r . o . t . o . r really be much worse than this ?
-1	first ,  let's all agree that lorenzo lamas could never be considered a skilled actor ,  barely even decent ,  sometimes just plain lousy .  however ,  in this piece of @* ! ^ called snakeeater ,  the film industry as a whole sank .   first ,  let's start with the plot .  a vietnam vet named jack kelly ,  aka soldier  ( who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some ,  which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys' feet and pins them to the floor )  ,  gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped .  therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister .  had some potential ,  but still pretty thin to begin with .   now ,  the acting .  being an actor myself ,  i am qualified to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art !  !  !  !  !  lamas is ,  well ,  himself .  the jackasses playing the clampets/deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so-called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere ,  especially talented ones who never get their big break !   finally ,  the action .  the gunfighting is so-so at best ,  and the fist-fighting is deplorable .  i've seen more real-looking fights at the renaissance festival  ( and those were pretty fake-looking )  !   readers ,  listen to me :  avoid this piece of caca at all costs !  if it were the only film in existence ,  you still would want to avoid it !  for the sake of your brain-cell count ,  do not watch this thing !
-1	wow what can i say .  i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick ,  but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance  . lorenzo lamas ,  pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control .  it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse .  crazed hillbilles yep !  needless tit shot  ( with a real weird scar )  yep !  crappy soundtrack yep !  i wish i could give the movie -10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes .  seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real .  .  .  .  .  .  the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies !  .  .  .  .  .  .  guess its in demand .
-1	lorenzo lamas stars as jack `solider` kelly an ex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks .  atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed ,  and yet has 3 minutes of screen time ,  and even those aren't any good .  overall a terrible movie ,  but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few  ( unintentional )  laughs .  followed by an improved sequel .
-1	this is a really bad film ,  with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though !  .  all the characters are just annoying  ( except lamas )  ,  and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for !  ,  plus the action is very boring .  the film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring ,  laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up !  ,  plus it looks very cheap and amateurish !  .  lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he can't save this piece of crap ,  and believe it or not the opening was really cool ,  as was the ending ,  however the middle is incredibly boring ,  and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button !  ,  plus the dialog is especially laughable !  . there is a cool bar scene that i really liked ,  but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart ,  plus the scene where the villains torture jennifer's family ,  and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable !  .  this is a really bad film ,  with bad acting and a very boring pace ,  lorenzo lamas is really cool though !  ,  however it is not enough ,  not recommended .  the direction is very bad .  george erschbamer does a very bad job here ,  with mediocre camera work ,  bland location ,  and keeping the film at a boring pace .  the acting is pretty bad  ( except for lamas )  .  lorenzo lamas is awesome here ,  and while he isn't required to act ,  he is quite fun to watch ,  and has a really cool character ,  and had a lot of charisma ,  however even he can't save this one , and he had no chemistry with the cast either !   ( lamas rules !  )  .  josie bell is terrible here ,  and while she's decent looking ,  she isn't very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas .  cheryl jeans is hot ,  but does not have much to do but scream and scared ,  she did okay at that . robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain ,  and wasn't menacing at all ,  he was laughable as were the other 2 .  rest of the cast are bad .  overall avoid !  avoid !  ,  even if you do like lamas  ( like me )  .  * out of 5
-1	now ,  i've seen a lot of bad movies .  i like bad movies .  especially bad action movies .  i've seen  ( and enjoyed )  all of jean-claude van damme's movies ,  including the one where he's his own clone ,  both of the ones where he plays twins ,  and all three where he's a cyborg .  i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians .   ( hey ,  if nothing else ,  he's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it .  with dvd ,  you can even pause and zoom in !  )  that's why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad ,  it makes plan 9 look like citizen kane .   everything about snake eater is bad .  the plot is bad .  the script is bad .  the sets are bad .  the fights are bad .  the stunts are bad .  the fx are bad .  the acting is spectacularly ,  earth-time-bendingly bad ,  very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast ,  including lorenzo lamas ,  and that's really saying something .  and i'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed ,  to boot .  especially lorenzo lamas .    it does manage to be unintentionally funny ,  so it's not a total loss .  however ,  i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very ,  very stoned .  i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry .   it didn't help much ,  but it was better than nothing .  one point for ron palillo's cameo as a gay arsonist .
-1	hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of russ meyer films back in the day ,  you will surely be pleased to see that haji is still looking really hot ,  though forry ackerman has not fared so well  ( what is he doing still making these movies anyway ?  if i go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie ?  )  .  it was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length ,  and the jokes were on a level with your average joe e .  brown comedy  ( or ,  abbott and costello if that's your thing )  -- basically just bad puns .  still ,  i found this movie fascinating to watch ,  and for more than 2 reasons .  good job ,  but still a fundamentally flimsy production .
-1	words can't simply describe how awful this film is .  i watched it on video last night ,  and i simply could not believe what i was seeing .  basically ,   " snakeeater "  is about an ex-military man  ( lorenzo lamas )  and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance-style rednecks .  the film's acting ,  writing ,  direction ,  photography ,  and editing are deplorable along with a song called  " soldier "  that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time !   however ,  there is one treat .   " horshack "   ( ron pallio )  from  " welcome back carter "  is in the film playing a laughable bad guy .  otherwise ,  please avoid this mess at all costs .
-1	" that 'malcom' show on fox is really making a killing .  .  .  can't we do our own version ?  "  i speculate and paraphrase ,  of course ,  but in our hearts we all know it's true ,  and that the only thing nbc added to the 'malcom' metric was sex .  and ,  boy ,  did they add sex .  .  .   thirteen-year-old tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard .  tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off .  he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window ,  and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window .  and this is all in the pilot .   take it from a grown man- a boy's puberty is so sex-crazy and testicle-driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience .  the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies ,  and you can count those on one hand .  so it's no surprise that  " tucker "  has the warmth and appeal of a strip-club bathroom .  did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty ?  isn't this the stuff people go to jail for ?  if you doubt the show's depravity consider this :  13 episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only 4 episodes aired ;  they then made the unprecedented move of  " burning off "  the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them .  ironic since kids were originally the target audience .    apart from its general scuzziness tucker features a running voice-over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing .  even in 2000 it was horribly dated ,  with it's ska incidental music and super-sarcasm .  i couldn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't exactly come a mile-a-minute .  .  .  shame on nbc for this dirty rip-off .  .  .  they're better than that .   grade :  c-
-1	first of all ,  i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes  ( cause of the bas screenplay )  .  i don't think this movie has any purpose .  it's boring from the first minute to the last .  i don't understand why this movie scores so high .  i gave it 1/10 but actually it's not more wurth then 0/10 .
-1	what were they thinking at  " cannes "  ?  one of the most irritating ,  films of all time .  every detail of this film ,  no matter how meaningless was shown .  if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted .  if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had ,  then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running .  but no ,  we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over .  the whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic characters .  they deserved the misery that was rosetta .  and to think i passed up  " tumbleweeds "  to see this over-hyped film of boredom .  it was like watching grass grow ,  only that is more exciting .
-1	i go to the cinema to be entertained .  there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film .  from beginning to end ,  there is no respite from the gray ,  grinding reality of this woman's life .  it is one-paced ,  with no change of mood .  i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better .  they don't ,  and i don't think i was the only one ,  as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close .  honestly depicting social depravation is no crime ,  but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public .  a dreadful film .
-1	if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing dogme 95 style ,  i would never have rented it .  nevertheless ,  i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot .  i lasted a very ,  very ,  very long forty minutes before giving up .  it's just boring ,  pretentious twaddle .   the last french movie i saw was  " romance "  and it too was pretty dismal ,  but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time .  i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme 95 overseas -- it'll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy .   ( it's called dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera .  )
-1	i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm d'or at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious !  i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film .  there is nothing interesting about the plot ,  the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects .  also ,  if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film ,  be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects .  this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as  " blair witch "  because it creates suspense .  in rosetta ,  there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything .  i should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible .
-1	i hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input .  i know they're going for realism ,  but to be frank i just don't want realism .  realism is boring .  if i want to see daily life ,  i'll uhm ,  live .  tell me an interesting story and we'll talk .  i can deal with the low production values ,  hell i'm a sucker for low production values ,  but at least work in some good ideas .  the direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit ,  but obviously i'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic .  hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out .  i can only conclude this is not drama ,  not by a long shot .  we get to see rosetta walking to someplace ,  rosetta working in a bakery ,  rosetta eating a waffle ,  rosetta carrying around bags of far ,  rosetta walking back home ,  rosetta walking someplace .  .  . it's just not that entertaining .  there isn't really a deeper meaning either .  i got so bored i started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it's just plain realism ,  the most overrated quality in the business .  i guess i'm supposed to love this ,  but come on ,  there's nothing in there .
-1	this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god-awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television .  the house-mates are dull ,  uninteresting ,  ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them .  as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society ,  showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain-dead morons .  whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience ?  this cannot be classified as entertainment .  i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul .  it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and ,  once moving to channel 10 ,  become horribly unfunny .  with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made .
-1	i watched this a few days ago ,  so details are getting hazy .  the film is shot on hand-held cameras ,  and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally ,  since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way .  i can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything ,  designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the compromises that come with a big budget ,  and so was more  " real "  .  however what we have here isn't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket ,  so anyone who has seen that ,  or any one of the other rip offs there of ,  will know what to expect .   the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters ,  with the weedy soft kids out of their depth ,  close harmony singing ,  ebonics spouting black dudes ,  world weary sergeants ,  bitter and twisted psychos etc etc .  .  .  all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time .  maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation ,  maybe it was laziness ,  or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience ,  all i know is it was annoying .  one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees  ( where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation ,  )  although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it .  this seems to be the main pivot of the plot ,  with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth ,  but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way .  the other big bug i had was how all the characters  ( with the exception of the psychos and the real softies )  would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence ,  faced with farrell's ubiquitous stoicism ,  immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic .   i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads ,  which was strong and very convincing ,  tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters ,  this wasn't too hard .   in my imagination ,  bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty ,  and for my money ,  4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch .
-1	if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste .  the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse .  the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine ,  but wheres the experiment ?  all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don't know or want to know about .  .  .  the challenges are pathetic and silly .  the whole point of reality tv is to show reality .  if you set a 'challenge' don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in 'friday night games' .  make them do an actual challenge .  and as for 'earning' prize money ,  thats fine ,  if they actually earnt it !  these people are nuts .  if only they would make the show better ,  the actual idea would be glorious .  but that ain't gonna happen !
-1	this is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'funky monkey . ' finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local cineplex odeon .  after seeing such classics as 'every which way but loose' and 'project x , ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome .   these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie .  there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required .  it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting .  perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought .   maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan .  luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look-a-like matthew modine .  while some might argue that matthew modine doesn't come close to jet li ,  camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good .  when it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie ,  the movie leans on matthew modine to be the real star .   did i mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with modine and the monkey ?  is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie ?  even matthew modine should get jealous with this one  ( because using the pick-up line 'i'm second fiddle to a monkey' doesn't seem to work with the ladies .  )   shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew modine telling them 'seven days . '
-1	i bought this movie from gamestop's discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for 99cents .  the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike .  not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey .   the director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros .  film and he ended up owing money to the studio .  it also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did ,  he wasn't even known for producing a poop-chute film .   why was this movie ever made ?
-1	i am a student of film ,  and have been for several years .  and the concept of a cyber ,  kung-fu ,  satirical chimpanzee had me wondering ,   " is this the film that's going to break the mold ?  "  let's face it ,  america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar .  after such great classics as  " monkey trouble "  and  " dunston checks in "  ,  i thought that the best ideas were already taken .  but then comes  " funky monkey "  .  i laughed ,  i cried ,  i contemplated suicide .   now i've read about demon possession in the bible ,  but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil .  first off ,  having at least a shred of intelligence ,  i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape ,  not a monkey at all .  however ,  i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film .  they didn't .  let me sum up this work of art :  a company by the name of z . i . t .  has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers .  why ?  i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas ,  but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp ,  this doesn't seem cost-effective .  well anyways ,  z . i . t .  brings in a cia specialist  ( matthew modine )  to train clemens  ( the chimp )  .  clemens is everything z . i . t .  hoped for .  he can take out an entire shift of guards ,  who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall ,  and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie .  as you may have guessed ,  modine finds out that z . i . t . 's intentions may be evil  ( gasp !  )  and decides to break clemens out .  being a cia agent and all ,  modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city ,  rent a guest room ,  regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime ,  and using checks to pay for everything .   z . i . t .  finds out where modine is staying ,  and sends two of their finest to retrieve him .  these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis ,  or was it turner and hooch ?  it doesn't matter anyways ,  because in the end ,  for a heck of a twist ending ,  the good guys win !  !  !  yay !  hooray for predictability !  throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself ,  a lonely mom who needs a date ,  and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get  " funky monkey "  .  the climax to the movie ?  a football game !  played by thugs ,  bumblers ,  a chimp ,  and the nerd boy .  no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game .   funky monkey never lets up !  it's edge of your seat entertainment .  some might even call this the  " american beauty "  of monkey-filled features .  after finishing this epic ,  i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe .  funky monkey is a metal rod among movies .
-1	having watched this after receiving the dvd for christmas 2005 ,  i came here to pan it -- but after reading the other comments ,  i haven't the heart .  clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age .  well ,  let me not be a complete grinch ;  it might still work for some children -- if they are not too media-saturated and have not become visually over-sophisticated ,  e . g .  from watching all of lotr and harry potter .  but if you are an adult ,  stay miles away ;  you will not enjoy it .   the good bits :  barbara kellerman as the witch ,  especially in her early scenes with edmund ,  creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness .   ( at the stone table she goes a bit over the top .  )  michael aldridge in the minor role of the professor and jeffrey s .  perry as mr .  tumnus also have the kind of polished ,  skillful acting we'd expect from the very best bbc dramas .  and the aslan costume works very well ,  amazingly well considering .  they got the eyes just right .   the bad bits :  almost everything else ,  but two areas in particular .  one ,  the casting .  england is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive british school kids .  how could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs ?  they move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well .  peter has no gravitas or charisma  ( and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings )  ;  edmund is just whiny ;  and lucy .  .  .  sophie wilcox as lucy is so dramatically ,  visibly ,  drastically wrong for this part that i can't imagine how she got the job .   two ,  the animal costumes .  again ,  it appears that they worked for some kids .  if the kids are still at a level where big bird and elmo are exciting ,  believable characters ,  they might be entranced by this film .  but to a viewer with the sophistication of ,  say ,  a 12-year-old who's seen prisoner of azkaban ?  when mister beaver comes out from behind that tree ,  there will be hoots of cruel ,  derisive laughter .  the costumes just do not work -- i could not ,  and i think any adult or modern teen could not ,  suspend disbelief when looking at mister beaver .  the drawn animation later  ( gryphons ,  etc .  )  works better ,  is easier to take .   so :  ten stars for the very young and tender of soul ;  everyone else read ,  or re-read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination .
-1	i'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books .  i wanted to see this just to see how it was done .  all i can say ,  is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it .  its pretty bad ,  and will turn you off reading them .  not to be mean ,  but lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie .  was she the directors daughter ?  seriously ,  i'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth .  she had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame .  the movie just loses so much in translation .  cs books don't translate as easily as the tolkein lotr books ,  or even harry potter .   one thing they did right !  aslan !  very well done .  although the other human actors with painted faces  (  beavers ,  wolf )  look silly ,  aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around .   (  i guess its like that old horse custume ?  2 people inside ?   )  also ,  i would be curious what kids think of this movie .  maybe they would enjoy it ?  but as for adults ,  safe bet they wont ,  even if a cs fan .
-1	ouch !  they don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c .  s .  lewis's beloved novel .  while the adaptation is very true to the novel ,  the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play .  i've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time ,  but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for .  the worst effect of all is mr .  beaver .  i know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time ,  but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid .  better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role !  avoid this at all costs .
-1	though the movie may have been  " true "  to lewis's book  ( in that the script was basically word-for-word ,  verbatim )  ,  it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this .  the mythical creatures  ( unicorns ,  centaurs ,  griffins ,  ghouls ,  ghosts )  are *drawn* in ,  and as in the previous review ,  the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow .  i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ;  i nearly cried when i heard the wolf's  " howl-- "  a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could .   all of the acting is tremendously forced ,  especially that of little lucy penvensie .  .  .  i could only take so much indignation ,  desperation ,  and buck teeth in the  ( what felt like )  fourteen hours of watching the movie .  the actress who plays the white witch ,  in all her histrionics ,  seems that she'd be more at home on stage ,  where a booming voice ,  spread arms ,  and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome .    the sets feel claustrophobic ,  whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors .  indoors ,  it's as if bbc could only afford to spend $100 on constructing a set ,  and so it is very small ,  and all the characters are constantly huddled together .  the white witch's castle is a run-down ,  rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting .  when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods-- actually ,  *any* scene in the woods-- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles .    the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan ,  but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film's entire budget on building the mechanical feline .  it looks great when it's standing still and before it starts speaking ,  but once it starts moving ,  you can't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit .    yes ,  if you are a hardcore narnia fan ,  you may want to see this version ,  simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote-- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter ,  and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen .  during the scene in which the children are at the beavers' and getting ready to flee from the wolves ,  mrs .  beaver's incessant ,   " oh ,  just one more thing ,  dearies ,  and then we will be ready to go ,  "  punctuated by the children's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of  " no ,  mrs .  beaver ,  please !  "  -- a scene of comic relief ,  so incongruous  ( they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger ,  not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not )  ,  detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have .  in fact ,  the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these .    i would recommend seeing the new narnia  ( disney 2005 )  .  the new movie ,  with updated effects ,  spectacular computer animation ,  great timing all around ,  and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch  ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician ,  as opposed to a shrieking banshee )  captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis's original vision  ( i think )  .  lucy is a lot cuter  ( no buck teeth ,  yay !  )  ,  as are the beavers  ( and realistically-sized )  ,  and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine ,  desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts .    unless you're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies ,  i would not recommend this film to anyone .
-1	this movie is terrible but it has some good effects .
-1	while some scenes of training were realistic ,  too many of them depicted military instructors as ex-nazi types .  obviously ,  the people who wrote the screen play were either anti-military types or writing a film for that audience .   i am a viet nam vet and ,  even during this period ,  military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison .   and i really loved the scene where the  " hero "  and his buddy  ( both privates )  are sitting down in the captain's office ,  smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their buddy .  this sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation ,  as was the purpose for the scene .   at the end i asked myself ,   " what was this film about ?  "  as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except  " i hate all authority .  "  thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it .
-1	i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment . once i realized i would not be getting that , i watched it for a pretty well made movie  ( in terms of filming , and yeah .  . that was it )  . but aside from it having a good film quality , considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long , there was nothing good about that movie .   he killed 42 . why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully ? serisouly , who can answer that for me ? who can answer anything awful about this movie for me .   i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff . that's all it seemed to be .   poor mr . carroll . i'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales .
-1	i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival .  sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin .  being a devout fan of lewis carroll's 'alice' books i was very excited about this movie's premier ,  which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch .  normally i'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well .  usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story .  unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion .  the adaptation of the original's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying .  it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either .  most performances were ridiculously over the top ,  which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script .  i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film .  all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by .  really ,  the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice ,  but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny elfman's work .  also ,  i'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful .  it was with out a doubt the low point of the film .   what a joke .  don't see this movie .  after its conclusion i was genuinely angry .
-1	i'm actually watching this film as i write this  .   .   .  if the following comments  " prove my lack of development as a true ,  artistic film maker "  ,  then so be it  .   .   .   but  .   .   .  i thought  ( am still thinking as i'm presently viewing )  that this film  .   .   .  to put it mildly ,  is very ,  very overrated .  again ,  very .   it looks like a really ,  really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources  .   .   .  and who didn't pay that much attention to detail .   i don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking ,  but  .   .   .  well  .   .   .  i just don't get it  ( rememeber ,  i fully admit that maybe it's me that's the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this  " piece of imaginative genius "  )   .   .   .  i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very ,  very outstanding  .   .   .   sheesh  .   .   .
-1	a friend once told me that an art-house independent film ran in a cinema when- upon the closing of the film - audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats .  of course ,  my imagination ran amok ,  trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work .  well , now my imagination can be put to rest .   i am a lifelong andrei tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work .  i have come across many people who thought tarkovsky's films are slow-moving and inert .  opinions being what they are ,  i found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works ,  which are wrought with meaning ,  beautiful compositions ,  and complex philosophical questions .  upon hearing aleksandr sokurov called the heir to tarkovsky ,  i was excited to experience his films .   with the exception of the open air ride through the fields  ( stalker )  ,  this movie has no kinship to anything tarkovsky has done .  it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning ,  even on a completely mindless level .  it's supposedly  " gorgeously stark "  cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft .  there is a no balance ,  no proportion ,  and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow .  the main character is so inept and indecisive ,  it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner .   i am also not adverse to non-plots or story lines that progress on multiple non-linear fashion .  but there isn't even a non-story here .  one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost ,  as hair-pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a tarkosky time sculpture look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short .   i won't rule out that this may be one of sokurov's stinkers  ( tarkovsky's solaris )  ,  but to conclude that he is one of tarkovsky's heir-based on this film- would be to call paris hilton the successor to aristotle .  c'mon guys ,  don't be afraid to say it .  no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life .  i don't profess to fully understand russian culture and i probably don't have russian values ,  but i immediately picked up on tarkovsky's work as something magical ,  a treasure and a gift to viewers .   if it didn't have sokurov's name on it ,  and it aired on say ,  saturday night live ,  i'm pretty sure nobody would  " read "  all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick .
-1	believe me ,  i like horror movies .  i like science fiction movies .  i like independent films .  and ,  i like low-budget ,  b movies .    sometimes ,  i even like bad acting ,  plodding scripts ,  wooden lines ,  improbably situations ,  and the like .  however ,  i did not like christmas on mars .    it just doesn't work on so many levels .  for all the reasons listed previously ,  and many more .  that includes the nonsensical ,  blatant use of images of female genitalia .  and the many allusions to male genitalia ,  in a very freudian way .   i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude .  as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different .  i mean any movie that takes years to film ,  just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences .   i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character .  however ,  sadly ,  it was meant to have happened ,  as we saw things unfold on screen .    about the only kindness that i can express ,  is that the image at the end was stupendous .  if this had been used at the beginning ,  instead of the end ,  it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended .  .  .    to bad they didn't try that instead .  i just don't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made .  was it the plot ?  surely ,  it couldn't be .  was it the characters ?  i doubt it ;  i mean ,  i could live without knowing about ed 15 .  was it the dialog ?  emphatically ,  no .  the music ?  perhaps ,  but more-likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked .    much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor .
-1	*** this contains many ,  many spoilers ,  not that it matters ,  since everything is so patently obvious ***  oh my god ,  where do i start ?  well ,  here - this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said  " i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now .  it is my civic duty .  "  such is the badness of this flick .    *begin digression* but let me just state one thing before i start .  i'm not some harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie  ( in fact ,  i went to the college at the other end of mass .  ave in cambridge ,  the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go ,  which should put me squarely in the nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-films census group ,  and still i hated this film .  .  .  )  .  my viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the die hards ,  bond flicks ,  clerks ,  and the grail .  i wish the titanic had never sunk ,  not so much for the lives lost ,  but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that dung-heap of a film .  and the single and only reason i will watch a snooty french art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed emmanuelle beart in it .  i even gave maximum overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on imdb ,  for god's sake .  so i'm as shallow as they come ,  therefore i'm not criticizing this film because i'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence - it's because elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat .  *end digression*  ok ,  there's so much badness here that i have to try to categorize it .  here goes :   ms .  garner :  one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot jgar  ( i have no idea why my wife wanted to )  .  i think that between this and  " finding nemo "  ,  the latter was the sexier film .  you know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see ?  you see her in it twice - once at the beginning ,  once at the end .  bummer .  in the rest ,  she basically looks like what morrissey would look like if he were a female - lots of pouting and black clothes .  which brings me to the incredible range of expression jgar shows in her acting - ranging from  " pouting "  all the way to  " pouting and crying "  .  oh my god ,  you'd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that .  um ,  wait .  .  .   the bad guys/gal :  they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit .  at least next to jgar's performance ,  it doesn't stand out too badly .  one guy's role is to stand there and be huge ,  another's is to stand there and have stuff come out of him ,  and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and/or kiss people .  they manage to pull these incredible feats off .  the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all - he has to simultaneously a )  appear angry and b )  appear asian .  he does a fine job at this .  i think there was a fifth bad guy/gal ,  but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self-defense .   plot twists !  this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the democratic national convention .  let's just put it this way - my wife ,  who has only been in the u . s .  for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in jg's pad ,  and i swear to god i am not making this up :   " she go to house to kill girl .  and father too .  "  and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen .  now my wife isn't stupid ,  but she isn't being courted by mensa for her gifts ,  either ,  and she's had zero exposure to daredevil or the comic book genre .  and she figured this out in  . 00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information .  such is the blatant obviousness of this film .    rarely-before-seen stupidity !  ok ,  so there's this big dude in the film .  he can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it's lint ,  and he can take a vicious electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal  ( or melt it - or something - more defenses kicking in ,  thank god )  .  but jg jumps on his head ,  and he explodes ?  an achilles noggin ?  ok !  such is the mind-numbing stupidity of this film .   ack .  i'm starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on ,  so i have to stop .  but you have been warned .  if you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie ,  do it .  and if armageddon is going to come ,  please let it be >before< this comes out on dvd .
-1	perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what electra is like in current publications .  .  .  but the electra that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan .  she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved .  just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way .   this movie was fairly weak on the dialog ,  the acting wasn't particularly convincing ,  and the action was spotty .  i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank miller's book  " electra assassin .  "  which is much darker than anything in this movie .   special effect where cool ,  action was interesting at times ,  but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical .  tha hand was not menacing enough ,  and electra was not .  .  .  .  .  bitchy enough .  she's the girl you love to hate .  .  .  but in this story ,  i just didn't care either way .
-1	this is absurd - aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick ,  i can't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra ,  considering how generous they were with their praise .   admittedly i'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so i didn't go in with many expectations ,  yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming .  the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained ,  that left you thinking  " huh ,  what relevance does that have to the plot ?  "  or  " so how did that aspect of the character come about ?  "  i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil ,  which i have no intention of seeing .   furthermore ,  the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about-face at random moments to suit the storyline ,  and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot .  i'm also  ( still )  scratching my head over the fate of cary-hiroyuki tagawa's character ,  which seems to have gone by unexplained .   if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot ,  but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra .  i know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action films ,  but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing  ( even by action film standards )  that it simply frustrated me .   well ,  hell ,  at least jennifer garner looks damn good .
-1	how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me .  overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie .  terrible script ,  with forced character quirks  ( the brown sauce )  .  romanticising all that is bad about dublin .  the attitude of 'ah ,  it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same' .  plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences  ( the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase )  .  and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character .  a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old .  cringeworthy stuff .  the best thing about this movie is farrell ,  and it's a bad when you have to say that .  well ,  at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent .  international audiences be warned :  stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock .  you'll have a better time .  intermission is a walk-outer
-1	this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film .  it was a big wannabee .  it wanted to be an edgy ,  nervous-laughter ,  urban-life affirming film ,  but it's more of a camera jerky ,  mess .  it's a lot easier to imitate something else ,  than to create a real story with real characters .  from the beginning ,  i couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in .  they were always always hitting ,  pissing ,  or crying on each other .  only ,  there wasn't any substance to what they were doing .  the dialog between characters is meant to be hip ,  revealing ,  instead it comes out trite ,  and one scene after another is predictable .  i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie ,  so i could be wrong .
-1	if you loved  " pulp fiction "  and like hand held cameras you should love this film .  i liked the quirky story  ( even though i feel that  " pulp fiction "  was the most over-rated movie since  " the english patient "  )  and found the characters unrealistic but interesting .  it's not  " on the waterfront "  or  " citizen kane "  and is burdened by european pretentiousness .  but the worst part by far is the hand held camera .  it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end .  i don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great .  if you are prone to motion sickness ,  stay away ,  the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes .
-1	i realise that the us army was demoralised by 1971 ,  but this film was unbelievable .  it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel .  the writer must be a real army hater .  the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell ,  and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well .  these men were going overseas ,  the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from ,  and an investigation would have ensued .  the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one .  farrell ,  the alleged barrack room lawyer ,  would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order  (  to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention  )  ,  actual assault on an enlisted man ,  sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer .  intead he just walks away .  after this ,  discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable .  i don't know how it ended ,  i went to bed .
-1	i'm irish and i've been living in denmark for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see intermission .  and i will go on record as saying :   this film is awful .   it is not quite as bad a something like  " the most fertile man in ireland "  but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the commitments ,  i went down or michael collins .   some aspects of the film are actually quite funny ,  such as colm meaneys american-style garda .  but the film itself is shot completely wrong .  the bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom-in ,  zoom-out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama .  but it isn't .  this is an irish lock ,  stock and two smoking barrels and it should be shot like this .  it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next .  the film just looks sloppy and thrown together .   the performances are okay ,  given the awful script .  a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around dublin for a week .  he gives a decent display as a dublin dirtbag ,  but it no way compares to his performances in minority report ,  tigerland or phone booth .  the best performance was from dierdre o'kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman .  i think she should leave her god-awful stand-up and focus more on her acting .   all in all ,  its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever .   i'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great .  but before you reply ,  ask yourself :  would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america ?
-1	this movie blows - let's get that straight right now .  there are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot .  colin farrel looks like brad pitt in  " 12 monkeys "  and acts in a similar manner .  i normally hate colin because he is a fairy in general but he's ok in this movie .  there were two plot lines in this movie-= one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache .  let's face it- this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go .  the characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script .  the whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional ok scene .  but overall- don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the lucky charms elf -an american fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success .
-1	a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one .  it needed some dependence on something .   this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people .  were they trying to imitate the wonderful film  " crash ?  "  if so ,  this film crashed entirely .   there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem .   the film is just too choppy to work .  one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor .  this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing .  the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance .   then ,  we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank .  obviously ,  the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks .  perhaps ,  the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film .
-1	i live in ottawa where this film was made and i really wish it hadn't been .  this is one god-awful flick .  i really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is :  indie films blow .  well ,  this film does nothing to shed this curse .  the actor ,  writer ,  director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre ,  rather he re-hashes tired clichés from movies past .  i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting ,  it's way too overdone .    i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights .  now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension ,  but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie .  as well for a movie that dares to call itself horror ,  a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore ,  other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring .    the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development ,  the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back .  not that this concept bugs me ,  but ,  i didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters ,  both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other .  this is done in such a short time span that it's inconceivable ,  my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her .    the last point that i have is .  .  .  .  and i won't hold this against kelly ,  but the movie is shot entirely on boring ,  emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film .  although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat .  my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel ,  which has been reported on his website ,  a sequel that was half written in one sitting .    lord help us all .
-1	usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating ,  and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating .  this is not the case here .   bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 film .  it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything .  there are strands of a bad d&d novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout .  it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort ,  because even a completely patently untalented persons' hard work would amount to more .  a truly awful film .
-1	words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is .  i wish it were  " so bad it's good ,  "  but it's not .  it's just dull ,  lifeless ,  and boring .  it's so bad i couldn't even laugh at it .   in response to other posters ,  anne-marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie .  the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly ,  who as a true statement on vanity ,  cast himself as the male lead .  they both look like inbreeds ,  sister and brother .   the gal ,  sherry thurig ,  is a looker .  the complete opposite of anne-marie - attractive .  this girl is tall and willowy ,  and can act .  although you can tell she's holding back .   all the actors seem to be holding back ,  especially the supporting male ,  mark .  i've seen less wood in a rain forest ,  but he's still better than kelly .  why would kelly keep his actors from acting ?  is he really that bad a director ?  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one .  kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime .  i know how he felt stepping in the poo ,  it's how i felt after watching his movie .   yes ,  i tried to get my money back from the rental store .  this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  ( and if you search them out ,  you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks )  .
-1	a truly frightening film .  feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good ,  normal ,  mainstream-aspiring people .  retrograde to the point of being offensive ,  ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad ,  lonely ,  sex-crazed gays .  wow !  who knew ?  the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes  ( the effeminate buffoon ,  the bitter ,  lonely queen ,  the fag hag ,  etc .  )  and the main characters are milquetoast ,  middle-class ,  middlebrow clones ,  of little interest .   as far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned ,  there's not much to say :  we've seen it all before ,  and done much better .
-1	or listening to ,  for that matter .  even the soundtrack is a bore .    honestly ,  this isn't the worst gay movie i've seen  ( that would be regarding billy )  ,  but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel .   this thing drags and drags and drags .  it's not that the plot is inane--in the hands of a good writer it might have worked  .   .   .  it certainly could have been much more entertaining .  there's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road .  the dialog is flat .  the jokes are old .  to add insult to injury ,  it's full of one-dimensional ,  stereotypical gays .    nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible ,  much less real .  there was no chemistry ,  no dynamic ,  in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other  .   .   .  we're just told they're in love .  hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually .  they like the same book ?  huh ?   the acting is not totally bad ,  but the pacing is excruciatingly slow .  i mean ,  almost jarmusch- slow ,  but without jarmusch quality .  in fact ,  that would be a good barometer for you .  if you like jarmusch films ,  avoid this one .
-1	movie had some good acting and good moments  ( though obviously pretty low budget )  ,  but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed .  the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all .  there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it ,  but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently ,  especially since the employment of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life  ( and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money .  )  also ,  several times glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is  ( apologizing to adam for his past )  while adam is shown to be upstanding and  " traditional ,  "  which the film proclaims to be the  " good "  way in the end .  i don't like being preached to like that .  i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing ltr ,  and he said that he presented this conflict between them because ,  if he was in glenn's shoes  ( and he said he does in real life relate to glenn's view )  that he could never date someone with adam's views .  well ,  then ,  i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film .  also ,  director said he directed this ,  his first movie ,  only after reading  ( directing for dummies .  )  directing was not that bad ,  but far from a top notch effort .  i've seen worse ,  but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated .
-1	i got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart .  i would not recommend watching this move .  i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours .   i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie .  i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on .  it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie .  it's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another .  the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam .   okay ,  here is my rant about this movie :  to me ,  this movie is slow and hard to watch .  it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end .  it doesn't .  after the movie was over i through it behind my t . v .  because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it ,  and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it .
-1	when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago ,  it would have been something quite different for the time .  so therefor some people would have found it quite scary ,  and may well have been impressed with the special effects ?   looking at the play in this day and age ,  it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore ,  even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired .   would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel ?  i don't think so .  .  .  .  .  . but if you watch this play again ,  you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel ,  rushes straight through the red light !   ( maybe that's how it was in dickens time )  ?   you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state .  surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting .   ( i can't help but notice things like that )   i will not take anything away from the acting ,  both denholm elliott  ( signalman )  and bernard lloyd  ( the traveller )  gave wonderful performances .   i am not at all sure what is going on .  .  .  .  .  . i mean was the ghost the traveller ,  or what ?  ?  ?  does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ?  ?  ?   ( well maybe i am the only one that don't )  ?  ?  ?   to sum up .  .  .  .  .   the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout ,  with great character .  it suffers from not being that scary these days ,  and a little if not very confusing in places ,  and has some rather unusual signalling practises .  .  .  .   thanks for reading my review .
-1	i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about .  somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't .  this brought back memories of the good old days  ( bad old days ?  )  when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers .  lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism ,  mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time .  i've never found margaret atwood's books easy to read .  this movie continues that fine canadian tradition .  it isn't easy to watch .  maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it .  us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious .
-1	i don't know what margaret atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book .  i've always been a big fan of the robber bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works .  i am aware that the translation of book to movie isn't perfect but this movie was the worst ever .  the names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it .  i feel like i lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie .  this really should have been a mini-series to tell the story the way it was written .   the actors for roz ,  tony ,  charis and zenia were well-chosen even though i was skeptical at first about mary-louise parker .  i only wish they'd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all .
-1	when i saw that mary louise parker was associated with this epic novel turned film ,  i was intrigued .  being a fan of the book ,  i assumed she'd be playing tony ,  roz ,  or charis ,  but more so ,  i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y ,  almost psychological  ( but not psychological thriller )  novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn't read the novel ,  and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had .  the book is a complex reflection of society ,  women ,  and modern life ,  and i was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film .  what they actually did was a crime .   the biggest error and confusing issue is :  why would oxygen ,  a network that advertises as being for women ,  take an amazing book about how complex ,  wonderful ,  and terrible women are and can be ,  and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story ?  it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz ,  tony ,  and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that ,  they rushed through bulk of the book .  in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it ,  aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with .  in the film ,  these women aren't people ,  they are characters .   in the book zenia does fake her death ,  but the book mentions it to get this point across ,  while the film wastes 30-45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use .  they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi .   it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia ,  which was so wrong .  zenia is a catherine zeta-jones ,  angelina jolie ,  or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type .  she is a woman men can't not adore ,  and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by ,  but in a  " keep your enemies closer "  kind of way .  and once she gets closer ,  she seems totally genuine and trust worthy ,  despite your better judgment .  she's the kind of woman who ,  even when she loses ,  she wins :  she's always still beautiful ,  still rich ,  and there are always still people out there who don't know her game .   in the film ,  zenia didn't take charis's man  ( the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place .  .  .  )  but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian  ( and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies )  .  and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august ,  but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed .  it's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book ,  but i think had i not read the book ,  i would have spent the whole movie confused ,  if i had bothered to stick with it at all .   and roz's husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture  ( which was weird since zenia took roz's business and home life in the book ,  which is why roz hated her so much )  and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz's husband years and years back .  and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever .  .  . even at the party where zenia and west  ( in the book )  had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it  ( and evil ,  bitchy )  person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it .  tony's character was so wrong in this film .  .  . she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky ,  mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book .  the film basically implied smart women are evil ,  beautiful women are evil ,  powerful women are evil ,  and women who teach yoga are off their rockers .   they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn't necessarily as awful as she was in the book ,  and then ,  in the end ,  the three women convince this former cop  ( who ,  of course in the process of researching this ,  meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous ,  which of course zenia bails on )  to hide zenia's body  ( which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at ,  but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony ,  or they conspired together to do it .  .  .  )  and then zenia also managed to take all of roz's money in the process .  by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b/c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been .   if you aren't confused by this breakdown of the film ,  then maybe you would like it ,  because i have read the book and seen the movie ,  and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused .  it was terrible .  i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task ,  but if you are going to take on the task ,  you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary ,  instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland .    are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of ?
-1	i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood's novel 'the robber bride' ,  and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version .  a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder ,  and his buddy ,  an ex-cop journalist ,  tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends .  it's fortunate that the movie script fixes ms .  atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men ,  victims of scheming women .  .  .   heh .  okay ,  you got me .  if these guys are mentioned in the book ,  and i'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie ,  i'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy .  apparently ,  the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie .  zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man ,  and a man's life is screwed up .  roz ,  charis ,  and toni tell their stories -- to a man .  because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them .   i liked the characters in the book .  it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story .  i normally do not look for feminist angles on media ,  and i tried to enjoy the movie as is .  if i hadn't read the book ,  i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more .  so if you like the cop and the ex-cop ,  and you want to read more about them ,  you're out of luck .  read the novel ,  if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot .  it's the same plot :  the movie excavated it ,  ironed it ,  and sprinkled it with male angst .  it's like zenia's revenge on margaret atwood .
-1	if i had never read the book ,  i would have said it was a good movie .  but i did read the book .  who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline .  there is so many changes ,  that it wasn't really worthy of the title .  character changes ,  plot changes ,  time line changes .  .  .   first off who was henry and the investigator ?  they weren't in the story .  henry had mitch's persona somewhat ,  but mitch wasn't a cop .  no you made it so roz ,  helped 'sink ' his body and used that as zenia's blackmail against roz .  the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him .  her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother .  her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story .  neither i don't believe was his lover ,  roz's secretary .   tony and west were not together in the beginning .  he was actually with zenia first while in college .  the black painted apartment was their idea ,  tony just went to visit .  this is where zenia and tony meet ,  become fast friends .  tony hides her love for west .  then zenia left west ,  with cash from tony ,  then west and tony get together .  eventually marry ,  at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time .  only to be heart broken again .  then go back to tony .  zenia's blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia .  now being a professor at college she didn't want to let it get out .  i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully .   charis character was a blond ,  not that it really matters .  zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive .  no she was there when charis had a lover named billy .  augusta's father ,  he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war .  eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal .  zenia and billy have an affair right under charis's nose while taking care of them both .  then zenia turns in billy to the government ,  and leaves on the ferry with him .  not with augusta ,  charis was pregnant with her tho .  charis also had a split personality ,  karen was her real name .   zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's .  .  .  .  she fell or was possibly pushed  ( we never really knew )  off the balcony and landed in a fountain .  she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od'd .  she was also really dieing of cancer this time around .   it didn't show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader .  the book was striped down to its bare bones .  then re made in someone else's vision .  why couldn't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie .  it was different enough ,  and i'm sure could have been made more so .
-1	*warning - no plot spoilers ahead ,  but movie spoilers nonetheless .  .  . * my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast .  wow - very ,  very wrong .  this movie is an overdone ,  overwrought ,  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot !  the copyright date on the box said 2005 ,  yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s ,  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos .  it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film !  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback ,  and therefore supposed to look old ,  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s .  .  .  then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up ,  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  ( yet it's a different ,  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks )  .  i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences ,  shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie !  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  ( and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes )  .  thus ,  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old ,  re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time .  the shell story ,  shot in 2005 ,  is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the  " fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ?  )  these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful ,  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie .  don't bother .  there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible .
-1	i ended up watching this whole  ( very long )  movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it .  it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people  ( anthony quinn ,  lawrence olivier ,  john gielguld ,  vittorio de sica ,  etc .  )  would have willingly participated in this farce .  but maybe in 1968 people really *were* so naive ?  the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda .  there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys ,  with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man ,  who ,  suddenly ,  after 20 years ,  sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag .  the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences .  we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine .   meanwhile ,  the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death .  to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war  ( in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china )  .   our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace .  they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy .  you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like .  comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay  ( which is quite logical after all ,  don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists ?  )  ,  and that the pope needs to sacrifice something ,  too ,  for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice .   so when the pope gets crowned in rome ,  he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world-wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ .  and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust .   apart from this ,  there are also some minor sub-plots ,  which ,  alas ,  provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie .  i'd give it three oscars for stupidity .   by the way ,  anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope .  he is much more plausible as zorba the greek .
-1	my brother is an avid dvd collector .  he took one look at the cover  ( two models on toilets )  and had to add it to his collection .  i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie  ( i use that term loosely )  i've felt obligated to sit through .  i dared not make eye contact with my brother ,  quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist .  the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene ,  which the  " filmmaker "  decided to show every take of  ( about four total )  throughout the movie .  in fact ,  the whole movie pretty much follows this suit .  the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock .   ( i went to bed without viewing it ,  however )  .  to no surprise at all ,  i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later .
-1	the underground comedy movie ,  is possibly the worst train wrecks i've ever seen .  luckily i didn't pay for this movie ,  and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was .  i love off color comedy .  i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained .  no ,  instead the acting was so awful ,  the  " jokes "  were extremely cheesy ,  and the plot was no where to be found .  maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so i can't hold that against this movie .  it's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat .  .  .  .  . by batman .  .  . a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat .  hilarious .  simply genius .  i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it .  perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand .  or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean .   p . s .  don't buy this movie !
-1	sure ,  we all like bad movies at one time or another ,  and we in fact enjoy them ,  this however ,  wasn't even a guilty pleasure ,  it was just crap .  some guy ,  vince offer ,  who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high--probably both--and thought it was a great idea to make a movie .  he then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals .  overall ,  this movie was so bad ,  predictable ,  and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off .  it makes you got served look like citizen kane .  bat man ?  wtf .  .  . some guy that walks around with a bat ,  real original .  almost as good as calling him fat man ,  and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit .
-1	sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one .  you can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back .  i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension .  .  . why .  .  .  . he lent his name to this vermin .
-1	i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland .  it was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be .  the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers .   i kept thinking ,   " hey ,  there's a reason why boot camp is tough .  it's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit .  there's no room for cocky attitudes and men who won't follow orders .  "  i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers .  i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit .   --
-1	anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie .  i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 .  it looked like it could be funny ,  but i wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first .  i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster .   about a year and a half later ,  i was at tower records and in the  " dvds for less than $20 "  pile ,  there was a copy of this movie .  seeing that the dvd was only $6 . 99 i decided to buy it .  i got home ,  put the disc in the dvd player ,  and waited for the laughs to start .  .  . and i waited some more .  the laughs never came .   i'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible .  sick ,  desperately tasteless ,  and poorly written and directed ,  the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time .  no stars .
-1	the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i've ever seen .  i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase  " guaranteed to offend "  written on it .  .  .  meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh .   this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits ,  bad characters ,  and worse jokes .  .  .  from the pathetic bat-man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit ,  they just aren't funny .  the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between - watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin ,  for example - but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer's ineptness at comedy .   keep the underground comedy movie underground .  .  .  bury it !
-1	first of all .  .  .  .  .   what the hell ?  why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing ,  offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch .    what the crap is funny about a dog being injured ,  a grandma getting her head knocked off .  .  . a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom ?  what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick .  anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny ,  should not even be allowed to walk the earth .    but from what i hear its not even offensive .  .  . so .  .  . they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage .  .  . and they cant even pull that off .
-1	this movie goes beyond just being bad ,  it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .  unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film ,   ( if you can call it that )  .
-1	imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie .  now ,  imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity .  now imagine something 50 times worse .   got that ?   ok ,  now go see the underground comedy movie .  that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever .  ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen .  there were a few cheap laughs .  .  . very few .  but it was lame .  even if the intent of the movie was to be lame ,  it was too lame to be funny .   the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it .  he wasted his money .  vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why .
-1	words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is .  it is a series of random ,  unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady  ( really disturbing )  .  the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco ,  the best actor in this movie .  also ,  it is rated nc-17 ,  shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .
-1	i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru .  .  . not one laugh in it .  ok ,  maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big ,  black ,  bald gay virgin .  but the rest of it was shockingly un-funny .  on top of being void of any laughs the  " skits "  go on forever !  steer clear of this one if you value your time and money .  dreadful !  !  !  the worst !  !  !
-1	hawked as the most offensive movie ever ,  guaranteed to offend everyone- guess what ?  it worked ,  i'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this .  two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true .  curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us !  it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man .  i generally avoid the crappy ones ,  but got sucked into this one .  we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it ,  and his movie picking privileges have been revoked .  there is nothing remotely funny about this movie .  .  . even the  " adventures of dickman "  scene was sophomoric at best .  .  color me p***ed .  thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason .  .  . no .  . it just sucked .  never watch this !  for any reason whatsoever .  not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny .  that's saying alot .  please for the love of all that is holy ,  if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie .  it's many things- stupid ,  pointless ,  and worthless to name a few .  but the main thing it was aiming for :  offensively funny- it failed miserably .  crash and burn .  .  .  .
-1	how do i begin ?  this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen  . it has no redeemable qualities  . i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle . it failed to get even a single smile on my face . i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film .  i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor .  the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack ,  i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place . i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap .  i will leave you with this warning .  do not watch this film  , it sucks .
-1	since most review's of this film are of screening's seen decade's ago i'd like to add a more recent one ,  the film open's with stock footage of b-17's bombing germany ,  the film cut's to oskar werner's hauptmann  ( captain )  wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler's fuehrer bunker ,  once inside ,  they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel ,  the film then cut's to one of many conference scene's with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer's to  " ultimate victory "  while werner's character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen's are caught up in a fantasy world-some non-bunker event's are depicted ,  most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit's and his family's difficulty in surviving-this film suffer's from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 year's after ww2 should not have included ;  the actor portraying goebbels  ( willy krause )  wear's the same uniform as hitler ,  including arm eagle- goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband-the  " ss "  soldier's wear german army camouflage ,  the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy's of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker  ( it was done outside in the courtyard )  and lastly ,  hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922-most account's agree it was a walther ppk-some bit's of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable ,  this bit is shown as a cabaret skit ,  with a intoxicated wounded soldier  ( his arm in a splint )  maniacally goose-stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease/belly dance ,  all by candlelight .  .  .  this is actually embarrassing to watch-the most incredible bit is when werner's captain wust gain's an audience alone with skoda's hitler ,  hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench ,  drugged and delirious ,  when werner's character begin's to question him ,  hitler start's screaming which bring's in a ss guard who mortally wound's werner's character in the back with a gunshot-this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account-werner's character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare's his own ending ,  hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off-screen ,  the final second's of the movie show hitler's funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner/hauptmann wust-this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film's such as the 1973 remake  " hitler :  the last 10 day's "  or the german film  " downfall "   ( der untergang )  if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story ,  these last two film's are based on first person eyewitness account's ,  with  " hitler :  the last 10 day's "  being compiled from gerhard boldt's autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and  " downfall "  being done from hitler's secretary's recollection's ,  the screen play for  " der letzte akte "  is taken from american nuremberg war crime's trial judge michael musmanno's book  " ten day's to die "  ,  which is more a compilation of event's  ( many obviously fanciful )  than eyewitness history-it is surprising that hugh trevor roper's account ,  " the last day's of hitler "  was never made into a film .
-1	it really impresses me that it got made .  the director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality .  i can think of no other way itd pass script stage .  what i want you to consider is this .  .  . while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors .  it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there ,  not enjoying it ,  just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying .  id really like to know what the budget is ,  guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor .  i want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me' .  but the reality is for them to appeal to you ,  you'd have to be the man who wrote them .  or a retard .  so imagine that in script form .  .  . and this guy got that green lit .  thats impressive isn't it ?
-1	this movie shows a row of sketches ,  which partly pass over into one another .  i realized the passing over late in the movie ,  at first it only irritated me .    many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact ,  using absurdity and obscenity .  the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails .   my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie  ( my god ,  it hurts in my head every time i call it  " movie "  )  :  a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great .  but it failed .  at least the director made something out of nothing .  but it isn't something good .   many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned ,  but this one tops them all .  it's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making .  no .  to correct myself ,  it's even worse than that .  a movie with gags so bad ,  that they aren't funny at all .  it's not even fun to watch the lead-actor ,  writer and director  ( all three the same guy by the way )  perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies .  the movie is too bad for that .
-1	this film stars ,  among others ,   " slapchop "  vince offer  ( who also wrote ,  edited and directed )  and joey buttafuoco--not exactly names that scream out  " quality "  .  and with such uplifting skits as  " supermodels taking a dump "   ( it's exactly what it sounds like )  ,  a guy who robs a sperm bank  ( the  " rhymer "  )  ,  necrophilia with a rotting corpse ,  black market fetuses  ( featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar )  ,  lots and lots of gay jokes ,  a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions .  the skits are painfully unfunny  ( such as  " batman and rhymer "  )  ,  the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude .  .  . and stupid .  i truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget .   apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by  " slap shot "  vince against the scientologists .  frankly ,  i wouldn't know who to root for in this case !  !  !  apparently ,  he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film .  no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny  ( by comparison ,  ebola is funnier )  .  .  . and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie .   by the way ,  that is bobby lee  ( from  " mad tv "  )  wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film .  it's amazing his career could overcome this .
-1	lately they have been trying to hock this film late-night on cable tv commercials .  don't believe the hype .  i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres .  this is ,  in my opinion ,  the 3rd worst movie of all time ,  just behind mac & me  ( #1 worst )  ,  and jack frost  ( #2 worst )  ,  but i must admit ,  they are all close and all terrible !  really ,  nothing of this movie is funny ,  or disturbing ,  or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money .  the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy .  i'm not lying about that .  someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film .  it is that awful .  if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this ,  which i doubt you can finish .  two thumbs enthusiastically down .
-1	i bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central .  i was actually really looking forward to watching this .  my god where did i go wrong ?  now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies ,  hell i own over 1 , 500 dvd's !  with that said ,  the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen .  i tried to give it a chance ,  but not only was it not funny .  it had no point ,  did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid .  god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny ?  this is going right to the bottom of the bin .  .  .
-1	i rated this movie as awful  ( 1 )  .  after watching the trailer ,  i thought this movie could be pretty cool .   " guaranteed to offend .  .  . everyone !  "  the trailer said .  well .  .  . it did offend me ,  because this movie really sucks .  it is hardly a comedy ,  as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie .  and what's with all the gays in this movie ?  i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are ,  but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie ,  when these scenes are absolutely not funny ?  i guess the director is a gay man in denial ,  or something like that .   so my advice to you is :  if you want to waste good money ,  go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times ,  you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy's .  it really is total crap .
-1	this movie doesn't even deserve a one .  this was an utter waste of time .  it was a waste of film and money .  it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting .  my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone .  there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language .  but not only that ,  there is no plot line ,  the actors are terrible ,  the accents are horrible ,  the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie !    the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt  ( who got only a fifteen second part ,  by the way )  .  i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times ,  adding only a new sentence .   a film similar to this is eraser head ,  possibly the most disturbing movie in existence .  there is no plot line ,  and is not funny .  although it isn't trying to be funny .  do not watch either movie .
-1	a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day .  not as mind-numbingly awful as say  " freddy got fingered "  or  " lost reality "  ,  but that in no way is an endorsement in any way ,  sense or form .  features the worst rhyming clown ever .  any most if it isn't offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct .  it also has the worst song parody ever put on film ,  the worst arnold impersonation ever  ( not just the worst put on film ,  literally the worst ever )  .  i have no clue why karen black ,  micheal clarke duncan ,  or slash would star in this  ( the reasons i watched this in the first place )  the only thing mildly amusing was dickman .  in conclusion i would't recommend this film to anyone ,  but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic .  do something notable with you lives people .  plus if it's true the church of scientalogy hates him ,  he can't be all bad .   my grade :  d
-1	and i repeat ,  please do not see this movie !  this is more than a review .  this is a warning .  this sets the record for the worst ,  most effortless comedy ever made .  at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays ,  the gags are crude and flat ,  but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny .  i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos :  everyone thinks they can do comedy ,  and only 10 percent of them are right .  comedy is hard !  this is not some genre any fool can play around with .  i think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to  " kentucky fried movie .  "  basically ,  these bozos are comparing their so-called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers .  come on ,  i've seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than  " the underground comedy movie .  "  here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie :  one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d**kman .  the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen .  that's it .  that's the whole joke .  wow .  this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes .  another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie .  and in another sketch ,  there's a bag lady beauty contest ,  in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini-clad middle-aged women with beer guts and stretch marks .  plus ,  making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny .  it's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped .  the whole movie is supposed to be a satire .  i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire .  .  . is truth !  !  !  for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap ,  explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags !  some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper ,  but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper ,  it probably won't be funny on screen .  if i tell someone about a big ,  black ,  muscular gay virgin ,  who's saving himself for the right man ,  he or she would probably laugh .  but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag .  i hate how whenever people criticize a low-brow comedy like this for not being funny ,  they're regarded as stuck-up squares .  i just saw  " white chicks "  recently .  that's another low-brow ,  politically incorrect comedy ,  but i laughed my head off .  the most offensive thing about  " the underground comedy movie "  is it's not funny !  what the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work .  there has to be more !  just think of the famous scene from  " there's something about mary "   ( ironically ,  enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list )  .  the joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids .  there was a buildup .  ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a  " loaded gun .  "  then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released .  a knock is on the door ,  and he has to answer it .  his date ,  mary ,  is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off ben's ear .  in this movie ,  there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people ,  with no buildup whatsoever .  as jay leno always says ,   " this comedy thing's not so easy ,  is it ?  "  keep that in mind ,  vince offer ,  'cause you weren't cut out for this genre !  !  the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip .  let's face it ,  nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect .  i know comedy is subjective .  .  . but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody ,  except maybe the filmmakers themselves .  as a side note ,  the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan's fame in movies like  " armageddon "  and  " the green mile .  "  there can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show .  all the others in the cast are either non-actors ,  has-been actors or b-movie stars .  karen black made a good impression in  " five easy pieces ,  "  but i don't think she's done anything of value ever since .  slash was probably drugged into being in this film .  gina lee nolin is nothing without  " baywatch .  "  angelyne is the film's biggest star  ( keeping in mind duncan wasn't famous at the time )  ,  and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her--for good reason .  usually ,  i'm in support of extremely low-budget flicks ,  but this one deserves to drift into obscurity .  i hope to lord this doesn't become a cult classic !  shouldn't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?
-1	i'm into bad movies but this has nothing going for it .  despite what the morons above have said ,  it is not funny .  i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director / writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again !  to love movies and comedy is to despise this film .  i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was .  if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here .  zero !  if you need to compare underground movies ,  see  " kentucky fried movie "  or early john waters .  the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire .  the rule for comedy is this  .  .  .  if it's funny you can say or do anything but if it's not funny you are not satirical ,  you are not edgy ,  you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny .  zero !
-1	this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie .  this installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke ,  but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny .   there's almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert  ( and lots of people watching on  " free tv " --since when does that happen ?  )  surely the script writer could have done something more creative ;  look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation .  not in this film ,  which pretty much ended the bill & ted franchise .  the joke was over .   the grim reaper is tossed into the mix ,  for whatever reason .  this infusion ,  like the whole plot ,  is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement .  there's a zz top impression ,  hammered in for no reason .  there's lights ,  smoke ,  mirrors ,  noise .  but nothing really creative or funny .   skip this bogus thing .
-1	this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life .  this is saying quite a bit ,  considering some of the choices i've made in film rentals .   i got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it .  the topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender .   the  " skits "  are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags ,  and it's such a blatant  ( and poor )  rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of  " vince offer "   ( whoever that is )  .   unless you are a masochist ,  avoid this pile of rubbish .
-1	i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago ,  and said to myself ,   " seems funny ,  plus it has michael clarke duncan ,  how can i lose !  "  i proceeded to pay $15 . 99 plus tax for it .  i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted .  wooden performances abound .  all the  " hilarious "  and  " outstanding "  performances promised never seemed to arrive .  after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame ,  knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $15 . 99 back .  i literally almost cried as well ,  because if that was what could be considered  " comedy "  i didn't want to believe in movies anymore .  my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was .  over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone .  this was my next horrible mistake ,  because as i watched i just became angry .  i began to yell at the movie ,  and i'm not one to talk to movies period .  everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen .  my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends ,  but that could not save this movie even .  the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding .  the fact that its rating  ( at the time of this writing )  is 3 . 6 is a crime against humanity .
-1	imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie .  now ,  imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity .  now imagine something 50 times worse .   got that ?   ok ,  now go see the underground comedy movie .  that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever .  ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen .  there were a few cheap laughs .  .  . very few .  but it was lame .  even if the intent of the movie was to be lame ,  it was too lame to be funny .   the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it .  he wasted his money .  vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's no surprise why .
-1	a woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive . the cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement . of course b-horror movie queen brinke stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature . the only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is michael berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with delia sheppard . and the last twenty minutes of brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch . the special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful . better watch  " scalps "  or  " alien dead "  again . of course i ain't expecting classy entertainment from fred olen ray , but  " haunting fear "  is too dull to be enjoyable .
-1	i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental ,  thinking that the cover looked quite nice .  and it was nice ,  but the movie is trash .  i can handle b-grade ,  i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp  ( ie .  'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be )  ,  but this was just bland bland bland .  incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences .  this movie has very little to offer .
-1	fred olen ray is a lousy director ,  even as far as b movie directors go ,  but 'haunting fear' is probably one of his better films .  yes ,  it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial' and yes ,  it is badly paced and uneven throughout ,  but it is also pretty entertaining .  scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty ,  fragile housewife whose worthless husband  ( jay richardson )  is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster  ( played by robert quarry )  .  delia sheppard ,  a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies ,  actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress .  you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic ,  robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes .  the ending didn't make much sense !
-1	i have this film out of the library right now and i haven't finished watching it .  it is so bad i am in disbelief .  audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then ,  although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'robin and marian . ' this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film .  it's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide .   there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies .  little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest ,  palest shadow .   who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'breakfast at tiffany's' twenty years earlier ?  the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you .   'reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down ,  i guess .  in this case ,  audrey hepburn's chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star .  here she has even lost her talent as a star .  if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period ,  like ann-margret ,  had played the role ,  there would have been some life in it ,  even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid-level situations .   hepburn was a great person ,  of course ,  greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being ,  and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors .  after this dreadful performance ,  she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called 'love among thieves . ' in 'they all laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's .  even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn .  turner took acting seriously even when she was bad .  hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all ,  couldn't be bothered with it ;  even her hair and clothes look tacky .  her last really good work was in 'two for the road , ' perhaps her most perfect ,  if possibly not her best in many ways .   and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening .  john ritter is horrible ,  there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten ,  who was truly pretty .  otherwise ,  critic david thomson's oft-used phrase 'losing his/her talent' never has made more sense .   ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then ,  and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn--who could ask for anything less ?  sandra dee's last ,  pitiful film 'lost , ' from 2 years later ,  a low-budget nothing ,  had more to it than this .  at least ms .  dee spoke in her own voice ;  by 1981 ,  audrey hepburn's accent just sounded silly ;  she'd go on to do the pbs 'gardens of the world with audrey hepburn' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what i like most is when flowers go back to nature ! ' as in naturalized daffodils ,  but in an actual fictional movie ,  she just sounds ridiculous .   to think that 'breakfast at tiffany's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world--she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'my fair lady' ,  matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in 'last year at marienbad . ' and then this !  and her final brief role as the angel 'hap' in the spielberg film 'always' was just more of the lady stuff--corny ,  witless and stifling .   i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church ,  a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the shaker hymn 'simple gifts . ' the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn's singing 'moon river' on the fire escape in 'breakfast at tiffany's , ' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation .   a great lady who was once a fine actress  ( as in 'the nun's story' )  and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one--that's not all that common .  and perhaps it is only a great human being who ,  in making such things as film performances trivial ,  nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance .  most of the talk about hepburn's miscasting is about 'my fair lady . ' but the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'wait until dark , ' which had starred lee remick on broadway .  never as celebrated as hepburn ,  she was a better actress in many ways  ( hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid )  ,  although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part .  after that ,  all of her acting went downhill .
-1	first off .  .  . with names like fred olen ray ,  brinke stevens and jan-michael vincent ,  plus distributors like  " rhino "  and  " troma "  on the video box ,  you know what you're getting into with this one .  b movie mania !  if you're actually expecting to see a thriller  " based on edgar allan poe ,  "  then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films .  this is pure ,  unadulterated sleaze  ( with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to  " the premature burial "  )  ,  complete with lots of r-rated ,  ready-for-video sex and nudity .  however ,  it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way .  .  .   brinke  ( who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes )  plays rich ,  traumatized ,  insomniac housewife victoria monroe ,  whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father  ( hoke howell )  .  her worthless husband terry  ( jay richardson )  has racked up some serious gambling debt  ( owed to a gangster played by robert quarry )  and ,  with help from his kinky ,  blonde ,  european-accented sexpot secretary lisa  ( delia sheppard )  plots to do away with brinke for her money .  name-value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist  ( she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this )  ,  50s sci-fi/horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living vicki .  jan-michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home .   the kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before ,  the ending is an unintentional laugh riot  ( concluding with a direct rip-off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror )  and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit .  brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic ,  but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role .  she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here .
-1	hallam foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of oedepus complex afterward .   it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten .  there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops ,  and habits in a church tower like quasimodo  ( only he is much less sympathetic )  .   there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything .  she happens to look like his mother ,  yes so what ?  we know he misses his mother ,  that's what the first ten minutes were about .  they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o . k .  short film .  now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change .  he is a guy that stuff happens to .  the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job .   there's this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character .  he paints his face ,  dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead badger on his head .  a badger !  you've got to see the ending !  he returns to his home with the badger on his head  ( and it is shot like a tacky horror film )  to kill his dad's new wife  ( which he had sex with in the beginning )  .  and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background .  i've got to admit though ,  i'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose .  it feels like this mackenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school .  you are so smart !  thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories !  you really dug !  what a wallraff !  okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book ,  but anyway .  .   photowise it is boring .  a lot of talking heads .  plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene ,  you know cold and warm etc .  .  why ?  maybe  " hallam foe "  is both a feature and a test film for color blind people .  or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely ,  so they increased blue so that we really get it .   i'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation .  and all the  " cute "  sex stuff going on .  this whole film is an independent cliché .  but i do recommend it .  i laughed more than a few times .  though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine .
-1	in its way ,  mister foe  ( originally ,  and more appropriately ,  titled hallam foe  i can't see addressing its title character as  " mister "  )  ,  is a tribute to good acting .  both jamie bell ,  as hallam ,  a physically attractive voyeur/creep ,  and sophia myles ,  as kate ,  his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance ,  are convincing .  the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life .  a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp .  and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police .   these things are not ,  however ,  what happens in the movie .  poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair .  hallam ,  of course ,  hates his stepmother and lets he know it .  she has sex with him .  kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games .  she looks like his birth mother .  it all ends happily with hallam  " resolving "  his  " issues "  .   forty some years ago ,  the play and brilliantly acted movie ,  who's afraid of virginia woolf ,  had a similarly optimistic ending ,  with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart .  the trouble is ,  it doesn't always work that way ,  especially when nobody really cares .  in virginia woolf ,  the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation .  in mister foe ,  the emotional revelation never really happens .
-1	david mackenzie's follow-up to the brilliant young adam wants to be a feel-good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho-sexual issues with his dead mother .  it wants to be gritty ,  realistic ,  and mysterious .  at the same time ,  it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult .   to meet this end ,  the film tries hard to be youthful .  its poster has hand-drawn letters looking like that of juno .  its original soundtrack is comprised of fast-paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that hallam is ok ;  just a little misguided .  but strangely the film is anything but youthful .   like young adam this film's central mystery concerns a drowned woman- in this case hallam's mother .  young adam keeps its mystery quiet ,  contemplative ,  and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come .  hallam foe does the opposite .  it foregrounds its character's psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters .  the opening scene is hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend .  hallam swiftly interrupts ,  asserting his presence in the household .  here we see everything that hallam will do for the rest of the movie .   the mystery surrounding his mother's drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father's girlfriend .  the audience can never really trust hallam because ,  besides being creepy ,  we think his obsession has led him close to insanity .  this hindered the mystery element for me because hallam is too sporadic to be relatable .  right when he's found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home ,  at first it appearing to be looking for the police .  then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother ,  which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element .   while jamie bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character ,  he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs .  this movie is in no way mysterious ,  yet it is not blunt either .  it tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues ,  but it adds a very self-conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite .  it goes for a soundtrack-heavy ,  trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings ,  picks locks ,  and camps out for the sake of voyeurism .  these urban peeping tom adventures hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward-drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy ,  giddy ,  or pleasant .  they are more neutral than anything ;  not propelling the character or story .  mackenzie makes you understand hallam ,  yet he fails to build common ground .   he expects you to enjoy hallam's trials and tribulations without much ideological justification .  the film hinges on its audience's perspective on voyeurism/the kind of person who engages in it .  obviously ,  most people would be disgusted by it .  and hallam foe realizes that ,  but it does not let us see hallam weigh the morality of his decisions .  he goes from person to person ,  trying to fill his deep void .  there is a particularly disturbing line from hallam's love interest kate where she drunkenly says  " i love creepy boys ,  "  perhaps asking the audience to do the same .  the line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him  ( her motivation remains vague throughout )  and tries to further us from judging him .  it's not hard to like hallam ,  but it is very hard to participate in his adventure- if it is even an adventure at all .  all the while ,  the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood .   great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act ,  muddy development ,  and needlessly ambiguous direction from mackenzie .  recently this film was re-named for a us release ,  and for what reason ?  not only is it more unappealing ,  but the hard truth is that the hallam character never earns the title 'mister . '
-1	first off ,  i must admit that both films i've seen by this director i saw without titles and so may have missed the points .  my czech isn't bad but ,  having sat through two of his films ,  i wish i hadn't even tried to learn .  samotari is too cool .  way too cool .  it's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together .  that's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of prague  ( tiny ,  really .  )  the main characters are between 20 and 30 .  they've got jobs and only one studies .  the best character is the young balkan girl .  her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day .  that's about it .  the only great character .  everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own .  how can i sympathise with such obvious incompetence ?  perhaps there are interesting bits with japanese tourists but do i need another stereotype in film ?  if you like alright music ,  see this film .  if you want to laugh at others' stupidity ,  see this film .  if you like irony and dry humor ,  see an original jarmusch not an imitation .  and under no circumstances see ondricek's film ,  septej  ( whisper .  )  that is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes .
-1	i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee .  but then ,  in poland in 2000 ,  i watched it in a complete form .  and so what ?  the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong ,  straight and fundamentally severe ladies .  the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive ,  constant masculine desire for sex ,  feminists who are shown like complete idiots  ( you may agree with them or not ,  but idiots certainly they are not )  ,  and so on .  the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like  " i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i haven't done anything to her !  "  .  this was intended to be a comedy ,  instead ,  it turned out to be a vapid farce ,  full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos .  do not waste your time on it - this is just bad .
-1	once again i have seen a movie made by people that know nothing .  i just recently reviewed baby face nelson .  now i've seen dillinger and i've had it .   this movie is garbage .  i don't know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like bonnie and clyde .  this movie is far from a classic .  someone called it brilliant .  that's an insane thing to say .  this movie can't get any facts straight and it has the worst casting i've ever seen .  i don't know whose dumb idea it was to cast warren oates as john dillinger .  first of all he looks nothing like him .  second of all ,  by the time john dillinger was killed he was 31 .  when oates made this he was 45 !  you could even tell that he's older than the real dillinger just by looking at him .  not only was he too old ,  but so was ben johnson as melvin purvis .   they show baby face nelson die ,  then homer van meter ,  and finally john dillinger .  john dillinger was killed before both of them .  the last one to die out of the three was baby face nelson .  not only do the writers not know when they died ,  but they also don't know how they died .  baby face nelson was not killed after he escaped from little bohemia in a robe .  homer van meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns .  homer van meter was cornered by the police in st .  paul and gunned down with machine guns .  another member of dillinger's gang ,  harry pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie .  pierpont wasn't shot .  harry pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair .  i go into what happened to baby face nelson on my baby face nelson review so i'm not going to go into it again here .  let me also add that richard dreyfuss' portrayal of baby face nelson is pathetic .  there's a scene where he attacks dillinger and then gets a bad beating .  while dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming ,   " leave me alone !  "  baby face nelson and john dillinger never fought .  maybe dillinger didn't agree with nelson's bank robbing methods ,  but they never fought .  nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten .  they keep calling him lester  " baby face "  nelson .  he was never in his life known by that name .  nelson's real name was lester gillis and he changed his name to george nelson .  the black guy that escaped from jail with dillinger was herbert youngblood ,  but in this movie he is known as reed youngblood .  john milius doesn't know anything .  where the hell did john milius get his information ?  i could probably make a better movie than him .   finally the way they showed john dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable .  the movie shows dillinger walk out of the biograph with the lady in red and his girlfriend billie frechette .  by the way ,  billie frechette wasn't even there that night .  but a girl named polly hamilton was .  melvin purvis yells ,  'johnny ! ' dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell .  it is a proved fact that dillinger did not have a gun that night .  the fbi gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away .  they didn't even have to shoot him .  they were so close that powder burns were found on his face .  it was murder .  they also say that the man killed that night was not john dillinger .  after killing tons of civilians in the little bohemia incident can you imagine the fbi reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man ?  the gun they had on display that was supposedly on dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after dillinger's death .  i could go on and on how the man they killed wasn't john dillinger ,  but i'll stop here .  if you would like to know more check it out here  see the dillinger version with lawrence tierney if you want ,  but don't waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie .
-1	i just finished reading a book about dillinger .  this movie was horribly inaccurate .  it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up .  his robberies and getaways were well planned ,  down to the second - when the time was up ,  they left whether they had all of the money or not .  they had notes of every road ,  where to turn ,  etc .  purvis never saw him at the restaurant ,  he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left .  purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed ,  only photos of him .  the way his gang members died were fictitious .  dillinger never robbed a bank by himself ,  like he did in this movie .  if i had never read the book ,  maybe i could have enjoyed the movie .  the acting was a bit over the top in places .  the action was overdone as well .  on second thought ,  i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book .
-1	proof why hollywood conventions are in place .  stale dialogue ,  underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe .  an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap-together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde  ( 1967 )  and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid  ( 1969 ) - truly innovative filmmakers and films - but falling well below the bar .  problems with storylines being self-explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections .  the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically .  unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor .  stills ,  black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can't transition well or to replace scenes that just didn't work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid  ( 1969 )  .   overly dramatic pauses between sentences ,  random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn't needed for storytelling plus over-the-top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980's - i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post-production .  the playing of music in most two shots and close-ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score .  no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots ,  doors ,  footsteps and dialogue  ( a style used in the late 60's through the mid-70's by new directors )  but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial - particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads .  in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no 'likeable' characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story .  neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the 'hero'- a necessity for any story to work for me .  we know from penn's and hill's movies who the 'heroes' are .  even though they are criminals ,  we like them and want to see them get away .  i could care less who was on the screen in this film .  i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non-historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger's life from june 1933 to july 1934  ( his death )  .   to be fair ,  there are some moments of good solid storytelling ,  which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits .  john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn't seem to try to 'copy' other filmmakers .  dillinger  ( 1973 )  isn't a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial 'big budget' debut ,  but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .
-1	near the beginning ,  after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger  ( warren oates )  ,  is an egomaniacal rapist ,  another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi .  second-in-command melvin purvis  ( ben johnson )  ,  surveys the situations ,  sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth ,  picks up two loaded  . 45-caliber automatics ,  and stalks off into the distant house alone .  bang ,  bang ,  bang .  purvis emerges alone from the house ,  carrying the female hostage ,  the miscreant dead .  all in long shot .   if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood ,  this should have considerable appeal .   oh ,  it's as exciting as it is mindless .  pretty boy floyd meets his demise dramatically .  multiple violations of the civic code .  plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and pistols .  blood all over .   as history ,  it stinks .  few remember melvin purvis as an fbi hero ,  partly ,  i would guess ,  because of his name .  melvin purvis ?  we all remember j .  edgar hoover ,  who fired melvin purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though .   the picture was written and directed by john milius .  he's the guy who had it written into his contract that ,  should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions ,  he should be the designated shooter .  milius is the guy ,  a compleat gun freak ,  who had teddy roosevelt's rough riders in the spanish-american war shouting quotations from henry v --  " saint crispin's day "  and all that .   exciting ,  yes ,  and complete garbage .   " i knew i'd never take him alive ,  and i didn't try too hard neither .  "  that is ,  kill 'em all and let god sort them out .   you'll just love it .
-1	anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s ,  60s ,  and 70s ,  must have seen a film or two by american international pictures ,  a distributor that resembled 1980s giant cannon films .  wherever movie-goers ventured ,  aip would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like 'voodoo woman' and 'the undead ; ' in the 60s were frankie avalon-annette funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory stompers ; ' and into the 70s ,  aip churned out grindhouse-level trash like 'cannibal girls' and 'sugar hill . '  'dillinger , ' released in 1973 ,  is one of the more 'highbrow' aip efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making ;  it is one of those uneven ,  over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment ,  craftsmanship and common sense be damned .  on the whole ,  'dillinger' is typical for its era :  entertaining and worth a couple of hours ,  but certainly not memorable .  heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact ,  'dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director john milius  ( 'magnum force' )  but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career .   the 109-minute 'dillinger' - epic for aip's scope - follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis ,  played by academy award winner ben johnson .  purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice .  at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout ,  including expert bankrobber john dillinger  ( warren oates )  ,  pretty boy floyd  ( steve kanaly )  ,  and psychopath baby face nelson  ( richard dreyfuss )  .  dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson ,  taking along homer van meter  ( harry dean stanton )  and harry pierpont  ( geoffrey lewis )  .  he also hooked up with billie frechette  ( michelle phillips )  ,  a prostitute of french and indian extraction .  while taking place over several months in 1933-4 ,  'dillinger' is basically a chase film ,  with purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j .  edgar hoover .   'dillinger' has a documentary feel ,  listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis .  milius keeps an honest depression look ,  using authentic fashion ,  cars ,  weapons ,  and buildings ;  he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts .  the film is never boring ,  moving at a quick ,  if haphazard ,  pace .  the action scenes are dillinger's strongpoint ,  edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort .  thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film ,  not to mention pounds of explosives .  this film is certainly not for the squeamish ,  with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place .  the violence ,  while gratuitous ,  brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life .   this film never transcends its exploitation status ,  however ,  because the needed writing just isn't there .  john milius ,  somewhat overrated as a filmmaker ,  places way too much emphasis on action .  the action scenes  ( mostly blood-filled shootouts )  are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era ,  including 1967's 'bonnie and clyde . ' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people ;  the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon ,  with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward .  melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline ,  becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling .  all too often ,  the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail .   aside from this ,  the picture's main crime is ignorance of historical fact .  while many say that 'dillinger' is just a film ,  it's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent .  those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die ,  as milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe .  in fact ,  dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter ;  he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death ,  nor did he have billie frechette in tow .  while these inaccuracies might make for high drama ,  there is no reason why milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them .   warren oates's performance as dillinger is quite good ,  although he sometimes looks unconvincing .  oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the american press ;  however ,  we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime .  ben johnson gives some life to purvis ,  suave but rather flat .  michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it's really too bad that milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger .  we never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer ,  other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger .  the supporting roles with kanaly ,  dreyfuss ,  stanton ,  lewis ,  and a briefly-appearing cloris leachman ,  are acceptable for such talent .   as a piece of 1970s exploitation ,  'dillinger' appears doomed to retail bargain bins ,  which is exactly where i picked up mgm's dvd release for $4 . 99 .  the film is nicely presented in widescreen  ( a must for drive-in flicks )  with subtitles in french and spanish .  dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra .  largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts ,  the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material .  for fans of the genre ,  it's certainly worth checking out .   ** out of 4  roving reviewer - www . geocities . com/paul_johnr
-1	i recently watched this film at the 30'th gothenburg film festival ,  and to be honest it was on of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to watch .  don't get me wrong ,  there are the funny and entertaining bad films  ( e . g  " manos  hands of fate "  )  and then there are the awful bad films .   ( this one falls into the latter category )  .  the cinematography was unbelievable ,  and not in a good way .  it felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus  ( with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot )  ,  the lighting was something between  " one guy running around with a light bulb "  and  " non existing "  .  the actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors ,  and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them .  the only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer ,  a classic look a la jason vorhees from  " friday the 13'th "  .  the plot was extremely poor ,  and the ending even worse .  i would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like ,  or maybe an insomniac needing sleep .
-1	it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film .  but the problem is that it's not very good .  there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented ,  the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them .   rather bland  ( and sometimes downright bad )  photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it .  it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films .  but alas ,  that is what one must do .  on its own ,  it's not very good .  and compared to others ,  it's still not very good .  but it is not without its good points !  i liked the plot .  it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end .  sometimes in the really dark scenes ,  it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well .   however in the end the film fails to impress .  the characters are pretty much non-existent and we don't care for any of them .  any of them might die ,  but it's possible to pinpoint the final  " survivor "  from very early on .
-1	" i love new york "  is another entry by vh-1  ( mtv networks )  showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill ,  obnoxious ,  woman .  it must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest ,  ebonics speaking ,  craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network .  many will argue ,   " this is a show "  .  true ,  it's not as bad as it's previous show ,   " flavor of love "  - but it's just as bad .   it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show  " in living color "  where keenan ivory wayans was imitating the boxer mike tyson on  " the love connection "  dating show and he picked  " robin givens "  for a date .  mike talked of how the date was okay ,  but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in .  this show reminds me of that .   the men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more -  ( i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto ,  you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv .  )  but these are professional reality actors ,  so why bother .   it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this .  the fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions ?  15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network ?   ( well ,  you can't hate them for trying to make a buck .  )  maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour ?  or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the wwf !  any way you slice it ,  it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil .   no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck ,  or any different from any of the others .  appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an  " end "  to reality shows ,  this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end ,  immediately .
-1	the latest rumor going around is that vh1 is starting casting calls for i love new york 3 mid 2008 .  so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the winner ?   i know flavor of love is coming up to it's 3rd season ,  so now with a flavor of love 3 and a i love new york 3 .  .  .  .  . will there ever be a true winner ?  ?  ?   i've also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the 3rd season of i love new york !  !  !  !  i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love 3 .    hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york 2 .  .  .  . i'm just stating the latest rumor .
-1	i think that new york is a big fake ,  i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid .  i enjoyed flavor fl av more better ,  she acts like a slut ,  and a hoe put together .  her mother is out of this world ,  i think she is the devils daughter .  i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl .  she is nasty ,  spoiled and a big fat fake . the show is very interesting to watch ,  how much money is she getting to do this awful show ,  and whats up with her mother , i thought her and new york did not get along ,  but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter . and where is the so called husband ,  he is no where to be found , i would not to be with them either .
-1	as a young black/latina woman i am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me .  of course when i saw this movie at the video store i thought i would enjoy it ;  unfortunately ,  i didn't .  although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant ,  the story was simply not properly developed .  the movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film .  had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes ,  perhaps i would have enjoyed it a bit more .  honestly ,  i would recommend a film like  " raising victor "  over this one any day .  i just was not too impressed .
-1	this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through .  the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief ,  housedress ,  and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon ,  lying on the couch eating bonbons .  in fact ,  bonbons play a prominent role in the movie .   the only reason i was able to watch to the end ,  is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene .  in most of his films ,  he moves too fast to get a good look .  the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality - more italian than mexican ,  really .    the dialog is as stiff as wood .  unfortunately ,  no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect-mannered and mild .  the aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills .  what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican ?  this is a fairy story .   i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for .  the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women's day magazine .  i didn't see his name listed ,  but the art director surely was thomas kinkade ,  who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias .  this film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses .  if you like dreamy pink and blue sky ,  this film is for you !   ( the bonbons looked really good ,  too !  )
-1	it must be the most corniest tv show on the air .  this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies .  his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother .  i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use .  jim has got to retire or something .  please let them go of the air .  if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush .  id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing .  i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running .  we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see jim's face .  in conclusion ,  no more please .
-1	i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman .  it is great !  when jim tosses that little person through the window ,  the look on his face is priceless .  then when he starts to address the priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the pee-woman ?  great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see .  i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode .  i'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious .  does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman ?  can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo ?
-1	i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because jim belushi was involved in it ,  and heavily .  but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred .  after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow .  now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote ,  or even to the tv to turn the channel .  but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state ?   " nuts to that "  ,  i said .  so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me .  what fate had in store was an episode of this show ,  an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad ,  general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with ,  and once again i was completely right !  this show is a total crud-pie !  belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn .  the women are physically attractive but too stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer .  there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell .    except .  .    except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell ,  america's greatest comic character actor .  this guy plays belushi's brother-in-law ,  andy ,  and he is gold .  how good is he really ?  well ,  aside from being funny ,  his job is to make belushi look good .  that's like trying to make butt warts look good .  but campbell pulls it off with style .  someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year .  without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne-smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage .  5 stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in !
-1	all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father ,  a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish .  how can that be funny ?  of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed ,  but jim's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner .   and why it that ?  my guess is that it's because  " he should now better "  .  jim's not a stupid guy ,  he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so .  but he chooses not to .  it's a conscious choice he makes ,  when he chooses to not play with his kids ,  not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy  " lady products "  and it's a choice he makes ,  when he puts down his relatives .   the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to .  if the cheryl character was a real person ,  she would have left him years ago ,  and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years .  but alas ,  she's just a catalyst for jim's quirky middle-class extreme selfishness .
-1	you need to watch this show once to have seen them all ,  the formula is exactly the same in each episode .  jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife ,  at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her ,  she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully .  in fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that i'll take a stab at one now .   episode 'valentines pay'  jims wife notices that all of jims weekly pay has disappeared ,  he then explains to her he lost it at the casino .  she screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is .  then on valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball  ( hence explaining the missing wages )  .  she realizes 'her' mistake and the usual 'oh jim ,  you're so lovely' .   .  . the end  another very obvious item is the fact that jims character is based on homer simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant ,  when this is attempted with human beings it does not work and jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk .    imo the only reason that this is successful is simply because we're so many now in terms of human beings with tvs ,  these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you'd get an audience .   'two and a half men' on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious .
-1	the show is average .  it doesn't make me laugh particularly .  however ,  i think courtney really brings it down .  she doesn't look natural .  she has these three ways to talk ,  all robotic .  she talks quietly  ( with no intonation )  ,  she talks normally  ( with no intonation )  ,  or she does that thing where she starts talking normally ,  and starts yelling gradually .  however ,  her yelling is like  " let's pretend i'm yelling because i shouldn't be too loud on the set "  .    she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing .  it's annoying .  you can't really get her personality ,  because she doesn't really produce emotion ,  and doesn't get upset .  she has this husband ,  who's doing all these stupid things ,  and there is no reaction from her .  very dry and plain acting .
-1	this is one of the worst-written movies i've ever had to sit through .   the story's nothing new -- but it's a cartoon ,  so who cares ,  as long as it's pretty and fun ?    i'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations ,  or i'll be here all day  ( except to say that there aren't any ;  the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot )  ,  but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper .  thumbs down ?  i'd vote to cut their thumbs off .    " narrow in on an object/prop .  cut back to character close-up .  character gives a knowing look ,  which the audience will not even remotely understand .  repeat that several times ,  with different objects/props .  "    " make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around ,  crashing into each other ,  generally raining destruction all over ,  and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless-looking ,  almost pastoral green rock in the distance .  "    the whole thing is a long succession of events ,  actions ,  and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer ,  to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly .   this is the plan 9 of cg cartoons ,  except that it doesn't have ed wood groan factor to make it fun to watch .   do yourselves a favour :  spend your cartoon budget on pixar movies .
-1	i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it's banality , but it is usual in every way . it has the dumb husband , his smarter but boring and conventional wife ,  along with the idiotic sidekick for  " comic "  relief-it sorely needs it . stale predictable jokes ,  with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack ,  punctuate this noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill ,  or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma .  but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly identify . a  " regular "  guy just like you and me . i live in the southern u . s ,  so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism . down here ,  that obnoxious character is everywhere ,  in some form or another . seeing him on television is brutal overkill .
-1	this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw ?  the beginning is somewhat good ,  but the end ?  i still don't even get it !  magical power ,  300 years later ,  goddess ,  dancing what the f*** is that about ?  ?  ?  the acting is somewhat not so bad .  .  but some place i could do better for sure !
-1	shown in australia as 'hydrosphere' ,  this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end ,  just to see if it could get any worse .  .  .  and it does !  the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class ,  the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures ,  and the acting is wooden .   the infant 'muppet' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of 'total recall' .  there didn't seem to be a single ,  original idea in the whole movie .   i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through .   malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame .  he obviously needed the money !
-1	this movie is absolutely pointless ,  one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange .  this one may be one of the worst though .  no story ,  crappy special effects ,  shot in 4 : 3/or even worse cropped on dvd ,  just avoid it  .  .  .  .
-1	this is probably one of the worst movies ever made .  bad acting ,  bad special effects ,  bad plot ,  bad everything .  in the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which muddles everything .  malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill .  i just don " t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning .  i could have done better special effects in my bathtub .  there's no continuity .  the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad .  acting .  do they have to smoke to be bad .  ?  the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets ,  make up your mind .  the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing .  whay is it called 2013 seadly wake .  it has nothing to do with the movie
-1	there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie .  one reason are some of the actors  ( like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh )  work ,  who tried to play at their usually good level of acting .  however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting .   the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg ,  which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so far .   everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be .  boring scenes ,  useless and boring dialogs ,  bad script work .  and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors .  it could have been an interesting story though ,  but they failed completely .
-1	malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different .  especially designed for people who like yellow filters on their movies .
-1	if mr cranky had rated this ,  i'd be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here .  but as he hasn't ,  i'll have to give it a go myself .   the only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that malcolm mcdowall's acting is excellent .  however not even he can save this film from disaster .  the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad '70's movies .  even worse ,  both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was .   it's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the proxate corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container/slave ship to nigeria .  this ship's computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via usb 12 or something .  the company should have been called the prostate corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name .   i honestly can't find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie .  i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - malcolm mcdowall in particular .  i won't hold this against him as he's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie .   so ,  unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you're male and you're doctor isn't doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you're really community minded ,  buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster .
-1	terrible use of scene cuts .  all continuity is lost ,  either by awful scripting or lethargic direction .  that villainous robot .  .  .  musta been a jazz dancer ?  also ,  one of the worst sound tracks i've ever heard  ( monologues usually drowned out by music .  )  and .  .  .  where'd they get their props ?  that ship looks like a milk carton .  .  .  i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13 !   i'd recommend any film student should watch this flick  ( 5 minutes at a time )  so as to learn how not to produce a film .  or .  .  .  was it the editors' fault ?   it's really too bad ,  because the scenario was actually a good concept .  .  .  just poorly executed all the way around .   ( sorry malcom .  you should have sent a  " stunt double "  .  you're too good an actor for such a stink-bomb .  )
-1	a terrible movie containing a bevy of d-list canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable .   this film is badly written ,  badly edited ,  and badly directed .  it is disjointed ,  incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way .  mcdowell does a great job with what he is given ,  but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with .  it's not even camp enough to be funny .   i have yet to see van pelleske act in a credible manner ,  and even the sub-characters like eisen  ( with his nasal ,  whiny voice )  confirm that we are on a lot in toronto rather than on a barge off africa .   didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit ?  the fight between the blue bolts of lightning and pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic'  (  !  ?  !  for lack of a better word )  ,  is obviously the result of bad actors ,  with no choreographer ,  overlaid with completely derivative special effects .  was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film  ( not the good kind )  ?    learn from the mistakes of others  .  .  .  don't even waste your time with this one ,  you'll regret it like i did .  i have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid .
-1	the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students .  .  .  to learn how not to make a film !   let's see .  .  .  what did the crew mess up in this flick ?  worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all-time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc .  let's face it ,  if this  " film "  had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white ,  and silent .  .  .  it still would have been awful .  all scenes are dark  ( lighting people call it  " black "  )  ,  often ,  the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs ,  which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect .  the  " evil "  robot was hilarious .  .  .  what was that ?  jazz dancing ?  oh .  .  .  i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something .  i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts .  .  .  of the poor editors .  and ,  how do you edit so much footage of garbage ?  not possible .  garbage is garbage ,  no matter how you splice it .  how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys ?  ?  ?   bottom line is- i couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments ,  it was so bad .  .  .  but i did see the whole thing  ( with lotsa breaks )  just to see if it had any good parts in it at all .  nope !  none !   a perfect example of how not to make a flick .  .  .  a must see for every serious film student !  !  !
-1	oh my .  how can they make movies of such beauty ,  but that are so terribly bad .  i mean ,  even uwe boll doesn't make crap like this .  there is not even a hint of a decent story ,  multi-layered characters ,  or attraction .  it's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a 'movie' .  i suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it ,  given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent ,  that anyone older would be annoyed by it .  but then again ,  it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age ,  that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all .   take my advice and stay far ,  far away from this movie .  your little daughter can make a better storyline ,  and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty ,  her tales are much more worth listening to .  and please ,  in the name of whoever you believe in ,  do not expose your children to this piece of **** .  i'll give it 2 out of 10 ,  and that's exclusively for the graphics ,  because the story and character development are so awful they'd deserve a negative rating .   and if you decide to watch it anyways .  .  .  remember that i warned you .
-1	this is one of those  " so bad it is good "  films that you always hear about but never see !  unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy  ( and i am not amused )  this one is 100% pure serious .   however with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining .   watcheable enough because of that .
-1	i find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom ,  american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this .  perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers ,  messiah of evil has potential ,  but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off .   the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back .  it doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror .   the surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon' ,  a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic  ( played by the great elisha cook jr .  in perhaps the best scene of the movie )  who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later ,  the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded ,  murderous ,  squirrel-eating albino .   part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way .  whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator ,  with messiah of evil the boundaries between the 'intentional' ,  the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - wrap scene' blur hopelessly .   take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled ,  feverish ,  stream-of-consciousness way ,  one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father ,  and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary .    while we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture ,  messiah of evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be .  the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse ,  bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'dark stranger' who came from the woods one day .  in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years  ( you can hear the mst3k line already :  'man is dead ,  only his capitalist food tins remain' )  and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater .   i generally think that the surreal works in careful ,  well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal ?  hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand .  when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her ,  you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience ,  amused and satisfied with his own hijinks .    the general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark ,  the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either .  add to that the choppy editing ,  average acting and hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and i'd file messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory ,  trashy or sleazy .
-1	i just watched this movie in high definition on television .  i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities .   at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating .  his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great .  and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things .  he was a great man .  but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching ,  that i found it insulting .   first of all ,  they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability .  sure they were competent actors ,  but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film .  further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches ,  appearing to have only one leg .  but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful .  what ?  they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film ?  for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee ?  at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am .   figure that out .
-1	i was so disappointed in this movie .  i don't know much about the true story ,  so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history .  with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination .  well ,  somewhere the screenplay failed them .  it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood ?  his love life ?  his own disability ?  his speaking ability ?  his passion for the disabled ?  i'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story ,  but this movie wasn't it .  i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities ,  but because of their personalities .  other small gripes :  1 .  the heavy-handed soundtrack .  it's the seventies - we get it already !  2 .  if he's such a phenomenal public speaker ,  why weren't we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages ?
-1	what about dahmer's childhood ? - the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body ?  what about  " infinity land "  ?  - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another ,  suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger .  what about the relationship between his parents ,  and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father ?  his feelings of neglect when his brother was born ?  what about his fascination with insects and animals ?  how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home ? what about focusing more on his cannibalism ?  and what about his parent's divorce ?  these are all things that should have been included in the film .  instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life ,  and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks ,  to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer .   why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people ?  he could have made this point many times ,  particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them  ( which actually took place in a health club ,  not a night club )  .  instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind .   whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes  ( or however long )  ,  but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet ?   ( known as rodney in this film )  .  my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character ,  to try and make us fear for or empathise with him ,  but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer ,  so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else ?  if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough ,  but it wasn't .  the scene in which he kills steven hicks ,  his first victim ,  is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing ,  and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life .  unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing ,  or that he didn't kill again for nine years .  we assume ,  because his hair style is different ,  and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback ,  but to when ?  and why ?    what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career ? -one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations .  .   some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal ,  but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth ,  it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed .  why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued ?   finally ,  a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate ,  not a 15 .  we needed to see his perversion in more depth ,  to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us .  that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance ,  but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed ,  and what his modus operandi was when actually killing .  anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people .  he actually killed seventeen men .   aside from the facts and lack of depth ,  the film isn't all bad .  there is some nice cinematography ,  and good performances from the two main characters .  i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge ,  more energy ,  and a better reason for making the film in the first place .
-1	disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer ,  who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates/serial killers .  released straight-to-video back in early 2003 ,   " dahmer "  is an overtly talky ,  boring ,  badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do !  what it does ,  however ,  attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely ,  nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold ,  calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was !  overall ,  2003's  " dahmer "  is one that true-crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial-killer biopics ever done !  it's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like  " gacy "  ,   " bundy "  ,   " ed gein "  and  " the night stalker "  !   ( turkey-zero stars )
-1	" dahmer "  is an interesting film although i wouldn't use  " horror "  or  " thriller "  do describe it .  it's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer .   jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer ,  who drugged ,  murdered and dismembered his male victims .  the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and  " rodney "  ,  well-played by artel kayàru .    rodney is almost the more interesting character :  enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack ,  he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack .   i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer's formative years ,  how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims .   the roles are well played but the story is thin .
-1	it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america's most notorious serial killers ,  but sadly it doesn't even come close .  terrible editing ,  direction ,  bad acting ,  you name it .  this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 .  the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father ,  but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker .  a 1 out of 10 .
-1	curiosity led me to this  " masterpiece "  .  unfortunately ,  i didn't rent it ,  i bought it !  the most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing .  for reasons known only to them ,  the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer .  are you kidding me ?  the man gave new meaning to the term  " finger lickin' good "  !  and with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards i had trouble following the story .  all in all jeremy renner's performance wasn't too bad .  you can catch him in  " s . w . a . t .  "  ,  in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop .  anyway ,  i would rate this as a 1/10 .  it only got a 1 because of renner's so-so performance .  there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer's crimes .  avoid this one .
-1	don't waste your time on this dreck .  as portrayed ,  the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture .   " gothic "  was entertainment at least ,  this is crap .  if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other ,  this may be right up your alley .  lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk ,  and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering .  mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever ,  but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect .  what a waste of time .  see gothic instead .  i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter ,  but didn't catch the title .  i was hoping this was it ,  but no such luck .  not recommended .
-1	way to go ace !  you just made a chilling ,  grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft ,  mellow ,  drama .  obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds :  horror ,  or documentary right ?  this was neither .  it wasn't close to any detailed facts ,   ( in fact it barely had any substance at all )  it wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing .  ( as if you would've had to try !  !  )  what the hell was this writer/director thinking ?  ?  here's one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot ,  poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent's house .  i think jacobson was actually trying to present  ( or invent )  'the soft side' of j . dahmer .
-1	i do have the `guts' to inform you to please stay away from `dahmer' ,  the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer .  `dahmer' strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject .  jeffrey dahmer ,  who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts ,  was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation .  however ,  the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm' project .  this is not an easy film to digest ,  even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas' appetizers or even some real-life `mr .  potato skins' .  * failure
-1	well ,  it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but i feel i must say something .  i wasn't exactly looking for 'a splatterfest' as someone puts it or even 'blood and guts/gore' .  i have some respect for the victims relatives although i really felt the filmaker didn't .  -they were nameless ,  faceless and meaningless .  just a vessel for dahmers sexual antics .   i watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'what makes a guy be a serial killer ? ' as well as wondering the specifics about the dahmer story ,  of which i know very little .  people here seem to think that the movie didn't have to cover the events of the dahmer story .  .  i . e .  his history ,  what happened when he got caught ,  the aftermath ,  etc but it is important !  you see ,  i assume if you are american you will know all of this .  we do not all live in america .  to tell this story about such a man as he obviously was ,  requires that at least some of the history and actual events are told/shown .  this doesn't mean blood and guts ,  there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore .  without even touching upon some of what he did  ( i found out more about him reading the user comments on this site !  )  ,  the movie felt like a void .  a moment in time with very little substance .  i would like to know if there is a film about the real dahmer because with its lack of direction ,  very slow pace that never changes ,  strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an ending ,  this movie is poor .  i would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it .  a definite 1 out of 10  ( for the acting !  )
-1	this movie had so much potential .  anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it's ridiculous .  too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption .  where was the character development ?  the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception .  where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals ?  instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer ,  but fail to address the major point in dahmer's development .  also ,  the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this ;  his cannibalism and his desire for flesh ,  etc .  i could go on ,  but to sum up ,  too many lagging points in the film ,  focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is  " dahmer .  "
-1	prior to watching  " dahmer ,  "  i thought no movie could be worse than  " freddy got fingered .  "  i was wrong .  to sum  " dahmer "  up ,  it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed .  there is no plot to be found ,  and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about  " dahmer .  "  all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men .  horrible acting ,  horrible directing ,  horrible writing ,  horrible everything .  .  .  if you have to choose between watching  " dahmer "  and projectile vomiting for three hours ,  go with the vomiting  .  .  .  .  it wll be less painful .  .  .  .  .
-1	i'm a big fan of the true crime genre ,  but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece .  it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica ,  down to the porn-flic soundtrack .  there was no look at what made dahmer tick ,  no exploration of who his victims were .  nothing but  " look at how creepy this guy is .  "  and i have to give the filmmakers this much -- their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen .
-1	dahmer ,  a young confused man .  dahmer ,  a confusing movie .  granted ,  i had a few beers while watching the movie ,  but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick .   its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying ,  and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end ,  the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie .  the inbetween stuff ,  which would be the movie ,  is just boring images and a waste of time .    we never see actual murders ,  everything is just a bunch of insinuations .  sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing ,  but you know he isn't ,  since it's  based on a true story and this actually happened ,  at least most of it .  but what happened ?  it's not easy to tell .   i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie .  i  didn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended .    */*****
-1	i really felt cheated after seeing this picture .  it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing .  i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this .  it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending .  it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel .  it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos .  it ends suddenly ,  and you know there's going to be another episode next week .  it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie .  there are many possibilities for what went wrong here ;  they got lazy ,  they ran out of money ,  they didn't know the rest of the story ,  they wanted to make a dahmer 2 .  after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate .  i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods .  all of a sudden i hear this music playing ,  then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 .  wow ,  he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail .  how about showing how he got there .  how about showing dahmer's trial .  how about showing some more detail .  i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place .  i actually found myself saying in disbelief ,   " that's it ,  that's the end ?  "  i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made .  to the filmmakers i'd like to say ,  if you're going to do it ,  do it right .
-1	this was a truly bad film .  the character  " cole "  played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped ,  the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil ,  it didn't .  after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance ,  this would have added some sincerity .   - 1 )  badly acted - 2 )  unsympathetic characters - 3 )  razor thin plot line  yuck !
-1	the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used .  if ms .  pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer .   otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies .  as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value ,  which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get .  perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to  " de-commercialize "  their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing .  .  .  .
-1	i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron .  i thought ,   " wonderful !  this will be great !  "  i was so wrong .  the story was all screwed up .  in fact i still don't get it .  it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink ,  smoke  ( opium ?  )  and have sex .  not that those aren't good movie qualities ,  but please !  where was the story ?  i made myself finish the movie ,  and yes ,  it did pick up towards the end ,  but by then the movie was almost over .  rent it if you really want to .  just don't trust the back of the box .
-1	saw in on tv late last night .  yeah ,  i can hear what y'all say about this one .  it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series .  in all fairness ,  the story line does have a fine twist to it ,  and you might nod saying ,   " well ,  that's not what i expected .  "  but ,  as a film ,  well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element .  casting ,  acting ,  camera work ,  cars ,  costume ,  setting ,  script ,  no ,  there's nothing to congratulate .  rated r ?  ?  oh ,  that scene .  did we need it ?  this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched .  and what was the title again ?
-1	this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian .  we grow good wine .  our writers and poets are among the world's best .  the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world .  but we make bloody awful movies !  this one isn't especially bad .  it's especially typical and typically bad ,  shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction ,  high school level acting and  " gee whiz .  .  . lets see what this button on the camera does ?  ?  "  photography .  if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation ,  couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation ?  and if the movie was shot in vancouver ,  truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building  ( part of the  " plot "  )  why in god's name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle ?  ?  ?  not only am i mad about this film ,  i'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed .  the australians turn out some splendid stuff .  we produce pretentious second rate piffle .  gawd !  !  !  !  !
-1	taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11 ,  watched it on fast forward .  i sugest you do the same .  i though it would be and action film ,  but went to a cort tv type movie .  in the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films .  glad i missed that era .  2/10
-1	once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h .  beam piper who wrote a classic book named  " little fuzzy "  which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet .  mr .  piper died in 1964 ,  but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold .  this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from .   skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of  " little fuzzy "  i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed ?   but don't take my word for it .  here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of  " little fuzzy "  for free :  http : //www . gutenberg . org/ebooks/18137
-1	skullduggery is a strange ,  strange film based on the novel  " ye shall know them "  by vercors .  to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind ,  since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity ,  and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance .  but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone ,  skullduggery simply isn't a very good film .  for me ,  the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message .  the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk ;  later it teeters into sci-fi fable ;  by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics .  the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great ,  too jarring ,  to overlook .  they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled ,  disorganised movie .   an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple  ( burt reynolds )  .  one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame  ( susan clark )  .  after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures .  these primitive ,  long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man .  there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the  " missing link "  in the evolution of apes into humans .  or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual ?  or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics ?  the archaeologists call the tribe  " the tropi "  and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery .  but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen  ( paul hubschmid )  declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers .  he questions whether the tropi are truly  " human "  and takes his argument to the courts ,  where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued .   this was a very early film in reynolds' career ,  and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously .  not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role ,  asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick .  his character and the film are not relevant to each other .  clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist ,  and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox ,  alexander knox and wilfrid hyde-white .  a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance .  rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids ,  the stuck-on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical .  and that's just not the right idea .  we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures ,  but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing .  skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant ,  philosophical and stimulating .  the honourable intentions are there for all to see ,  but the end result doesn't do them justice .  a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless .
-1	the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine .  all i can say is ,  it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film .  as far as i could tell ,  borgnine was the only actor in it .  the other performances were so uniformly terrible ,  i am amazed a studio would actually pay the  " performers "  to appear .  couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled ,  and you have a perfect cinematic disaster .  obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children ,  and to its credit ,  it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid-focused networks .  but honestly ,  that is not saying much .
-1	honestly ,  where can i begin !  this was a low budget ,  horribly acted film ,  it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was !  the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights ,  they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling !  !  me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day ,  so we decided to go to the store and look for one ,  and there it was the sawtooth island movie .  i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene .   oh and the plot of the film ,  the story board ,  the script ,  etc .  . was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it !  !  but if you happen to stumble upon this movie .  . do not get it !  !  !  !  !
-1	over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids ,  i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy ,  direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through  ( for anyone over the age of eight )  .  i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me  " what did she say that for ?  "  and  " why did he do that ?  "  and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes .  and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply  " bringing realism "  to a film ,  please run them through with a dull butter knife .   " prehysteria !  "  was head and shoulders above this .  arrgh .
-1	you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies .  this one comes complete with bad effects ,  props and bad acting  ( really bad )  .  plus ,  every time i see mercedes mcnab  ( the sister )  i keep thinking 'watch out !  she's a vamp !  " - for those that know buffy/angel .   a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick ,  the little that was spent of course .  i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money .   i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity ,  but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it .  .  .   umm .  .  . 1/10 because that's the lowest it will go .
-1	while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing ,  i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery .  perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age :  the movie was made ,  as it is now 2002 ,  an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings ,  and science fiction feats like star wars ,  as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey .   my beef ,  basically ,  is that i couldn't relate --i am just about the same age of the children  ( a young adult )  ,  and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available .  but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence .  i didn't find myself saying 'ack !  i would have done the same thing ! ' .  it did not open the doors to my imagination .  even without comparing it to high-budget films or other tv movies ,  standing alone ,  certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche :  the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking ,  seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run .  even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement :  a typical set of one or the other stereotypes .  there was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious ,  accompanied by mr .  perfect image of combining athletics ,  good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude ,  and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days .  while i know the personalities pushed the story along ,  i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable --and believable  ( as far as character ) -- movie .   i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me .  don't get me wrong :  all movies are worth seeing for yourself ,  and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many ,  but i think that with a little more depth to the script ,  and a little more  ( i cannot believe i am saying this )  realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical .
-1	a dreary and pointless bit of fluff  ( bloody fluff ,  but fluff )  .  badly scripted ,  with inane and wooden dialogue .  you do not care if the characters  ( indeed ,  even if the actors themselves )  live or die .  little grace or charm ,  little action ,  little point to the whole thing .  perhaps some of the set and setting will interest--those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived .  the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting ,  and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept .
-1	i know it's a power-rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ?  if they are going to write a plot with crayons ,  at least have the decency to make it silly .  it's kind of hilarious if you watch this .  we have a typical family filled with cliched characters  ( father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol )  ,  air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting ,  and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space .  funny stuff !   however ,  the real great moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight ,  but then they realize none of them know how to  ( probably because no room in budget for choreographers )  ,  so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in .  lol .   1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously .
-1	this film was on late at night when i saw it .  it was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole .  i am no tyson fan .  in fact i don't like boxing at all .  it's barbaric ,  obscene and double faced  ( by society )  that some get money for beating each other up .   nevertheless ,  i felt the start of the film was ok .  actors alright ,  especially george c .  scott  ( as cus d'amato )  .  i don't know how reliable the flick is .  i haven't read books and books about boxing or tyson .  i don't know anything about the man ,  but it was quite entertaining .   as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it's charm and i also lost interest .  i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough .
-1	a very ordinary made-for-tv product ,   " tyson "  attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect ,  fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing ,  and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting .  a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans .
-1	tyson   aspect ratio :  1 . 33 : 1  sound format :  stereo  reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson .  given his conviction on a rape charge ,  the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain ,  but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame ,  the pressures of success ,  and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad .  constrained by time limits ,  the script gallops through a succession of relevant details ,  alighting briefly on significant events ,  culminating with tyson's  ( temporary )  downfall in 1995 .  novices will be enlightened by the chronology ,  while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel's straight-arrow approach to the material .  he portrays tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success .  in fact ,  the script reserves most of its venom for tyson's ex-wife robin givens ,  characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety .  production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb :  michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character ;  george c .  scott plays tyson's mentor cus d'amato through acres of gritted teeth ;  and paul winfield was surely born to play don king !
-1	as far as spaghetti westerns go ,  i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre .  it's not that the movie is particularly bad ,  but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen .  guy madison does his best in the lead role ,  but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off .  with one notable exception ,  the rest of the cast isn't particularly good .  the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before .  there's just not much to get very excited about .   the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri .  she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film .  unfortunately ,  her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes .   ( note :  the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong .  rosalba neri does not play jenny benson .  instead ,  she is the character melin .  i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie .  )
-1	second-tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western  which ,  having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine  ( though featuring a nice enough score )  .  the plot offers some mild interest :  the title ,  incidentally ,  refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun-runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer ,  cavalry agent madison .  the latter's younger siblings are determined that the injured party ,  now in their charge ,  lead them to the gang boss responsible ;  ultimately ,  the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both ,  ironically ,  become involved with one of madison's sisters  ( another is raped during the raid )  .  euro-cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess ,  and madison's ex-flame .
-1	this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling .   the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none ,  also no real suspense .   washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it ,  there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast .   the story simply falls a little flat ,  even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact ,  you don't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare .   there is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships carter but this seems forced .   it's an ok film but instantly forgettable .
-1	fairly good movie ,  but not a true story .   rubin  " hurricane "  carter was a notorius liar ,  a murder and was never found not guilty .  new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone .  carter got an offer in 1976 :   " pass a lie test and go free "  .  he didn't take it .  this film should never have been made ,  but money talks .  a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white .  why choose a fake story ?   jens
-1	this movie looks like it was made for tv  .  for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter ,  because i loved to see him box at the old msg ,  and to see this movie was very disappointing . i have alot of respect for mr washington ,  but he was awful and boring . there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song .
-1	denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie .   maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie .  someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie ,  giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes .  that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before .   so first it confuses you and then it puts you off .  the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve .   of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers .  granted ,  it does that so if you are looking for that  .  .  .  knock yourself out .
-1	this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen .  the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered ,  so hero sets out to exact revenge ,  foils the ineffective lawman ,  rescues the kidnapped loving damsel ,  and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel .  this formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see .  the scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting ;  it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth ,  maturity ,  and realism .  the sound is bad ;  it sometimes looks dubbed .  the cinematography is lame ,  and the sets are sometimes just facades .  the acting is pitiful ;  sure ,  some of the performers could blame the script ,  but others cannot use that excuse .  i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again ;  every time he says a line that should be angry or mean ,  he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho .  and speaking of chris lybbert ,  who plays hopalong ,  check out his duds  ( if you dare to watch this film )  :  he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard-working ,  down-and-dirty cowboy .  if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy ,  then get this ,  but if you have more than two neurons ,  watch something else .
-1	when i saw this movie i heard all the hype ,  and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent .  i was wrong .  i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community  ( if they are not african americans themselves )  .  i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won .  sometimes this is true  ( not as much nowadays )  because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture .  the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was ,  is because people see a movie about the  ( *semi-spoiler* )  hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece .   denzel washington is an outstanding actor ,  but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever .  i was bored with him in the movie ,  and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good .  the audience is supposed to leave believing this man ,  rubin carter ,  is a saint .  people left the movies worshipping this man ,  this hero ,  and they went out and bought his book ,  making this hero of a man rich .   *spoilers* this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit .  of course the crimes he did commit  ( stealing mostly )  was only to survive ,  nothing more .  people felt sorry for him ,  even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society .  everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint  ( except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife )  but why wouldn't it-after all ,  it is his point of view .  i do not like movies  ( especially hollywood interpretations )  that are based on  " true "  stories because they usually distort the  " true "  parts into something else ,  something not so true .  this was his point of view and a hollywood construction ,  yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably .  well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions ,  and he was a very violent man .  not only that ,  there is still a possibility that he did murder those people .  if you do not believe me ,  search for him on the internet ,  and read the articles some people have of him .  the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily ,  was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it .  besides that ,  there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie .  the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their  " nice and perfect "  persona looked difficult to keep up .   this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully .  denzel's acting is stale ,  and the supporting cast's mickey mouse attitudes are annoying .  the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring .
-1	if this movie was about a fictional character ,  the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively .  unfortunately for the viewer ,  the movie is based on  " facts "  that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter .  many of the smaller facts were disregarded  ( carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders ,  there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth )  ,  but some of the larger facts ,  like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of  " racist "  judges ,  is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape ,  and completely disrespectful to giardello .  why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who ,  at best ,  was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be  ( was arrested multiple times for beating women )  is strange to me .  ruben carter was never ,  by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now ,  when he refuses to speak to his son ,  a person that people can look up to .  everyone knows that jewison can direct ,  and washington can act ,  but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me .  is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable ?   ( heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself ?  now thats inspirational )  based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie ,  i would suggest passing on this one .
-1	this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with .  saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent ,  stayed up late to do so ,  was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance , 4% everything else ,  1% history if that .  it's what i call a bait and switch movie ,  one with an interesting title ,  the actual movie is a scam .  this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment ,  this movie is almost an insult to those who served .  the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes ,  they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france .  and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter's character .  flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls ,  an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days ,  it would have either been the stockade or the infantry .  discipline in the french army was often rather fierce .  in short ,  another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment .
-1	probably the worst film i've ever seen ,  the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep .  the only good actor was colm meaney .  i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end ,  no emotion ,  no charisma .  .  . nothing  !
-1	i had high hopes for this film ,  because i thought clean ,  shaven  ( kerrigan's first feature )  was absolutely terrific ,  the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen .   but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat .  scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix ,  without much thought for narrative or character .   is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not ?  hard to tell .  why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life ?  why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle ?  why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color ?  why does claire accept some johns and not others ?  the filmmaker doesn't seem to know .   it feels as if everything is improvised  ( though i understand this wasn't the case )  and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary .   after the screening i saw ,  kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative .  it sounded like learned rhetoric .  i think it was a cop-out .   i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean ,  shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old  " political "  cliches .
-1	this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii .  i was under ten years of age .  and that's the audience this serial is designed for .  looking at it now ,  one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity .  the budget must have been next to nothing ,  given the shortcuts and repeats .  the acting ?  well ,  this is republic pictures ,  1944 .  they read the lines .  .  .  . and no doubt had one take to make them convincing .   one and half stars .
-1	like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film ,  especially the  " film makers were then attacked "  aspect that the case seems to emphasize ,  what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob .   then ,  to watch the film and discover ,  oh ,  what they mean by  " the film makers were attacked "  was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said  " someone should beat those two kids up .  "  the picture on the cover ,   " the chase "  as it were ?  total fabrication .  which i guess ties in with the theme of the film ,  lying and manipulation to satisfy vain ,  stupid children with more money and time then sense .   i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film .  it's like michael moore's  " roger & me "  ,  but if  " roger & me "  was moore mocking the people of flint .  it's completely misdirected and totally inane .  wow !  can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food ?  what jerks !  and it's not so much ,   " look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah "  ,  since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors ,  it was that ,  as many people in the film say ,  the prices were absurdly low ,  someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck .  that's not proving anything except that people who are poor ,  will go to a store that has low prices ,  bravo fellas ,  way to stick it to the people on the bottom .   way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people .  you should be very proud .  how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then ,  say ,   " haha !  no such house exists !  your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media !  "  .   morgan  " please like me "  spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him .   avoid like the plague .
-1	the main problem with the documentary  " czech dream "  is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying .   in an audacious - i hesitate to use the word  " inspired "  - act of street theater ,  vit klusak and filip remunda ,  two student filmmakers from the czech republic ,  pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie :  they deliberately fabricated a phony  " hypermarket "   ( the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store )  ,  built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards ,  radio and tv spots ,  an official logo ,  a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many  " dopes "  would show up to their creation on opening day .  they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed .   one might well ask ,   " why do such a thing ?  "  well ,  that's a very good question ,  but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one .  essentially ,  we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that's not true - simply through the power of advertising .  and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the  " real "   ( i . e .  higher )  purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union .  fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers ,  all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of  " research "  into what does and does not work in advertising .  in a way ,  by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments ,  these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse .   but ,  in many ways ,  the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target ,  it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it .  for it is they themselves and not the good-hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here ,  as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people ,  some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot .  and what is all this supposed to prove anyway ?  that people are  " greedy "  because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains ?  or that they're stupid and gullible because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised ?  such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world .   no ,  i'm afraid this smart-alecky ,  nasty little  " stunt "  only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots .  and ,  indeed many of them ,  when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them ,  react with a graciousness and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position .   i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but ,  when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes ,  we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed .
-1	loved the original story ,  had very high expectations for the film  ( especially since barker was raving about it in interviews )  ,  finally saw it and what can i say ?  it was a total mess !  the directing is all over the place ,  the acting was atrocious ,  the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat ,  empty and completely unnecessary  ( whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense ?  it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson/smashing pumpkins/placebo music video )  .  whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal ,  some are just ridiculously laughable  ( the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi's death was just stupidly funny )  .  it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense ,  totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more .  no explanations were given whatsoever ,  i mean i knew what was happening only as i'd read the story but for people who hadn't it's even more confusing as at times even i didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time .   god ,  i really wanted to like this film as i'm a huge fan of barker's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie ,  hell i even enjoyed some of kitamura's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- i didn't care about anyone or anything ,  the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source ,  turning it into something else entirely .  granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass ,  but everything else was all over the place ,  more than disappointing .  gutted
-1	i heard and read many praising things about  " midnight meat train "  ,  which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original  " hellraiser "  that he directed himself ,  but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience .  the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is :  nauseating !  the violence is sadistic and extreme ,  which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts ,  but it's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative .  normally speaking ,  i'm very pro-violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose .  the butchering  literally  depicted in  " midnight meat train "  is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs ,  and even that isn't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects .  there are more shortcomings ,  some even bigger than the pointless gore ,  but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first .  the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences  ( like the chase in the freezer room ,  for example )  are literally oozing with nail-biting suspense and macabre atmosphere .  unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted .  presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities ,  but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones .  the plot introduces leon ,  an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures .  leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train .  leon's right ,  as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer ,  but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the rails at night .   " midnight meat train "  takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs ,  plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images  ( like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood )  ,  but director ryûhei kitamura  (  " versus "  ,   " godzilla final wars "  )  doesn't take full advantage of it all .  the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and ,  even if clive barker meant to have like this ,  i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale .   " midnight meat train "  is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film ,  but not without defaults .  it's not intended for easily offended viewers ,  but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .
-1	i don't know why ,  but i thought i've seen this movie before .  maybe it was the name ,  maybe it was the way poster looked ,  i don't know .  anyway ,  it was quite promising in the beginning .  and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments .  maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors ,  and i don't watch them a lot ,  but this one actually looked fresh sometimes .  but the rest of it is not so good .  laughable at times .  the movie is slow paced ,  sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about .  characters are not great either .  all of them .  the butcher is ok ,  seems creepy and crazy enough .  although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest  ( that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue )  ,  and why he was collecting those in jars at home ?  the main lead is plain .  his character is really hard to believe in ,  and very undeveloped .  but i guess thats scenarists fault .  like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend ?  side cast is bad too .  but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl .  my god ,  when will women in horror movies have any brains ?  its ridiculous .  the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera ,  tries going to police ,  that fails ,  and then she thinks of the best idea ever .  why don't we just go and take it !  i know where the maniac lives !  yup !  thats swell !  and then look for the camera in the bathroom !  why not ?  and then walk in the room ,  see a bag that was not there before ,  and just have a look inside .  maybe camera is there ?  not there .  but loads of interesting stuff .  shiny .  mmmm .  to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain .  then of course the never ending  " falling while running away "  trick ,  that really made it look bad .  then ,  to put the final nail into the character ,  in the end of the movie ,  she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up ,  screams  " noooo "  like she just ripped her gucci bag ,  and walks further into the wagon .  .  .  jeez .  come on .  no one else thinks its just ,  well ,  stupid ?  just awful .  if her character wasn't so bad ,  maybe the movie would get another star or two from me .  and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer  ( that dude in the train who the conductor killed )  ,  butcher vests that can protect from bullets ,  weird and cheap looking monsters in the end  ( i didn't read clive barkers novel ,  so i have no idea where those monsters came from )  ,  the fact that no one cared that hundreds  ( judging on the skeletons in the dungeon )  disappeared in the city ,  and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out  ( he barely noticed it i guess )  .  oh ,  and the predictable ending .  damn ,  i knew the ending half way in ,  its just disappointing .  the only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers ,  is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months .  visual style is nice ,  some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal .   ( although blood didn't look real at all )  i guess some people will enjoy it ,  some ,  like me ,  will watch it if there is nothing else to watch ,  some will absolutely hate it .
-1	ok ,  so i just saw the movie ,  although it appeared last year .  .  .  i thought that it was generally a decent movie ,  except for the storyline ,  which was stupid and horrible .  .  .  first of all ,  we never get to know anything about the creatures ,  why they appeared ,  wtf are they doing in our world ,  and really ,  have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space ?  secondly ,  the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created .  .  .  really ,  how large could the underground for a sub station could have been ?  there were only so many of those creatures ,  so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain ,  they could have just planted some tactical bombs ,  or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job .  i know it sounds funny and it is ,  but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary .  .  .  thirdly ,  leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones ,  who was way taller and bigger in stature .  then again ,  when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp ,  watching all the abominations .  i mean ok ,  the conductor had creepy help ( lol )  ,  but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way .  .  .  i mean he risks his life first ,  then does nothing exactly when he should have .  he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward .  .  .  this might be the case ,  but not after showing so much braveness earlier on .  .  .  then ,  the cop thing .  .  .  come on !  this was a city having a subway ,  i bet there must have been other cops except that lady ,  other police stations , this was really kind of silly .  .  .  all in all ,  great acting by vinnie jones ,  interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all .  .  .  by the way ,  what did the signs on the chest mean ?  vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest .  .  .
-1	i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made .  if you doubt me ,  please look at my other reviews .  however ,  for the first time ever ,  i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over .   i love bad movies .  to me ,  ed wood is a genius ,  i thought bloody murder ,  jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good .  however ,  there is not a single good thing i can say about this film .   the plot is basically non existent .  if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it ,  they can discern for themselves what the plot might be ,  but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie .   the special effects are bad .   the acting is bad .   the two leads are attractive ,  but that's all there is .   i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone ,  but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo . com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it .  i will tell you anything .   i love bad movies ,  and i love horror and i love new inventive movies .  i even love horror porn stuff like hostel  ( which some reviewers claimed this was like ,  but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 )  .  but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made .   and before you disregard this review ,  this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead ,  but actually bought a copy of it .
-1	one hour ,  eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame .  that was right after hopalong  ( chris lybbert )  drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse .  i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all .  obviously ,  the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here ,  even with more than one listed .   if you make it to the end of the film ,  you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did .  what exactly was the hook with the gloves ?  what's up with the rodeo scenario ?  who was the stranger supposed to represent ?  why did they make this film ?    i could probably go on but my energy's been drained .  look ,  there's already a western called  " the gunfighter "  from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character .  watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad .  that one i can recommend .
-1	it was no sense and it was so awful .  .  .  i think hollywood have a lot of film like that .  .  .  you don't have do watch it .  people cutter or eater what should i say .  .  .  it made me sick !  oh my god !  film is about people that we don't know but feed themselves with humans !  they have teeths bla bla bla .  .  .  isn't that familiar ?  i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie .  the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful .  and i should say that bradley cooper was totally awesome .  .  .  he's so talented .  .  .  actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes .  .  .  let me explain it .  did you ever eat tongue ?  but in the film one person did it !  it was really awful .  .  .  anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes .  .  .
-1	i have heard a lot about this film ,  with people writing me telling me i should see it ,  as i am a fan of extremely bloody ,  gory movies .  i got my hands on it almost right away ,  but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now .  i would have been better off not remembering i even had it .   this movie was atrocious .  the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was .  i know it was a story by clive barker and all ,  and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be ,  as i was ,  completely clueless and utterly disappointed .   the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing ,  the story interesting .  the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention .  i thought the blood looked a bit bad ,  but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on .  i was wrong .    the blood and effects are so horrible ,  it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that ,  for instance ,  someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer .  wtf ?  cgi blood  ( did they even use any  " real "  blood at all ?  my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film !  )  ,  unbelievable acts of dismemberment  ( eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head ;  arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies ?  !  )  ,  too-dark scenes  ( every scene is either an odd yellow color ,  or in hidden in shadows )  .  .  . it just gets worse and worse .  i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake .  there's just too much .  add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end .  .  . no thank you !  it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok ,  with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer .  maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant ?  plausible ,  doable .  .  . and a lot better i think than the  " real "  story .  that could have and should have worked .  instead it became a  " creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you ,  and unless you read the book ,  well .  .  . you just won't ever understand it "  fiasco .  tragic ,  what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential .  if you like mindless fake blood and gore ,  you'll love this .  but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it .  stay away- far ,  far away .
-1	this was a terrible film .  there was no story line whatsoever .  to top it all off ,  when they couldn't explain the blood and gore  ( the only good part )   .  .  .  they threw in a few aliens !  i hate when directors  ( or whatever )  run out of ideas and then blame the aliens !  watch this film if you like .  but don't say i didn't warn you .  two things :  how could vinny say  " welcome "  when he didn't have a tongue ?  its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role .  second thing that bugged me ,  why were we shown vinny jones' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid ,  then these have no further role .  why not ?  i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever .  in short .  bad story .  i wouldn't waste my time - wish i'd have watched mirrors instead .
-1	where to start .  the film started out pretty well ,  but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock .  the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in .  it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by .   the actors gave an average performance in this movie however ,  i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film .   as the film dragged on ,  and take my word for it ,  it dragged on ,  it just got more and more far fetched .   *** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** just when i thought the film could not get any worse ,  towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up ,  just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all .  it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end .  the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was .  once the lead role disposes of vinny jones ,  he becomes the new killer .   in closing ,  this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made .  i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie !  !
-1	i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this !  i haven't seen such a bad movie for years . omg this was a really bad movie .  splatter ,  is not enough to describe the unnecessary  ( nearly funny )  blood scenes )  .  if you didn't like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween  ( 2007 )   .  . well this is 10 time worse .  the story remind me rl stine goosebumps .  !   i can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible . cliché all the time .   ( why i must write 10lines ?  i never understood this .  )   ==here comes spoilers==  the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro .  we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice .  actually those people are just missing .  and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery  ( well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy )  and as usual no one believes him !  what a surprise !  in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher !
-1	i would just like it to be known ,  that i do not often rate movies below a 5 .  i was originally very excited to see this movie .  its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie .  so ,  the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand ,  i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film .   the storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway .  there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people .  where are they going ?  what's happening to them ?  one day ,  the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken ,  and becomes obsessed with the butcher ,  following him around ,  yada yada .  the film had a way of sucking you in ,  even though the plot was highly predictable .   " oh no ,  it's dark ,  look out behind you "  i say ,  quite bored with the cheap thrills .   the plot ,  even though predictable ,  was intriguing .  .  . that is ,  until the end .   " this was good until the end .  .  .  .  then it just got silly "  ,  says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards .  and i fully agree .  and here come the spoilers .  .  .   see ,  i was hoping it was some mad killer ,  some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism .  no .  it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries .  woo .  how original .  how unrealistic .  how dull .   3/10 .  come on lionsgate .  you've had amazing films ,  but this one sunk .
-1	do not bother to waste your money on this movie .  do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you .  if you must see a movie this weekend ,  go see batman again .   the script was horrible .  perfectly written from the random horror movie format .  given :  a place in confined spaces ,  a madman with various weapons ,  a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together ,  and an innocent and overly curious ,  yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend .  mix together ,  add much poorly executed gore ,  and what the hell ,  let's put some freaks in there for a little  " spin "  to the plot .   the acting was horrible ,  and the characters unbelievable - borat was more believable than this .   ***spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch ?  ?  ?  i'm in the army .  we need that kind of stuff for ourselves .   1 out of 10 ,  and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can .
-1	wow ,  how bad can it get .  this was seriously bad .  not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable cgi - but in acting ,  atmosphere and direction .   the story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke .  within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones ,  he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend .  um .  .  .  are all new york photographers this childish ,  suggestible and weak ?  his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable ,  and totally absurd twist his character takes .   the gory moments were clearly just a weak ,  low-self-esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon - all cgi ,  blood yet no real emotion whatsoever .  these parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - wacky camera angles etc .   overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea .  what could have had atmosphere  ( until the stupid monsters at the end )  is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self-conscious directing .  this film wasn't made for and audience - it was made for a cv - a deeply selfish motive .
-1	the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie .  unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie .  i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted ,  but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western .  i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along ,  or just a spoof .  the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic .  not realistic at all .  a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic ,  but the shooting scenes were a joke .  a previous commentator thought this movie was great ,  and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush .  this was not a democratic or republican western .  it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially .  i wonder if it made any money .  at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students .  if that was the case ,  then it was a great movie .
-1	i often feel like scrooge ,  slamming movies that others are raving about - or ,  i write the review to balance unwarranted raves .  i found this movie almost unwatchable ,  and ,  unusual for me ,  was fast-forwarding not only through dull ,  clichéd dialog but even dull ,  clichéd musical numbers .  whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical ,  lots of fantasy ,  some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development .  individually ,  june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people ,  but can't carry a movie as a team .  neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal .  they're both bland .  i like billy gray ,  but his character is pretty one-note .  the best part of the film ,  to me ,  are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body .
-1	i was never so bored in my life .  hours of pretentious ,  self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems .  it's like watching lizards molt .  even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy .  if you have insomnia ,  rent this .
-1	one previous reviewer called this film  " pure visual joy "  i am wondering if s/he saw the same film that i did .   " high art "  had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since  " seven "  .  one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the cliché of going to a b&b for their first time .  of course ,  before they do that ,  one has to watch opium-den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit .  not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types ,  the girlfriend/boyfriend at start ,  who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so .  the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now .  what did she do ,  retire at age twenty ?
-1	this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling .  so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer .  this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope .  the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds ,  someone is snorting heroin .  if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin ,  then this would be a pretty good movie .  every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere ,  someone inhaled the white powder .  it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie .  it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer .  the lesbian stuff didn't bother me .  i was looking for a movie about art .  i found a movie about drug use .
-1	spooks is enjoyable trash ,  featuring some well directed sequences ,  ridiculous plots and dialogue ,  and some third rate acting .   many have described this is a uk version of  " 24 "  ,  and one can see the similarities .    the american version shares the weak silly plots ,  but the execution is so much slicker ,  sexier and i suspect ,  expensive .   some people describe weak comedy as  " gentle comedy "  .    this is gentle spy story hour ,  the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre .   give me smiley any day .
-1	this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it ,  the fast-moving story ,  an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths ,  etc .  funny thing is ,  you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but  " white "  as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police .    nonetheless ,  woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players ,  is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes .   snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines ,  providing much of the humor .  the bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters .  that includes woody's girlfriend ,  played by rosie perez .  there are no really clean ,  nice people in this movie .  for that reason ,  i can't honestly recommend the film ,  at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
-1	woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court .  okay ,  that sounds all right there .  it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story .  but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film .  this movie became redundant ,  retarded ,  and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by .  woody harrelson played one of my favorite t . v .  characters ,  woody from cheers ,  and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie .  but after seeing his  "  acting performance  "  i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend .  his acting was as dull and poor as the movie .  another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez .  i have liked movies with perez before ,  but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines  (  do the right thing  )  .  but now in white men can't jump she was made a central character with many lines ,  thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice .  so after seeing this film  (  term used loosely  )  and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i'm a white man and i'm getting ready to jump  .   .   .  off a twenty story apartment building .
-1	you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of  " jeopardy !  "  .   the saddest thing about white men can't jump is that it had tremendous potential .  for several years ,  i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film ;  racial tensions were high ,  and basketball meant everything to everyone .  a film about the members of this  " basketball culture "  could have been very interesting ,  but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can't job left something to be desired .   the movie's sequence of events is cyclical .  first ,  billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball .  he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend ;  and the process is repeated .  most stories build up to a climax of some kind ,  but the  " climax "  i saw was just another sequence in this repetition  ( this case being  " billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball "  )  .   in order for a plot to develop ,  some dilemma must be resolved ;  and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well .  apparently the writers of white men can't jump forgot this rule ,  as the plot can be summarized as  " billy needs to pay the bills .  "  i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies ,  but -- i'm sorry -- this was just plain awful .  i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment .   despite all this ,  white men can't jump is a successful film .  apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them .  others ,  i'm sure ,  were lured by the big names playing the leading roles .  this leaves me to wonder ,  if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors ,  and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse ,  would anyone have bothered watching this movie ?  i really don't think so .   i'll give this movie two stars out of ten ;  the extra star is for the  " jeopardy !  "  scene ,  which kept me awake for a few minutes .  thanks ,  trebek .
-1	i really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star .  .  .  how can you like such a retarded film ,  where all the animal abuse scenes are real ?  i don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments .  .  .  jesus .  .  .  what kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason ,  or just for money ?  i tell you ,  that director is either mentally retarded ,  or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone .  or both .  he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive .   it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock ,  especially to sensitive persons and children :  a real frog is skinned alive ,  fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water ,  a dog is beaten ,  birds are thrown into the water .  .  .   this movie is more than awful ;  it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made ,  along with another one ,  called ''cannibal holocaust'' or something like that .  i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster .  no one should waste their time watching it ,  especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there ,  in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged .   fortunately ,  only a few people liked this - which is natural ,  since it's the worst film ever - ,  so it wasn't successful .  i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised ,  and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films .  i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give !  there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others .   this ,  however ,  is probably my only ''negative'' review .  i usually don't comment on a movie if i dislike it ,  but this time i just couldn't shut up .  i had to speak the truth ,  because animal abuse must stop !
-1	i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit .  the script and dialogue is laughable .  the acting was awful ,  where did they get them from ?  music was ok i have to say .  luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of .   i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger  ( martin sheen )  started to tell his story .  i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league .  but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter .  i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better ,  never did .
-1	i'll say this much--this director is all about raw images .  .  . things most of us are not ready to confront head-on .  images of sex ,  suicide ,  murder ,  and people  " relieving themselves "  are constantly bombarding the viewer ,  which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release .  although i don't think that i could ever see this movie again ,  i will say that the director does have a good eye .  there were some really nice shots and  " picture moments "  in the film  ( the fans ,  the wire fish in their hair )  ,  but the story left me needing more  ( strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves  " what the heck did we just see ?  "  )  .   note :  if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily .  .  . don't see this film .
-1	is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant ,  life-spanning testimonial of  " spring ,  summer ,  fall ,  winter and spring "  ?  the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite ,  nearly silent ,  heartbreaking longing of  " 3 iron "  ?  the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of  " the coast guard "  and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all  ( characters and viewers alike )  to experience redemption in  " samaritan girl "  ?  i just cannot seem to find him in this film .   oh ,  sure ,  kim's nature motif is still present .  the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters .  yes ,  it's kim ki duk ,  all right .  kim even describes the film as  " beautiful "  in an interview included in the dvd's special features .  but i'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation .   what is beautiful about angry ,  potty-mouthed prostitutes ,  lustful ,  violent and potty-mouthed fishermen ,  a covetous mute merchant ,  explicit animal torture ,  sequences of self-mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality ?  these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film .  if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater ,  this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material .  it has been favorably compared to  " audition "  by japanese director takashi miike  ( much to kim's satisfaction )  ,  but aside from some astonishingly good performances ,  especially given what they had to work with ,  by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk ,  i find little reason to recommend this film .  i have not seen  " audition ,  "  but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of  " the isle .  "  its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic .  its sex is not pornographic ,  but passionless and masochistic .  characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot .  its point is either non-existent or ,  i will admit ,  lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand .   the only beauty is in the cinematography ,  which is classic kim :  fog-shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake ,  mountainous terrain dominating the background ,  and an imaginative and playful use of color .  at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room .  some touches ,  like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes ,  are intriguing .  but as a film ,  this effort is downright confusing and ,  in the end ,  offensive to the senses ,  not necessarily to sensibilities .  one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film-making in the trash heap of his past ,  for we know he is capable of so much more .
-1	i generally don't give worry much about violence in films ,  or a vast amount of philosophy ,  symbolism or psychology .  all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us .  there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature ,  a good setting of characters ,  a good direction .  this film could be voted for as a good film .  however ,  it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting .   first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film .  not movie violence ,  i am talking about real violence .  this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two ;  the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women .  not that we all don't have some real twists with women .  ( respectively men )  .  but the conclusion of the film ruins it all .    *spoiler* our  " heroine "  finally dies ,   ( by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me ,  now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch ) and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon ,  nature growing over her ,  in particular her sex .  .  of course it is the director who  " kills "  the women heroine .  women have to die ,  especially if men are attracted by their sexuality .  that seems to be the final conclusion . **end spoiler*  well ,  well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself .  but to use big pictures ,  artsy directions cruelty to living creatures ,  just to say men can be frightened of women ,  and men are cruel to women .  thats just not enough .  i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the  " philosophical ,  eastern and artistic "  and whatever approach .  but to me this film is just totally marred .
-1	hey look ,  deal with it ,  there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this .  although i think this story is weak ,  my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story ,  which i have mentioned ,  blows .   this was made in the mid-80's and is horrible in the music/score department .  it's funny to see oprah as a latter-day crack-whore type .   the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator .  pure classic cinema .  first off ,  i don't care how drunk you are ,  you will react to 1200f degree flame  ( no matter how bad your acting )  .  but they really milked that scene .  .  . it was comical .  i'll tell you what though ,  i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death ;  she annoys me .
-1	of all the movies i've seen ,  this one rates almost at the bottom  ( haunted mansion ,  nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom .  )  it is hasty ,  the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted .  of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door .  the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous ,  and illogical .  oprah gives a palatable appearance as  " bigger's "  mom ,  but is not nearly at her potential .  other famous performers also seem to be at their worst .  the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur .  in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted .  one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk .  now the family he's working for are not against blacks ,  but he thinks they are .  so when he comes home he puts her to bed ,  but she begins caterwauling .  the blind mother  ( yes )  hears this ,  so bigger tries to silence her ,  but instead smothers her .  now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace .  so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace  ( the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes .  he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom .  if your desperate for a bad movie ,  this one could do the job ,  but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40's and 50's or see a good drama ,  there are a lot better options .  avoid this .
-1	i'm not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie ,  but it obviously had nothing to do with richard wright's novel ,  which the movie is based on .   we read the novel this past summer for ap english 12 ,  and just watched the film .  during periodic note-taking and checking of the clock ,  i contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning .  of course ,  the sky was completely clear ,  and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie .  .  .  and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it .   wright's novel discussed very real themes ,  of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it .  silver's movie turned a murderer into a victim ,  which is not what wright wanted  ( see :   " how bigger was born "  454 )  .   i'm going to make this short and sweet :  if you want to leave your consciousness ,  in raphael lambert's words ,  unsullied ,  skip the movie and read the book .  the 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material .    .  .  .   :  : sigh :  :  now i have to write the essay .
-1	as good an advert for republicanism as you're ever likely to see ,  " mayerling " is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century austria . set during one of europe's seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the emperor franz joseph  ( mr james mason )  , his rebellious son , the crown prince rudolf  ( mr omar sharif ) the empress ( miss ava gardner )  and various mistresses , secret policemen , spies , extravagantly-uniformed popinjays , gypsies , dancers , wives ,  soldiers , swans , horses and the bizarre inbred web of european royalty at the time of franz joseph's austro-hungarian empire .  filmed in what the old movie posters used to call  " a riot of color "  it resembles nothing more than an expensively-dressed but intellectually-challenged production of  " the student prince "   . mr james mason , wearing a very natty little white number , utilises his all-purpose mittel-european accent whenever he remembers . i am a great admirer of his and i sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing .  mr omar sharif , who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful , gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the crown prince . he is utterly unconvincing as a man who -in the movie at least-cut a swathe through the distaff side of the austrian aristocracy . with his well-buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms . as a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk , leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes . unhappily married , he falls in love with a commoner .  " forbidden love "  is one of the movie's come-ons . as she is played by the most uncommon miss catherine deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there . miss deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it , particularly in the sequence set at the ballet .  now i love ballet as much as the next man , but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time , a more cynical critic might consider it to be  " padding "  .  rudolf's mother , the empress is played by miss ava gardner . she gives the part some good old american oooomph , making her a bit like  " auntie mame "  , but it's done with undeniable style . rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother - i'll put it no more strongly than that .  the only performance worth watching is that of mr james robertson justice as sir lancelot spratt - sorry , edward , prince of wales . he is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it's a joy to behold . i waited vainly for him to ask rudolf the immortal question  " what's the bleeding time ?  "  .  i am not qualified to dispute  " mayerling "  's historical accuracy , but , in my opinion , everything else about it is risible .  it is a ruritanian opera buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling .
-1	watch the 1936 version .  as personally annoying i find charles boyer's voice ,  he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan ,  depressed rudolf--i mean omar sharif tries but ,  no--too cute and vibrant .  catherine denueve  ( sp )  besides being too old looks nothing like marie--nothing !  she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion .   the only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief  ( and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance )  as historically ,  empress elisabeth wasn't involved that much in rudolf's life .
-1	despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky ,  or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s ,  i really had no opinion of the man ,  save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist ,  although i could not elucidate any of his theories ,  and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings .  so ,  stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky :  rebel without a pause ,  in a used video store ,  a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11 ,  i decided to get it ,  just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person ,  pro or con ,  spoke of him .  while glad i got the film ,  my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was ,  so what's all the fuss about ?   for a man with so many degrees ,  lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive' ,  by the new york times ,  according to the dvd's case ,  there sure was not a lot there ,  intellectually speaking .  i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate ,  and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f .  buckley could do to him .  granted ,  the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere ,  and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say ,  rather than being on linguistics ,  so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly .  but ,  again ,  if he is a linguist ,  and tops in his field ,  why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ?  .  even worse are his acolytes ,  who seem to further insulate the man from reality ,  by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins .  what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film ,  this much i knew :  he was generally considered a has been ,  and pretty much irrelevant intellectually ,  since the fall of the soviet empire .  the film is so poorly structured ,  and without a narrative thread ,  that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble .  his wife ,  carol ,  as example ,  apparently gave one interview ,  which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film .  she seems a nice enough woman ,  but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life .  the lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the chomskys ,  for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then .   not surprisingly ,  this sort of film gives almost no biographical background .  it's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears .  chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one .  stylistically ,  there are no camera movements ,  no interesting edits ,  nor any signature touches ,  and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky ,  videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that ,  and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial ,  that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him .  this is really poor film-making by director and editor will pascoe ,  who in the dvd's filmmaker statement ,  shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky's .  other than that ,  one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary ,  but mere agitprop ,  and a vanity piece of agitprop ,  at that ,  is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer .  he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds .   given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky's lectures at mcmaster university ,  in ontario ,  canada ,  prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 ,  much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era .  yes ,  he makes some good points ,  here and there ,  on american media complicity before the war ,  but he follows them up with sheer lunacy ,  for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc ,  and not fully plotted out cabals .  as example ,  he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace ,  but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled .  similarly ,  he claims trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result .  of course ,  that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers ,  and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume .  he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades ,  when castro and company were great sponsors of it ,  in latin america ,  asia ,  and africa ,  until the soviet union fell .  i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in idaho .   in his simpleminded world without grays ,  chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco ,  whom he reviles ,  are ;  even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals .  in short ,  chomsky is a man living in the past ,  in over his head on most issues ,  and out of his depth intellectually .  near this film's end he warns ,  'be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh ,  as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like ,  no matter how barbarous their crimes ,  and anti-intellectual their posit .  please ,  pause before you waste your time and money on this silly ,  and already irrelevant ,  dvd .
-1	first off ,  i agree with quite a bit that escapes mr .  chomsky's mouth .  his matter-of-fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus .  he comes across likable ,  unassuming ,  pragmatic .  he doesn't cater to the current political style  ( obnoxious bi-partisanship )  and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right ,  chastising both ,  and for good reason .   unfortunately ,  the film itself is a dud .  in fact ,  i would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches .  watching  " rebel without a pause "  is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on cspan .  there are no camera movements ,  no edits ,  no stylistic touches .  there is no story ,  no narrative .   technically speaking ,  the production is strictly amateurish .  audio is terrible and inconsistent ;  sometimes we cannot hear noam speak ,  other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance .  when noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her .   i cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or cd to listen to in the car .   4 out of 10 stars .  .  . and i'm in a generous mood today .
-1	a documentarist ,  like any filmmaker ,  must convey a compelling story .  will pascoe fails utterly in this effort ,  cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky's wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton .  the footage is shot amateurishly and in video .  pascoe's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen :   " 9-11 ,  "   " activism ,  "   " truth .  "   lame .   compare this with documentaries like  " the corporation "  or  " the fog of war "  which create a narrative drawing material from interviews ,  stock footage ,  and filmed footage .  in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently .   the only saving graces of the film are chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma ,  and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes .   one of the more interesting passages was chomsky's recounting of his experience with national public radio .  he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views ,  while npr's liberal dogma strait-jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages .  yet another media outlet to be skeptical of .   this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only .
-1	hopalong cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named topper ?  go figure !   this travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes ,  hopalong cassidy .  the actor who plays him is young versus old ,  blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands .  will the real hopalong please stand up !   one of the worst movies ever made & , believe it or not ,  by the person who brought us the grandfather saga !
-1	except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads ,  this movie is really ,  really bad .  the cheap production values don't help .  of course ,  you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with .  even for a b-movie genre freak like myself ,  this movie really sucks .
-1	this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick .  the video is dark and poorly lit .  the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed .  the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun !  [filled of course with silver bullets] .  the acting is as wooden as the characters .  the fx are non-existent , lots of extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting .  the only thing that is shown is lots of soft-core t&a .  instead of dropping $30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic :   " dog soldiers "  with sean pertwee .
-1	what more can i say ?  the acting was ,  almost without exception ,  amateurish .  the directing and continuity were pitiful .  the sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious .  one of the features on the dvd was labeled  " gag reel "  but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie .   one of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the dvd .  he said ,  with a straight face ,  that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast - and that he had succeeded .  with delusions like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did .   perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster .  the darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit  ( per the 'making of' feature on the dvd )  and rather looked it .  the mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store .  the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game .
-1	this is only the second time i've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film .  the first time was for probably the best movie i've ever seen and that was for memento .   seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento ,  as in the worst film i've had the misfortune to see .  apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash-pile that it is .   let's see ,  apalling effects ,  cliched script ,  bad acting and about 90 minutes too long .  my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad .  amazingly i watched it to the end ,  how i did that i don't know !  avoid !  !  !
-1	all the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish .  with the derisory acting ,  equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match ;  this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre .  it is supposed to be serious ,  which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke .   this is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent .  avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies instead .   0 out of 10 !
-1	let me start by saying that i'd read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect .  still ,  i was surprised by just how bad it was .    i am a big werewolf fan ,  and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one .  most of them have sub-par effects ,  poor acting ,  and weak storylines  ( at best rehashed from earlier films )  .  so far ,  with the possible exception of some of the later  " howling "  series films ,  this is the worst of the lot .   first ,  the story .  it's been quoted several times in reviews on this site ,  so i won't go into specifics .  however ,  it is very obvious that the writer ( s )  had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters .  as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves  " above "  such fare ,  they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos .  that's fine ,  but a non-horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them .  the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films ,  and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted .  tv news footage ,  for example ,  never pans away from the reporter to close-up on someone in the crowd behind them .  give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign .  and that's just the tip of the iceberg .   as for effects ,  i have never seen a less believable werewolf .  i'd have been happier with lon chaney jr .  in crepe hair .  the beast they used look a great deal like .  .  .  well ,  like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics .  and ,  i know that many people have already criticized the cg ,  but my god it was awful .  one scene features a woman changing ,  and starts with a completely cg version of the actress ,  nude but for some reason without nipples .  my first thought was ,   " hey ,  why is one of the characters from 'reboot' turning into a silly looking werewolf ?  "   anyway ,  i like to look for positives in any film ,  and there were a few .  the cinematography was passable  ( the film was shot all-digital ,  which is interesting )  and some of the performances were not terrible .  it was also interesting seeing tippi hedron as the world's most well made-up homeless woman ,  and kane hodder as the title bad guy .  also ,  the yellow power ranger got all growed up and .  .  .  well ,  damn .  and if you're looking for skin ,  there's some pretty tasty examples .  this ends the male-pig segment of the review .   overall ,  if you want a good werewolf film ,  try  " an american werewolf in london "  ,  the original  " the howling "  ,   " dog soldiers "  ,  or even  " the wolfen "   ( though that one's got more wolf than were )  .  if you're a lycanthrope completest ,  then take a gander .  otherwise ,  give this one a miss .
-1	there isn't much to say about this film ,  it is horrible .   the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent ,  the story of the hybrid werewolf's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there .   cgi is something you wouldn't like to see .  it so amateurish that it makes me vomit .   the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras .  the gag reel .  everything else ,  just waste of time and money .  i hope noone will buy this ,  this is not even worth renting .   just stay away of this .
-1	i thought i was going to watch a scary movie .  .  and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie .  in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding .  todays computer games have ten times better animations .  low budget ,  is a fitting comment .  i would recommend wolf  ( 1994 )  with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie .  it has good special effects as they should be  ( human transforming to werewolf )  .  unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie .  this movie is a joke .
-1	man ,  this movie sucked big time !  i didn't even manage to see the hole thing  ( my girlfriend did though )  .  really bad acting ,  computer animations so bad you just laugh  ( woman to werewolf )  ,  strange clips ,  the list goes on and on .  don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie ?  and i don't mean all the naked ladys .  .  .  it's something about the light or something .  .  .  this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women ,  but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist .  my final words are :  don't see it !  it's not worth the time .  if you wanna see it because the nakedness there's lots of better ones to see !
-1	this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch - actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it  : - )   the cgi is sooo bad it's fun !  it's not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn ,  that's how bad it is ,  har har har .  .  .   i'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd ,  but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way ,  'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars .   it's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it .   see it and laugh !
-1	hi ,  i'm a friend of werewolf movies ,  and when i saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like  " hmm ,  simple and nice name to it at least .  althou .  .  .  i wonder why i haven't heard of it before .  "   first of all ,  the movie starts with tits .  lots of tits .  tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to .  who cares about a werewolf effect ,  just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots !   so ,  about the mysterious darkwolf character  ( a little spoilers ahead ,  but who really cares .  .  .  )  he's your average everyday biker .  not even super-tough looking ,  but like the old wise woman says in the movie  " he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before .  "  just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy .  pretty original .  i even had look twice when they first used the  " red glowing eyes "  special effect !  i mean my god ,  that  " lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer "  effect has been used since the seventies .  it looks plain ugly here !  and don't get me started with the werewolf 3d-cgi .  as said before ,  like an bad and old video game .   and finally ,  as i do like werewolf films ,  like i said .  they prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own .  darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well ,  about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline .  but .  it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement  " the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched "  starts random-slashing .  which just doesn't make any sense ,  why even bother telling us the rules of killing ,  when they aren't even gonna play by them .  .  .  aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something ,  filming mostly the floor and walls .  just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect .  the gore is partially ok .  but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand ,  just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims ,  it just doesn't do the trick for me .  .  .   truly ,  who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles ,  they aren't even funny-kind of bad movies ,  just sad .
-1	in this day and age of incredible special movie effects ,  this one was a sore disappointment .  the actors seemed stiff and uninspired ,  as was the dialogue .  westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days ,  but movies like  " silverado "  prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one .  considering that ,  it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing ,  much less creating such a weak film as this one .  if you love and are looking for a good western ,  keep looking !
-1	this flick reminded me of those lame  " erotic thrillers "  i used to stay up late and watch on cinemax when i was 13 .  i'd label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder .  there is ,  however ,  a ton of nudity- the opening scene is in a strip club ,  we see kane hodder's keester  ( or at least a stunt butt )  and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the munster's for a costume .  13 year old boys rejoice .   other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst cgi i've seen in years .  the shots look like fmv's from the video game resident evil in terms of quality .  the wolf is too bad to be explained and ,  despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way ,  way too many times .   the plot and acting make no sense .  there is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- the darkwolf is the latter but from what i can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do- look human ,  change to a wolf an kill people .  the darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches .  once more ,  this skills proves less than useful since the darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched ,  met or even saw as best i can tell .  the mate doesn't know she's a werewolf and she's fighting the transformation or something .   you'd think it'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but ,  well they did .  want quality low-end werewolf-ism ,  go rent dog soldiers want a ton of t&a this is your flick .
-1	where to start  ?  !   .   .   .  i feel  .  .  .  violated !  thats right ,  violated !  i just spent 1 . 5hrs of my life ,  1 . 5hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful ,  like watching paint dry ,  on this so called horror flick .   its not scary ,  its not funny ,  its not dramatic ,  its no action ,  its nothing .  .  .   its predictable ,  its boring ,  its tragic .  .  .   i might come of a bit harsh here ,  but watch this movie and you will feel the same way  .  .  .  or  .  .  .  no ,  don't watch it .  .  . unless you want to feel violated also .
-1	well ,  no ,  not really .  its not really a good movie ,  but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be .  i really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money ,  and sometimes thats all you can ask for .  the plot is ok ,  nothing brilliant or new ,  the acting is pretty bad ,  but the cast is pretty .  the directing is passable ,  but the effects are horrible ,  especially the werewolf effects ,  which in a werewolf movie ,  is a pretty big problem .  there was a fairly decent amount of nudity ,  which to me is a pretty good thing ,  but it wasn't all that hot .  all in all ,  its a fairly average direct to video movie ,  not the worst film i've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan ,  check it out sometime .  i'd even watch it again .   bonus fact for horror geeks ,  kane hodder  ( jason vorhees in a few of them )  plays the werewolf .
-1	i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting ,  instead of watching this  " movie "   .  .  .  anything will do ,  even stare at the walls is better .   and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text ,  i tell you also is a low budget movie ,  bad acting ,  no name actors ,  a stupid mutt as the wolf ,  and so on .  .  .  also the story brings nothing new ,  the special effects are made in the 80's style .   the movie is almost as bad as the movie  " megalodon "  .   so have fun !   ;  )   ( not watching this movie )
-1	this is the prime example of low budget ,  winning over what would be a good story line .  let's bring back samaire armstrong  ( having seen her work on the o . c .  i know she can do better )  ,  then find a better script and budget .   the special effects were so bad ,  and mostly badly computer generated ,  that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on-screen .  and samaire armstrong's  ( alert !  ) changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change ( final fantasy's humans ,  as well as pixar's made these laughable ,  think of the figure as a nude barbie doll )  .   the story of was interesting ,  though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new .  as it also got into the balance between evil ,   ( maybe )  not so evil ,  and the possible end of human-kind should the two lines mate .  the subplot of a  " book of werewolf linage "  which effected some of the other characters in a spell-like manner for a while was effective ,  but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past .    bring in a better script and direction ,  and i'd come back again .
-1	recap :  full moon .  a creature ,  a huge werewolf ,  is on the hunt .  not for flesh ,  not for blood  ( not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though )  ,  but for a mate .  he is on the hunt for a girl .  not any girl though .  the girl .  the girl that is pure  ( and also a werewolf ,  although she doesn't know it yet )  .  three ,  well check that ,  two cops  ( after the first scene )  and an old bag lady is all that can stop it ,  or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf .  this particular powerful werewolf ,  darkwolf ,  is closing in on the girl .  if he gets her ,  mankind is doomed .  now the cops has to find the girl ,  convince her not only that there is someone ,  a werewolf nonetheless ,  that wants to rape her ,  and perhaps kill her ,  but that she is a werewolf herself .  and then they got to stop him .  .  .   comments :  this is one for the boys ,  the teenage boys .  a lot of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot .  mostly less .  well i guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is  ( expectedly )  thin .  and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking .  one usually turns to two main themes .  nudity .  check .  and then special effects .  hmm .  .  .  well there are some things that you might call effects .  they're not very special though .  in fact ,  to be blunt ,  they are very bad .  the movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds .  they couldn't afford clothes for some of the girls  ;  )  ,  and the effects are cheap .  some of the transformations between werewolf and human form ,  obviously done by computer ,  are really bad .  you might overlook such things .  but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too ,  and you never get to see any killings .  just some mutilated corpses afterwards .  and there is surprisingly little blood about ,  in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood .   i'm not sure what to say about actors and characters .  most of the times they do well ,  but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters  ( or actors )  just looses it .  a few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above .  like the poor effects ,  or the poor budget (  ?  )  .  that could explain why there is precious little shooting ,  even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight  ( and not moving )  .  but hey ,  when you're in real danger ,  there nothing that will save your life like a good one-liner .  .  .   unfortunately that can't explain moments when the cop ,  steve ,  the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem ,  the werewolf that is ,  runs away ,  when the only things he can be sure of ,  is that the werewolf is coming for the girl ,  who is just beside him now ,  and that he cannot let it have her .  but sure ,  it let the makers stretch the ending a little more .  .  .   but i wouldn't mind seeing none of the lead actors/actresses get another try in another movie .   well .  to give a small conclusion :  not a movie that i recommend .   3/10
-1	my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video .  although it had great actors/actresses ,  there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest .  plus it just wasn't that interesting .  dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable .  i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn's last movies .  i'll always love john ritter best in slapstick .  he was just too pathetic here .
-1	i watched this film alone ,  in the dark ,  and it was full moon outside !  i didn't do it in purpose ,  it just happened in this way .  so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me !  !  well ,  it didn't ,  in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes ,  but i thought come on give it a chance ,  unfortunately i did .  the acting was awful ,  the only one with some decent acting was samaire armstrong .  the plot is not original ,  if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before .  some scenes didn't make sense at all ,  and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer !  the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie .  the  ( scary )  scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology ,  yet some good movies were made back then !  i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie ,  i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent ?  !  !  i couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got ,  it is also my rating for it ,  3 out of 10 .
-1	darkwolf tells the tale of a young waitress named josie  ( samaire armstrong )  who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary  ( tippi hedren )  is killed by a werewolf ,  you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america & there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve turley  ( ryan olosio )  who has the difficult task of telling josie that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself & that a so-called 'dark prince' werewolf  ( kane hodder )  wants to mate with her & create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world ,  or something like that .  understandably josie has a hard time believing it ,  that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes .  it's up to werewolf cop steve to save josie ,  the day & the world .  .  .   co-executive produced & directed richard friedman i thought darkwolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me .  the script by geoffrey alan holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show & then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid .  for a start it's slow going ,  it's dull ,  it's predictable & it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue & do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't ,  i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead .  the script is dumb & doesn't explain itself ,  why has josie never turned into a werewolf before ?  is she really the only one ?  why can't this 'dark prince' find another female werewolf ?  there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half-way through but you get the idea anyway ,  as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least .   director friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original & doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle .  now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in darkwolf are far from special ,  the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi & it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen ,  seriously a playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics .  it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen ,  an american werewolf in london  ( 1981 )  was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light-years ahead of the ones seen in darkwolf ,  who says special effects have improved over the years ?  the animatronic puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something psychical on screen .  the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter & plenty of dead bodies but not much else .  thre's a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it ,  is it really worth it ?   technically darkwolf is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever ,  it's reasonably well made & it at least seems to have production values .  the acting is what you'd expect really .   darkwolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves & clutter the schedules of obscure cable tv stations ,  i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said & done they're both horrible still .  .  .
-1	we saw this on the shelf at the local video store ,  saw  " coppola "  in the credits and got excited .  that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest .  i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably ,  or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably .  in general ,  the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish .  the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful ,  especially in the scenes shot in the little bar ;  the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable .  very disappointing .
-1	why bother seeing this movie ,  if you have great movies to see .  it is a total waste of time and money .  the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it .  everything in it is bad .  actors were bad .  script was really bad .  the story is stupid .  and the worst cgi ever .  the only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club .  one interesting thing that ,  there is a characther that we wish that he dies because ,  he is so stupid that we get enough of him .  ( i don't remember the name but was the boyfriend of the  " chosen one "  .  )   note : if you want to see a good movie ,  this movie isn't the right choice .  0-stars out of 10
-1	another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story .  within 15 minutes ,  the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines ,  so there is absolutely no mystery ,  which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense .  the only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film ,  so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things .  low budget films can't afford expensive special effects ,  so the cgi portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive ,  but were at least a valid attempt .  the creature suit is terrible ,  as seen when it falls to the sidewalk ,  and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes ,  which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots .  the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired ,  with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator .  the last action sequence takes place in a police station ,  also a rip-off from terminator ,  with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the darkwolf doesn't smash into .  in the end ,  the girl calls the hero  " a good protector "  ,  but he gets both his partners ,  the original protector ,  and at least three other civilians ,  not to mention a dozen cops ,  all killed without getting a decent shot off ,  in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun .  but here's the real clincher for bad writing :  they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes .  instead ,  they took it into custody ?  !  ?
-1	this move was on tv last night .  i guess as a time filler ,  because it sucked bad !  the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way .   ( not bad tits and ass though )  .  but the story is too ridiculous for words .  the  " wolf "  ,  if that is what you can call it ,  is hardly shown fully save his teeth .  when it is fully in view ,  you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi ,  because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill ,  and the cgi fur looks like it's been waxed ,  all shiny  :  )   the movie is full of gore and blood ,  and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next .  even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed ,  they didn't do a good job at it .   don't even get me started on the actors .  .  .  very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds .  but then again ,  if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks ,  then hey ,  where do i sign up ?   overall boring and laughable horror .
-1	the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library  ( and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it )  ,  and despite the plethora of tits and ass ,  it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend .  terrible direction ,  pedestrian camera work ,  sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting ,  chintzy effects ,  and one of the worst screenplays i've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life  ( such as it was ,  horribly crippled and mutilated )  in a long ,  long time .  best laughs actually come from the  " making of .  .  .  "  featurette ,  in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special ,  instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week .  wait !  except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi  " the birds "  hedren ,  of all people ,  into doing a bit part ,  along with kane  " friday the 13th "  hodder !  how this came to pass ,  i'll never know ,  and to be honest ,  i don't really care .  watch at your own risk ,  and don't say you haven't been warned .  this is film-making at its pretentious ,  craven worst .  it only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women ,  and even then ,  just barely .
-1	dark wolf  ( quick review )  let's get right to it :  this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it .  it's just an awful movie .  it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film .  what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf .  kane f*cking hodder .  someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career .  .  .   anyway ,  former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf ,  too .  it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it .  but it does have moments of near-rampant nudity .  but that's about all .  want to know more ?  okay ,  the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur zipping around the screen .  and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence ,  we're presented with something that resembles a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation .  the first playstation .  the cg animation is really that primitive .  only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit .  2/10  www . residenthazard . com
-1	hip .  erotic .  wickedly sexy  .  .  .  whatever .  it's  " the terminator "  with werewolves .   no ,  seriously .  the cop saves the girl  ( waitress !  )  from the big monster and refers to himself as her 'protector' .  the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese  .  .  .  there's a massacre in a police precinct  .  .  .  the bad guy is muscular with red eyes  .  .  .  and it even contains dialogue along the lines of  " you said it yourself ,  he won't ever stop .  never .  "  the dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who ,  thank god ,  hasn't sold anything since this ,  and it's all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman .   the movie opens in a strip bar  ( always a good sign )  ,  and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason ,  pursued by three cops .  one of them is black ,  and  ( shock horror !  )  he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes .  the film goes downhill for the next hour or so ,  then picks up a little with some decent action sequences ,  before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending .   for the most part ,  the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less .  if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio ,  along with some of the supporting cast ,  shows signs of talent .  darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the 'friday the 13th' movies .  he's decent enough ,  especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles .   it's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams ,  who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former 'power rangers' actresses .  and it's unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene  .  .  .  anyway ,  the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good ,  and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all . but the cgi is bad .  just plain bad .  i mean seriously ,  if you can't reach some level of realism - why bother ?  just throw a little extra money into the make-up !  aside from the terrible script ,  this movie does have it's moments ,  many of which are unintentionally funny .  it's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do ,  but just don't spend any money on it .  please .
-1	what a horrible ,  horrible film .  the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time .  not that i saw much .  i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves .  meryl streep was awful as usual .  how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have ?  aidan quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted .  and who told gloria estefan she could act ?  trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes .   ( brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school )  .  the kids weren't even cute !  just written in to suit the appalling script .  aaargh !  wes craven really made me cringe for once .  real horror this one !
-1	i saw this movie at a 'sneak preview' and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much .  this picture was the worst .  half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film .  i couldnt blame them ,  if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture .  just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear .
-1	this kind of  " inspirational "  saccharine is enough to make you sick .  it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth .  it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it .  the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car ;  i guess you'd need such prompting to feel if you're stupid enough to watch a film as simple-minded and sappy as this .  streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that---a display ,  switched on and off like a light .  because i can't for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film .  even though it's based on a true story ,  and an inspirational one at that i'm sure ,  the set-up ,  execution and performances play like a third-rate tv movie or half-witted high school drama .
-1	" nacho libre "   ( 2006 )    directed by :  jared hess   starring :  jack black ,  ana de la reguera ,  héctor jiménez ,  & darius rose   mpaa rating :   " pg-13 "   ( for some rough action ,  and crude humor including dialog )    say what you will about it  ( i know some people who despise it to no end )  ,  but i have always thought that  " napoleon dynamite "  was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall ,  but a funny movie ,  nonetheless .  jack black is also a very funny man--irritating at times ,  yes ,  and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him ,  but funny .  there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree .  so ,  i was very happy to hear that jared hess ,  the writer and director of  " napoleon dynamite "  ,  and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage .  my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin .  unfortunately ,  my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie .  this plot ,  had it been done as a skit on some such show as  " saturday night live "  or possibly even  " mad tv "  ,  would have worked flawlessly .  unfortunately ,  the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat .   nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord .  feeling shunned by the entire monastery ,  nacho  ( black )  ,  now the monastery's cook ,  decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler .  as the monastery's finances hit an all-time low ,  nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage .  this plot sounds so sweet and caring .  it seems like the perfect movie for jack black .  look what he did with  " school of rock "  after all .  well ,  to my displeasure ,  this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie .  it is again hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course ,  for all i know ,  maybe that is the general thought of teenagers ,  as many seemed to enjoy this movie .  watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh ,  but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie .  a seven-year-old could make up the same joke .   the performances in  " nacho libre "  are actually good .  jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic ,  worthless lines in ever put on paper comical .  unfortunately ,  this movie just wasn't enough for him .  it didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him .  i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before ,  but now i can say that ,  not only is she quite talented ,  but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight .  she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well .  héctor jiménez ,  who plays nacho's bumbling partner ,  esqueleto ,  kept me laughing continuously .  he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack black's .  darius rose ,  who plays an orphan named chancho ,  didn't have many lines ,  but ,  what can i say ,  i just enjoyed him .  he was adorable .  the rest of the cast did their job .  it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie .    " nacho libre "  just does not work .  its plot is stretched far too thin .  the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work .  i very rarely laughed and ,  if i did ,  it was because of jack black or another member of the cast .  and that leads me to the bright side of  " nacho libre "  :  yes ,  the cast .  this cast was justwell ,  for lack of a better word ,  they were on .  they all clicked ,  had excellent chemistry together ,  and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script .  after jared hess's  " napoleon dynamite "  kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie ,  i was surprised to find myself so often bored with  " nacho libre "  .  something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was .  all i know is that  " nacho libre "  is not a good movie and yet ,  because of its cast ,  it is completely worthless .  there is a small reason to watch ,  if only to watch jack black work .  but ,  if you are not a fan of jack black ,  then avoid this movie like the plague .  i like black ,  but i am done with this movie and with this review .   final thought :  yikes !  this is jared hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical  " napoleon dynamite "  .   overall rating :  4/10  ( c+ )
-1	jack black is an annoying character . this is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds . do i have to write eight more lines ? ana de la reguera is dang fine to look at , as a mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of jack black . this movie is a pg 13 version of an indie film . i really like a movie that has the courage to explore mexican culture . this movie explores mexican culture-deeply .  i just choke on its cultural rudeness : jack black is just so rude .  a white person like jack black is not my most valuable emissary into mexican culture ,  as it were . mexican wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy ,  such as myself could seek . i suspect mexico is more culturally opaque than jack black has presented here .   i think imdb changed my review . has anyone else had his review changed as well ? just a question .
-1	we loved school of rock and jack black .  we couldn't wait to go and see this movie .  it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out .  my husband hated it too .  the only funny parts were in the trailers .  my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money .  the writing was awful .  it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended .  the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity .  the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry .  i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts ,  but there weren't .  save you money and your time .
-1	this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family .  it doesn't seem to know whether to be an  " a "  or a  " b "  western .  i mean ,  the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god's sake .  william boyd must be spinning in his grave .   all the  " b "  western cliches are here .  the two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed  (  " c'mon thunder "  )  ,  the all-in-black bearded villain ,  the heroine in distress ,  the rancher in trouble ,  the cowardly sheriff ,  over the top bad guys etc .   the acting ,  with few exceptions ,  is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting .  chris lybbert  ( who ?  )  as the hero and louis schweibert  ( who ?  )  as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's poverty row quickie .  the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen ,  robert carradine ,  clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little ,  but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one .   what was the point of the martin sheen/robert carradine framing sequences ?  are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost ?  what was the purpose of the black gloves ?  it just didn't make sense .   being a great lover of westerns from all genres ,  i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film .  the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic .  aside from the hero and main villain ,  the other characters looked authentic .   if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character ,  they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder ,  the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in .   what else can i say but .  . on thunder ,  on big fellow .
-1	what a disappointment !   this film seemed to be trying to copy 'cutting edge' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy ,  sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition .  jack black's acting/role was self-indulgent and self-regarding .  .  .  and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting .  the soundtrack was tedious .  we are  (  were )  fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration .  why did he feel he needed to make this mistake ?   we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first !  !   was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel ?
-1	i mean ,  really .  .  .  either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie .  it's stupid ,  ridiculous and just not funny at all .   since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie ,  i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad .  .  .   what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie ?  when the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny ?  .  now we find ourselves with movies like this one ,  borat ,  little men ,  scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts !  !   just skip this piece of garbage  p . s .   ( sorry for my english )
-1	i'm sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't .  you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy ,  slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department .   i just sat there through most of the movie thinking  " is this supposed to be funny "  and  " this is the guy from tenacious d right ?  "  .  the truth is this film has nothing to offer .  at all !  it's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction .  you'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't .  i was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up .  it didn't .  90 minutes later i'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful .   it's like ,  remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it ,  even some of their really early pap from before they were famous ,  and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop .  yeah it's like that .   i've enjoyed some of jack black's earlier movies like shallow hall and i'm really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man .  if you do this to us again jack i'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something .  at the least give you a serious talking to .   i know it's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and for so many reasons .  .  .  .
-1	jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing ,  but in this movie .  .  .   besides the direction ,  writing ,  lack of plot ,  constant mugging  ( aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots )  ,  and a  . 050 joke batting average ,  it was still an utter waste of time .  the idea sounds promising ,  but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i've seen this side of you-tube .   i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively .  while that's no doubt true ,  i really don't think this movie is meant to be racist .  i think that's it's more a result of a  " creative "  team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess .  you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera :   " hey look ,  it's an ugly mexican !  laugh ,  people !  please ,  for the love of all things tenacious ,  laugh !  "   but put the racism charges aside .  when you get down to it ,  it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended ,  imo .
-1	- a mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -  i went to see this movie because it was about non-wwf wrestling and so i thought it might be funny .  it wasn't .  it is excruciating to watch .  embarrassing .  any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered .    i admit i don't like jack black anyway .  after this i have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed .  the only thing i can come up with where he was o . k .  was as a necessary foil to the john cusack character in 'high fidelity' .  jack black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guys  ( like the little fat one in abbot & costello or jerry lewis )  who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny .    it is not even slapstick .  it's just irritating .  it's not even stoopid ,  it's just stupid .   i heard good things about napoleon dynamite too ,  but if this is anything to go by i wont be rushing out to find it on dvd .
-1	are you kidding me ?  !  a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal ?  how talented do you have to be to do this ?  she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production .  i know she has a martha-stewart-esquire empire .  so does warren buffett but i don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo .   she has a nephew named .  .  . brycer .  brycer ?  stop talking about anyone a name that stupid .   more time is spent on  " table-scapes "  than actual cooking .  who has that kind of time ?  !  silicon should be on your spatula ,  not on my tv .  this show should be on cartoon network ,  not food network .
-1	there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the 1977 toronto film festival .  it is dull ,  plodding and lacking in suspense .   peter oÕtooleÕs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of interest .   note  :  some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson ,  best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series ,  in one of his earliest roles .  .  .  .
-1	very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue ,  bad flashbacks ,  and an almost entirely male cast .  the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men .   o'toole is riveting whenever he speaks ;  unfortunately ,  he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery .  alastair sims is always a joy to see but he ,  too ,  is terribly underused .   the film has one additional positive aspect ,  in that it depicts many aspects of british fascism and fascist sympathies  ( such as the casual appearance of the mosley graffiti )  that many people today are unaware of .  too many of today's films about wwii paint the allies as all-good and the axis as all-evil ,  when history tells us people are far more complicated than that !   this would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex .  if you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize ,  this is the movie for you .
-1	i don't know what this movie is about ,  really .  it's like a student's art school project .  they never say why the world is dark ,  but it is always darkness except for seconds a day .  there are long ,  interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason .  what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images .  a black woman enters the main character's apartment .  somehow she becomes pregnant overnight ,  then gets shot in the head .  the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges .  i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be .  honestly ,  i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about .  but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else .
-1	2002's undeservedly popular  " i love the 80's "  is an inane ,  idiotic ,  offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1 ,  which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on tv !  i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter ,  i forget which one now ,  of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever .  out of sheer morbid curiosity  ( i'd guess that's what you'd call it )  i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap .  at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with .  the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular  ( which is what i was expecting to see )  ,  but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes* .  .  . more like lack-thereof if you ask me !  it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called  " humor "  that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another !  altogether ,  i have no problem in saying that  " i love the 80's "  was/is trash of the lowest denominator ,  and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore .
-1	if it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script .  i mean ,  the direction was really in touch with it's subject .  the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life .  but in the end ,  the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together .  i would highly suggest not to watch this .  unless you're a al pacino enthusiast like i am and will watch everything he is playing in .  even if the result lately are rather poor .  this is ,  after s1m0ne ,  a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles .
-1	al pacino ?  kim basinger ?  tea leoni ?  ryan o'neal ?  richard schiff ?  my mouth was watering .  i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable .  30 minutes in i was having trouble staying awake .  60 minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep .  finished watching it the next morning .  shouldn't have bothered .  what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a  " day in the life .  .  .  "  cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie .  i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep .  dialogue horrible .  continuity non-existent .  camera work could have been done with a hand held super 8 and looked better .    this movie was a total disaster .
-1	unless somebody enlightens me ,  i really have no idea what this movie is about .  it looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it .  this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems .  and ,  that´s basically all .  when that agent is played by pacino ,  one must think that it must be something important .  but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is .  to one of the best actors in the world ,  al pacino ,  this is the second movie of the year  ( the other is  " simone "  )  that deserves the title  " the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year "  .  so ,  what´s going on ,  al ?
-1	saw this movie in an early preview ,  and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was .  from the very beginning ,  the audience was groaning over pacino's awful southern accent .  poor al looked really ,  really haggard ,  and i can't decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist ,  or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set .  much worse than pacino's close ups ,  however ,  is the wretched excuse for a plot .  early in the film we are given indications that pacino's character is gay ,  and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended .  later ,  however ,  we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both tea leoni and kim basinger  ( both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles )  lust after this elderly ,  half dead looking ,  effeminate man with the ridiculous accent .  the worst part overall was the main plot thread ,  which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ,  ever care about in the slightest .  because this was a preview i will reserve my final judgment ,  because of the possibility of re-shoots and editing ,  but you can bet i will not pay a cent to see this in theaters .
-1	in what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 i've had to endure in a long time ,  al pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure .  not his usual typecasting ,  which was nice .  but his character was just truely pathetic .  someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy .  but in this movie we needed someone to like .  and for some reason ,  every character in the picture said  " i don't know why i like you ,  eli "  to al pacino's chracter and i couldn't even come close to liking him .   all the other actors played their usual styles .  tea leoni ,  richard schiff ,  and bill nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on tv or in earlier films .  and kim basinger wasn't even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind .   the movie's story had no momentum .  most scenes never driving the story forward ,  but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti-climactic ending .  it had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story .   whats the point of the film ?  daniel algrant and jon robin baitz would have you believe  " once hollywood has you ,  you can't get out .  "  yeah right !  and that's why so many people get fired in hollywood .
-1	firstly , i must admit that it isn't a good movie .  and , i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in it .   the movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours . and he is overworked , dizzy , sick and sometimes regretful . i don't like the character at all . it's really boring , after 20 minutes you may fall asleep . and i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie . just because of money or what ?   since i'm an avid pacino fan , i bought this 2002 movie people i know . if you haven't bought it yet , don't even think about it , it's just a waste of time .
-1	much as we all love al pacino ,  it was painful to see him in this movie .  a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent .   the plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels  ( and then retreats )  .   kim basinger is there ,  not doing much .  her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing .  hard to believe they meant a lot to each other .  there's no energy there .   tea leone ,  on the other hand ,  lit up the screen .  she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie ,  but not enough to save al from embarrassment .
-1	the only good thing about  " people i know "  is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in .  the first big turn-off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent ;  at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone .  dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot .  the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting ,  and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot .  the story overall is a real bore ,  and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake .   this movie will surely bore you as well .  .  . avoid at all costs .
-1	the movie is about two stories :  one is a political murder of a call-girl ,  the other an upper-class political party .  the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino ,  as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening .   if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama ,  the performance of al is memorable :  how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man  ( as  " the godfather "  )  as here as a little servant  ( see also  " donnie brasco "  )  .   actually ,  the big young lion has become a tired old one .  this passing of ages is very moving ,  because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too .   but his slowness is only a make-up because he can get back his energy in church scene .   maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al's talent !
-1	i was really horrified by this eerie movie .  what an unusual dark atmosphere .  and such a creepy musical score .  really promising !  indeed ,  after ten minutes you really start sweating ,  and feeling uncomfortable ,  for you start fearing the worst .  this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare ,  and what's worse-it all comes out .  for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep ,  but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake .  nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes ,  your ears ,  your intelligence ,  and most of all :  your wallet ,  since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all .
-1	very silly movie ,  filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out .  it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously .  a familiar movie plot .  .  . being at the wrong place at the wrong time .  an atrocious subplot ,  involving kim bassinger .  very robotic and too regimented .  i have noticed that al pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill .  a troubleshooter with troubles  ,  but nothing more troubling than pacinos horrible atlanta accent .  damage control needs to fix this damage of a film .  ok my one liners are bad ,  but not as bad as the ones in this film .  this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well .  usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons .  this movie is unwatchable .  i did manage to sit through this .  the plot  , if written a tad bit better ,  with  ,  perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot , and even dumber jokes ,  could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums .  what we are left with is a dull ,  silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that eli wurman was jewish .  an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere .
-1	" people i know "  is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast .   pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman ,  a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption .  but unlike michael corleone ,  it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character ,  his dilemma ,  or his fate .   the film traces eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause ,  while distracted by a client's  ( ryan o'neal ,  good in an underwritten part )  latest  " dirty laundry "  -- in this case ,  a tv actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people .  tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role ,  although again ,  the script doesn't give her much to work with .  as eli's sister-in-law ,  kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics .   this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff ,  and enjoy the other principals .  unfortunately ,  between the script and direction ,   " people i know "  is strictly amateurish .  hence its limited theatrical release ,  and speedy journey to dvd .  consider yourself warned .
-1	this is a truly terrible film .   i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it .  if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy .   unutterably dull ,  although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen .  then the credits rolled ,  and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel .   i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb  ( over 5 stars when i last saw the voting )  .  are you people voting ironically ?   please ,  please ,  please do not watch this film !
-1	yes ,  mtv there really is a way to market daria .  what started as a clever teenage angst- " comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life "  sitcom now mutated into a  " how you should deal with your problems " -charade .  i used to watch daria all the time and loved it .  now ,  sitting here after watching the so called  " movie "  i can only wonder what the point of this all was .  daria tells us how to lead out life in college ?  excuse me ?  didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok ,  as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ?  this entire thing reminded me of the scene in  " reality bites "  the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time .
-1	i wanted to watch this movie ,  but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off .  character's don't seem to react to anything .  consider this :  heath ledger is walking a night  ( through a cemetery i believe )  when he is attacked by spirits ,  which he drives away .  once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all .  when asked what happen he says blandly  " attacked by demons ,  nothing serious .  "  ,  as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire .   i shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something ,  i stopped caring-a ques ion .  the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death ,  and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing ,  dying body question .   0 out of **** stars .
-1	the orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character's simply don't resonate or even react .   two examples :  a priest ,  walking through a graveyard late at night ,  is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits .  after fighting them off ,  he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up .   " anything wrong ?  "  his buddy asks ,  having seen the attack .   " just some demonic spirits-nothing i couldn't handle .  "  no reaction ,  no surprise ,  just like he'd changed a tire .  his buddy is equally unconcerned .  .  .  must be standard priest training .  .  .  [ " and then you put the wafer into their mouths .  any questions ?  ok ,  moving on ,  demon spirit attacks .  .  .  " ]  example two :  at one point the priests need an answer to a question ,  and only a demon  ( or something ,  who cared by now )  could provide it .  how ?  why ,  you have to ask a dying man !  so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing ,  gasping man .   " hey ,  don't kill him !  "  or maybe  " that's not nice !  "  would have been more realistic then their response .  they never ask that they let the man go or stop-in fact ,  the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance .  they ask their question and go .   i had to shut it off at that point-my brain was starting to atrophy .   avoid  * / ****  ( one star out of four )
-1	this really is the worst film i have ever seen .  ever .  period .  i actually paid £3 . 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie .  incredibly dull ,  poorly acted ,  dire script ,  often incoherent and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the overall film  ( like when heath ledger's priest partner get's nailed to a wall by a ghost .  .  . what was the point in that scene ?  answers on a postcard please .  .  .  )   i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it's entire running time .  i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again .   this should be cast into imdb's bottom 100 .  hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help it on it's way .
-1	always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world .  however ,  this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction .  there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell ;  all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen .  the actors ,  namely :  mark addy ,  thomas garrett ,  gave an outstanding performance in his native land england ,  and we have seen him in  " still standing "  a tv series .  heath ledger ,  played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in  " brokeback mountain "  , '05 ,  gave a great supporting role .  shannyn sossaman ,   ( mara sinclair )  ,  did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith .  don't waste your time ,  you will be sorry !
-1	first of all ,  i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven't seen .  taking this into account ,  i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made ,  it made me pine for gigli ,  my boss's daughter ,  and any other piece of junk you've ever seen .  belyt must be out of his mind ,  i've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about .  if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there's any other way a person could figure this crap out .   for the love of g-d stay away !
-1	the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named brother dominic  ( francesco carnelutti )  is found dead ,  cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier  ( heath ledger )  is contacted by top-brass cardinal driscoll  ( peter weller )  who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominic's death .  along with his girlfriend mara willims  ( shannyn sossamon )  & fellow priest thomas garrett  ( mark addy )  alex travels to italy to delve into his mentor's death ,  as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a 'sin eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the church wasn't happy about his activities .  alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes .  .  .   also know under the title the sin eater this american german co-production was written ,  produced & directed by bian helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if i'm honest & i usually am ,  honest that is .  anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it's throughly predictable ,  excruciatingly dull & boring ,  really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously .  the whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things .  there's the usual religious themes here ,  morality ,  sin ,  forgiveness ,  faith ,  belief ,  prophecy's ,  blah ,  blah ,  blah you know the sort of thing .  then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming ,  there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen ,  corruption ,  greed ,  evil ,  etc .  you know the sort of clichéd hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the church .  the order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks ,  a lot .  i'm not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to ,  as a die-hard horror fan i didn't see much horror in this at all ,  as a thriller it's less than thrilling ,  as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of sesame street  ( 1969 - present )  ,  harsh maybe but it's what i think .  .  .   director helgeland does an ok job ,  the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab ,  grayish & dull .  for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements ,  in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason ,  don't ask .  forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable .  according the imdb's 'trivia' section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny ,  all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now .   i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about $28 , 000 , 000 which is a hell of a lot of money & i just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good .  the whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable .  the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates ,  a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than this .   the order ,  i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much ,  misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it !  not recommended .
-1	even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film .  if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke .  .  .  .  . first off ,  jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor man's gerard depardieu .  .  .  .  . naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'iron mask' three musketeer one .  otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that .  the poor man's box office poison .  .  .  . really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised .  if the '4th man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie .  .  .  . what am i saying ?  it isn't .  let's just say hypothetically ,  if it was supposed to be ,  it wasn't sharp enough .  satire is a tricky thing .  .  .  . if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead .  .  .  .  .  . i think that is what happened .  the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either .  .  .  .  .  ( for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film .  .  .  . very sharp satire )   [potential spoiler alert]  really ,  the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbé's character works so so hard to attain .  .  .  .  do you even care ?  is it funny ?  since mr .  voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control .  .  .  .  . though i'm guessing he didn't cast jeroen krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass .  .  .  .  except he's incompetent at it .  so it becomes like a weird caricature .  do you think mr .  voerhoven did that on purpose ?  and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well ?  i just don't see it .  .  .  .  .  .  so you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right ?  it is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director .  so there is some kind of dupery involved .  i knew 'patch adams' was horrible without even seeing it .  do not be duped by 'the 4th man " s deceptively alluring packaging or mr .  voerhoven's reputation as a good director etc .  etc .
-1	i was not entirely impressed by this film .  it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film .  i'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it .  it was very slow and what was with picking robocop  ( peter weller )  as one of the main actors .  that was a sad point .   all in all i would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the catholic religion but don't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film .  it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out .
-1	ok ,  i didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths i could not imagine .   the plot ,  as it were ,  involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sin eater .  the sin eater allows for catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui .  nevermind that this makes no sense since then a baptist could give you salvation .  .  .  . we'll move on .   i'll layout the plot w/o giving much away :  the priest goes to rome with his buddy to investogate .  he brings with him a mental patient  ( i'm not making this up )  who shot him during an excorism and who loves him  ( not one lick of this btw is explained )  ,  a drunk irish priest and peter weller as a cardinal .  they get to rome ,  find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film ,  meet with a bondage gear s&m anti-pope that the drunk irish guy knows  ( not explained )  and who gives information by killing people  ( oh ,  btw ,  he's a bad guy so he has an industrial/techno soundtrack )  and then .  .  . umm ,  seriously ,  i'm not sure .  the plot meanders about .  heath chills with the sin eater ,  flies to new york with the sin eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then  ( all off camera )  the anti-pope falls and the film ends .   about 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened .  by the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off-scren you're really feeling cheated .
-1	the coming attractions to  " the order "  make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller ,  but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage .   first off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects .  the acting was also nothing to be proud of ,  but keath ledger  ( i think i spelled that right .  )  saved the movie in this category .   for heaven's sake :  don't see this movie !
-1	this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about  " gigli "  ,  that ben and jen flop earlier this summer .   " the order "  was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes ,  rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film ,  appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot .  now ,  i'm a heath ledger fan  (  " 10 things i hate about you "  ,   " a knight's tale "  and particularly his supporting role in  " monster's ball "  )  ,  but my man needs to find himself a better agent .  keep accepting scripts like  " the order "  and  " four feathers "  and he's going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion .   here are the problems i had with the film .  firstly ,  the director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with ,  well ,  much of anything .  plot skeins involving the american trying to take over the vatican and the dark pope ,  while mildly interesting ,  did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters .  the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best .  secondly ,  please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory .  we had manufactured angst ,  manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of  " matrix reloaded "  with skull-numbing techno music .  rather than developing character ,  these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were ,  a half-hearted attempt at putting popcorn-chewing adolescents in the seats .  thirdly ,  and most importantly ,  this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept .  we have scandal ,  we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play .  why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background ?  we learn a little about alex ,  but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days ,  a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past .  and alex is the most developed ,  if you can call it that ,  character in the entire film .   as the cliche goes nowadays ,  if you're going to see one movie this year ,  make sure it's not this one .  there's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair .  the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i'm rather fond of .   1 out of 10 .  i'm disappointed .  file this one firmly under -had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing- .  heath my man ,  go back to monster's ball-like cameos .  they really suit you .
-1	my friends and i walked out after 15 minutes ,  and we weren't the first .  afterwards ,  we tried to get our money back .  movie theater management wouldn't allow this ,  but they did agree to let us see another film .  the only time that worked for us was to see dickie roberts :  former child star .  as you can tell ,  this wasn't a memorable night .  probably one of my worst movie nights .  close second has to be when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist .  in conclusion ,  for the sake of humanity ,  please don't see the order .
-1	what was the worst movie of 2003 ?   " cat in the hat ?  "   " gigli ?  "  mais non !  i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year .  badly written ,  badly edited ,  and  ( if i may be so bold )  badly acted ,   " the order "  is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck .  it isn't even accidentally funny ,  like  ( for example )   " showgirls .  "   you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart .  they renamed the movie ,  originally titled  " the sin eaters ,  "  because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was ,  even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie .  instead ,  they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there .   and ,  hey ,  what do you know ,  they were right !  my ex-girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in .  congratulations ,  producers ,  you've met your target market .  she also liked  " grease ii ,  "  so you're in good company .   back on topic ,  heath plays a catholic monk from a specific  ( you guessed it )  order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor .  he has celibacy issues ,  possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion ,  much less be a celibate monk .  the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy .  as much as i've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen ,  his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python ,  thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny .  you know the sort of people i'm talking about .   if i utter any more ,  i would be in danger of generating spoilers .  frankly ,  the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created .
-1	i shouldn't even review this movie ,  since it's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of dr .  cheese's attention .  at least ,  it's not horror in the usual sense .  it's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap .  that's why i turned it off after the first four hours .  imagine my surprise ,  then ,  when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed .  yep ,  that's right ;  in plain terms ,  this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g .    " the order "  had lots of flaws ,  not all of them unique .  in particular ,  it seems to me the main problem with the  " religious "  subgenre of horror films is hollywood's unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms .  it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox .  just ask william peter blatty .  in fact ,  without orthodoxy ,  films like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers'  ( usually dull and illogical )  imaginations .   think about it .  if someone made a movie ostensibly about ,  say ,  physics ,  but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong ,  but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals ,  you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot .  the same goes for these sorts of movies .   in other words ,   " the order "  ( and many similar movies before it )  invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions .  unsurprisingly ,  the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid .  this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing .   avoid this steaming pile .
-1	the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide .  there was no real suspense .  most of the characters were insipid .  the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest .  interest is misleading .  the girl that they chose to provide the film's sensuality might be better .  the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving .  this film is entirely devoid of positives .  it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway .
-1	the good fellas at webster's dictionary define logophobia as the fear of words' .  i may just be logophobic .  for no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film ,  credits contain the words `produced ,  written and directed by : ' ,  and are followed by a single individual's name .  think about it .  there are carpenters ,  electricians and plumbers ,  but so few jack-of-all-trades .  even the most seasoned of directors like speilberg and scorsese rarely take such control of their films .  but there i was ,  all nestled in my theatre seat ,  popcorn in hand and about to watch the order when hurled at me like a nolan ryan fastball ,  were the words `produced ,  written and directed by brian helgeland' .  whoa !    being a film buff ,  i knew of brian helgeland .  as a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company's stock price in 1998 .  there were as many theatrical unpleasantries  ( assassins ,  the postman ,  conspiracy theory )  as there were critical and award winning successes  ( l . a .  confidential ,  mystic river )  .  they seemed to alternate  one good ,  one bad ,  so knowing that his last film ,  bloodwork was one of the most wasted efforts in clint eastwood's career ,  i took a breath and hoped for the best .  in retrospect ,  i should not have exhaled .    the order stars heath ledger  ( helgeland's a knights tale )  ,  as alex bernier ,  a priest in an order known as the carolingians ,  who is summoned to rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the arch bishop deems curious' .  meeting up with father thomas  ( also of the order and played wonderfully by still standings' mark addy )  ,  they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest's untimely death .   complicating matters is a sub plot involving mara sinclair  ( played by shannyn sossamon )  who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill alex during an exorcism .  alex has feelings towards mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience ,  they travel to rome together .   nary a good nights sleep goes by and alex is confronted by william eden  ( benno fürmann )  who claims to be a centuries old sin eater .  a sin eater ,  as we are told ,  are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not ,  thus allowing entrance into heaven .  william ,  as luck would have it ,  is tired of a life of healing and looks for alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties .  alex is reluctant ,  but after the death of his new love mara ,  alex resorts to the ritual of the sin eater to save her and the transformation is complete .  alex then searches for answers to his many queries while father thomas unveils the vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator .    the order is not a terrible film ,  but it is terribly boring .  there were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters .  even in the most dramatic scene - that of alex walking in on the dying mara - is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple's plight .  everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film .   so ,  mr .  helgeland ,  i plead with you not to try this again .  share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self-serving .  until then ,  there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade .  two stars .
-1	horrible waste of time - bad acting ,  plot ,  directing .  this is the most boring movie ever !  there are bad movies that are fun  ( freddy vs .  jason )  ,  and there are bad movies that are horrible .  this one fits into the latter .  bottom line - don't waste your time .
-1	i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go .  this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next .   the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named reve ,  who has visions of his in-pending danger .  he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club ,  and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is .  to put it plainer ,  reve likes the dutch sausage .  so reve concocts a plan to seduce christine's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him .  but its later discovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands ,  who she all murdered .  now reve and christine's boyfriend could be  " the 4th man .  "  the storyline makes sense with no plot holes .  the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine .  the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts .  basically ,  this isn't my cup of tea .   the movie opens with reve getting out of bed in just a t-shirt .  so in the very beginning ,  you get to see reve's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state .  later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors ,  and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues .  reve fondles a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum .  plus there's a lot of blood .  more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined .   not that i have anything against  " shocking "  scenes ,  but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking .  the whole movie is revolved around the shock value .   so if any of this is your cup of tea ,  watch this movie .  otherwise ,  stay far far far far far away from this one .  my mind is still scarred .
-1	in the bygone days of the catholic church ,  a sin-eater was an individual that ,  through ritual ,  would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves .  often ,  these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve ,  thereby denying them entrance into heaven .  the sin-eaters were seen as blasphemous ,  circumventing the chruch's monopoly on redemption .  sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo ,  let the concept wander where it may ,  and you have  " the order "  ,  a movie that combines  " stigmata " 's religious anti-authoritarianism ,   " the x-files " ' paranormal investigation ,  and  " the thorn birds " ' sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works .   alex  ( heath ledger )  is a rogue priest ,  one of the last members of the order of the carolingians ,  a semi-heretical order of knowledge-seeking ,  demon-fighting priests .  when alex's mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances ,  bishop driscoll  ( peter weller )  sends alex to investigate .  tagging along are fellow carolingian thomas  ( mark addy )  and mara  ( shannyn sossman )  ,  who was subject to one of alex's exorcisms a year prior .  the three go to rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre catholic heresy ,  ominous prophecies ,  demonic intrusions ,  and a man claiming to be the last surviving sin-eater  ( benno furmann )  .   written and directed by brian helgeland  ( who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half-hearted  " a knight's tale "  )  ,  the film is an odd one ,  and difficult to classify .  it wants to be several things at once -- supernatural thriller ,  religious intrigue ,  dramatic television pilot -- and only sometimes succeeds at any of them .  this isn't helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance .  ledger ,  in particular ,  has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance .  sossman ,  however ,  displayed the same disconnected performance that she's given in all of her films  ( most notably in  " the rules of attraction "  )  .   the plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs ,  leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings .  large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times ,  which can be confusing for many ,  but this is also one of the film's saving graces .  the structure of the film -- coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film -- forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything  ( the exception to this is historical background on the carolingians and the practice of sin-eating ,  both of which are explained in dry exposition )  .  even at the beginning of the film ,  character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained .  combine this with the on-location shooting and judicious use of special effects ,  and you have a very old-world supernatural thriller ,  with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70's/early 80's .   a brief mention here ,  as well ,  for the subtle and organic score by david torn ,  a combination of minimalist orchestration and lisa gerrard-style exotic vocals .  a very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity .   a confusing plot ,  a lack of purpose ,  and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie ,  but for some reason ,   " the order "  remains watchable .  many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities ,  and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it .  still ,  the film's sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the dvd ,  which i'm sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes .  a recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch .  6 out of 10 .
-1	the screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the  " exorcist' .  but put in some blah-blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged .  there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film .  it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about .  extremely boring ,  i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever .  nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about .   they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me  ( as it intended ,  i hate cgi )  just ruined the movie even more .  some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how  " thought-provoking "  and  " slow-paced-without-action-because it's an intelligent film "  it was .  what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion ?  seems like an uninspired concept .  oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the  " sin-eater "   ( movie was originally going to be titled  " sin-eater "  )  .  lame concept but the movie took the  " sin-eater "  thing too seriously ,  making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was .  yeah ,  i know there were really sin-eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy .   nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie .  if you want horror films that actually have depth ,  watch rosemary's baby ,  the tenant ,  naked blood ,  society ,  cannibal holocaust ,  pin ,  exorcist ,  omen ,  or any of the romero  " dead trilogy "  films .  nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people ,  mainstream movie fans think that though  ( same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece )  .  if you want mind-numbingly boring horror ,  watch the order .  this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride .
-1	:  : potential spoilers :  :   man ,  this movie was awful .  a catholic/superstitious/suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies .   the doubting priest .  sex and the priesthood .  politics and religion .  church hypocrisy .  conspiracy involving the church .  the dawn of a new evil age .  all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil .   pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice .  the story revolves around two concepts :  absolution ,  better known as the sacrament of anointing the sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one's sins while on the brink of death ;  and excommunication ,  the act of cutting a person off from the church .  basically ,  an excommunicated person can't receive absolution .  thus comes in the sin eater ,  and i'll leave it at that .  throw in all the dopy things i already listed and you have  " the order "  .   i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholics .  it also ends with heath ledger saying  ( i paraphrase )   " i am the redeemer and damner of sins ,  i live on without love blah blah blah "  /cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla  " the matrix "  .   i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process .  if you want to see something better i suggest  " the prophecy "  with christopher walken .
-1	yeah ,  well ,  i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little ,  yet very long ,  movie .  apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life .  here's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets . ' we have this jerk ,  so messed up ,  so wandering ,  so selfish ,  aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up-and-coming son ,  jaemin ,  unless it was just that :  physical attraction .  he claims otherwise ,  that it's love .  but after watching this ,  it's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard .   ( alright ,  he's not that bad ,  but still no real redeemable characteristics .  )  i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin .  it was never shown ,  just told ,  that jaemin loves sumin .  perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head :  crazy/stalking = mad love over in seoul .  it has to be ,  because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy .  i was waiting for a tiger named  " baby "  to make an appearance .  okay ,  so sumin works two jobs while going to school ,  so far so good on someone trying to better themselves .  but after his first taste of his stalker's attraction ,  he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring .  what ?  ok ,  well ,  as previously mentioned ,  the obsession doesn't stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup .  basic movie ,  not 100% terrible ,  but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies .
-1	no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am .   i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash ,  since i also see he had made the three/four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well .   not so royal flash .   i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time ,  and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel  ( i still am ,  but he was never really given a chance after that )  .   what a disappointment  ( i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse )  .   none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen .  the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do .  the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic .   looking back with more mature eyes ,  the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda .   if you have read the book and not seen the film ,  i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented :  russian roulette .   a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about .   my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently ,  but i am glad i have not .   if by any chance fraser ever reads this ,  i can only say i think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation ,  but ,  based on my appreciation of that corpus of work ,  it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film ,  as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films .
-1	as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser ,  i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released .  sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again ,  but it was no better the second time .  mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer ,  but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester .  the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here .  to me ,  the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong .  the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts ,  but they are adventure novels .  there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all ,  he is involved in dangerous situations .  this is conveyed in the novels ,  but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style .  it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book .  when i first read that the book was to be filmed ,  the article said that the film was to star oliver reed .  i rejoiced ,  as reed to me was the epitome of flashman .  how i would have loved to see him in the role .  malcolm mcdowell is a good actor ,  but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books  ( too scrawny looking !  flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow )  .  neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck .  what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy .  the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet  ( tom bell )  .  a great shame ,  as the production values ,  costumes ,  sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell .  possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is ,  as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom' ,  adapted by mr fraser ,  worked quite well .  perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen .
-1	raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend  ( dick foran )  thanks to his affection for his friend's wife  ( angela lansbury )  .  this was a full year before he started doing perry mason ,  so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting .   there isn't all that much else here that's interesting though .  lansbury is always good ,  but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious .  there's an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who's also in love with the  " femme fatale "  ,  but the burr character is pretty straightforward .  it's frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury ,  and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i've seen him in .  there's no mystery at all really ,  and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr's character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself  ( double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder ,  presumably )  .  he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room i guess .   a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv .
-1	this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes .  it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers .  in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow ;  the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight .   alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices  ( with little acting ability )  and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along .   this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers .  with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation .
-1	i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest ,  and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make .  and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it .  as far as i'm concerned ,  landon was one of the worst actors on earth ,  and his artistic license went way over the top ,  similar to his massacre of the  " little house "  book series is proof .  the acting ,  for lack of a better word ,  is atrocious ,  the screenplay sloppy ,  and there are more close-ups of landon's puss than should be allowed .   this movie reflects everingham's story as much as  " little house on the prairie "  reflects the books is was  " based "  on .  it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair .
-1	there is so much that is wrong with this film ,  but to sum it up :  terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose .  poor script - they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story .  ridiculously bad ending- in some cases the ending manages to save the film-not in this case .  if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for .  this is the worst film i have seen in a long time .  it was complete torture sitting through this film ,  i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance .  so do yourself a favor .  watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do .  even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture .
-1	the premise of this movie was decent enough ,  but with sub par acting ,  it was just bland and dull .   spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death ,  it was accidental ,  so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it .  also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree .  there is no emotion in this film .  the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister ,  and hearing her message .  it was dull and boring .   with some polishing ,  and better acting it could have been pretty good .
-1	ok  .  .  . i watch a lot of bad movies .  i pride myself on that fact .  many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs .  but this movie is one of the worst i have watched .  i like a good horror movie .  .  . but one with a plot of and sense of movement .  the opening scenes seemed pretty good .  decent music and imagery .  then it goes down hill from there .  one of the main characters has a disability  ( ringing in the ears called tinnitus )  .  now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret .  they made that too much of a focus of the movie .  so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been .  no need to keep bringing it up .  so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table .  so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body .  now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her .  well after seeing her sister over and over again  ( as a zombie like ghost )  and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her .  now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her .  bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan .  only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped .  the idiot didn't even believe he killed her .  so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun .  .  .  . somehow she manages to get herself strangled .  so the last scenes of the movie are of the  " spirits "  of her and her twin walking out of the water .  so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins .  and not one but two innocent people die .   good things about the movie :  imagery   bad things about the movie :  music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
-1	i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago .  first ,  i'm going to say that it looks great .  cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer .  i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks .  i would not call this a horror movie .  putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie .  there's no mystery ,  there's no suspense ,  you know who did it the entire time .    it's a drama .  you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie .  the acting was okay ,  i guess ,  but nothing special .   and the tagline ,   " revenge can be deadly "  .  .  .  . really ?  .  .  . they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact same tagline ?   it pains me to say some of this ,  but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie ,  and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass ,  so i give my honest opinion .
-1	within the first few minutes of this dutch thriller ,  we learn that krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear ,  fantasizes about murdering his roommate ,  tries to steal a magazine from a news stand ,  and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station .  and he's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up  ( except for krabbe in at least one scene too many )  but has nowhere to go .  the basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion .  verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations ,  overt symbolism ,  and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas .
-1	okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60 , 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed ?  plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her ?  and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her  " proof "  .  i don't know i was not happy with the ending .  this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad !  do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy .
-1	just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home .  she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why .   this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite .  i can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better ,  or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size .  i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong .
-1	so the wife and i just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off .  for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie ,  there was just very little excitement .  the acting was atrocious ,  to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes  ( the church lady for example )  .  the dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin ,  although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring .  rather then get the police involved -- which i'm sure those earplugs she found would have dna all over them -- she instead devises a horrible plan to 'get' the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister .  i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too ,  which the movie then fades to black .  bad dialog ,  bad acting ,  bad ending .
-1	this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on .  the dialog is flat ,  filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time .  the choppy ,  shaky ,  film style is a cheap imitation of the  " the ring "  style visual effects .  the characters do not even act like a normal person would .  for example ,  the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door ,  creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home .  what ?  you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her .  way too many flashbacks to her childhood .  too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director .  it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street ,  up the driveway ,  around this corner ,  over here ,  over there ,  oh a side view ,  now a front view .  enough already .  you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris !  terrible movie .  0 out of 100 .  i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it .
-1	this was a movie about infidelity and revenge .  a twin with the  " twin "  connection senses that something is wrong with her sister .  this movie took forever to establish the plot .  a plot that has been done many times .  the acting was lousy for the most part .  once the plot comes together ,  the movie ends .  laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father .  the father seems to favor ashley ,  so laura gets the blame for everything .  there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart ,  but as they grow up ,  their lives go in different directions .  ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry ,  a married man .  of course no good can come of this .  the fact that barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down .  i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere ,  but it never happened .
-1	this film is just plain horrible .  john ritter doing pratt falls ,  75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards ,  poor editing ,  horrible sound mixing  ( dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise )  ,  and a plot that really goes nowhere .  i didn't think i'd ever say this ,  but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film .  there are at least 3 others that suck more .  patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein .  i started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside .  even bogdanovich's kids are awful  ( the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card )  .  this movie is seriously horrible .  there's a reason bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later .  please don't watch it .  if you see it in your television listings ,  cancel your cable .  if a friend suggests it to you ,  reconsider your friendship .  if your spouse wants to watch it ,  you're better off finding another soulmate .  i'd rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again .  if i could sum this film up in one word ,  that word would be :  suckotrocity
-1	for a film with so much promise it was disappointing ,  thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable . the plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clichéd ending i've seen in a movie for some time .  the final scene would have ripped my heart out ,  if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with .  i was numb !  from the very first scene - one was left wondering ,  if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help ,  or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date .  it was a horror in the true sense of the word .
-1	lolita is a rebel and she's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories ,  between sci-fi and fantasy .  .  .  well ,  this surrender cinema production is not very good :  very bad acting ,  horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line .  but ,  the sex scenes are pretty well done ,  lot of lesbian scenes ,  and jacqueline lovell ,  as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax ,  offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show .  for lovell's fans only .
-1	the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen ,  the characters are totally unconvincing .  this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting ,  which the plot to  " the prodigy "  was not .  it's sort of a bad mix between  " fresh "  and  " animal house "  ,  except that both of those movies were good .
-1	cybil richards directs another full moon/surrender cinema masterpiece of erotica .  this time jacqualine lovell  ( dressed in rather fetching silver outfit )  is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity .  however she can't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them .  the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack  ( at least for this sort of film )  .  the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too .  jacqueline lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below .  she also fits in a little lesbian activity .  to be honest lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare .  here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the 'drama' .  utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features .  mediocre even for surrender's output and clearly a new budget low for them also .
-1	i watched the movie ,  and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience .  the language would put to shame the street loafers .   the plot ;  a father forcing none of his son to marry ,  seems far-fetched .    the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded's attention .    .  .  . and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh ,  and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look .   hope it saves your time !
-1	.  .  . and even then ,  even they can live without seeing it .  to be honest ,  this film  ( if one deigns to call it that )  is of real interest only to bondage freaks .  bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new  ( and i do mean *nothing* )  ,  nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar ,  loved ,  or cherished .   nevermind the abysmal screenplay ,  the wooden ,  less-than-community-theater acting ,  the utter absence of direction ,  the crappy lighting ,  or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values .  this is definitely  " hey ,  kids ,  let's make a movie !  "  movie-making of the lowest order .  i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera .  no ,  i'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright *wrong* .   it's wrong because the young lady playing bettie page ,  a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the queen of curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs ,  utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged .  this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess ,  but not for the wretched excess itself ,  which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re-enacted b&d set-pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux-biographical scenes delineating ms .  page's fall from grace  ( so to speak )  .  there's actually probably more information ,  per se ,  about page's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie .   do not be fooled .  this is not a worthy companion film to  " the notorious bettie page .  "  this is not a worthy film at all .  this is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time ,  and does it without class ,  without style ,  and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever .  no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment ,  i guarantee that .   avoid at all costs .  if free ,  remember that time is money ,  too .  yours may not be worth much ,  but i'm betting it's worth enough that you'll be sorry you wasted time with this one .  that's it ,  i'm done ,  you've been warned .
-1	this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty page's ( paige richards )  career .  the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history .  her most memorable work came in the 1950's and was fetish photos ,  bondage and cat-fight  " girly flicks "  .  irving klaw ( dukey flyswatter ) at his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera .  there was no nudity in the famous photos or  " stag films "  ,  but nonetheless ,  klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution .  it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career .  the girl-next-door with jet black hair ,  blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades .  after all ,  it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world ,  elvis presley .  betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion .  this movie actually could have been a lot better ;  but good enough to hold interest .   miss richards is stunning in her own right .  bra ,  panties ,  garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least .  also in the cast :  jaimie henkin ,  jana strain ,  emily marilyn and julie simone .  be advised this movie can change your heart rate .
-1	i'm kinda torn on dark angel .  the film appears to be a  " loving "  tribute to the greatest pin-up to ever live - but there is so little actual  " content "  that the film itself is virtually pointless .  i can't really see what the motivation or  " point "  of this film is - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either .  .  .   the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling .  almost the entire film is comprised of  " re-enactments "  of some of bettie's more  " famous "  photo-shoots and loops .  these re-enactments take up literally 75% of the films run-time ,  and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person .  the film touches briefly on her short-lived legitimate acting pursuits ,  and her subsequent decision to leave the  " business "  and become religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed-over in favor of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scenes .  .  .   dark angel isn't a horrible film - there's just no substance to it .  the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots - up-close it's a no-go .  the other thing that irritated me ,  is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits .  the film itself is obviously extremely low-budget ,  but does what it can set and costume-wise within it's limitations - so no gripes from me there .  the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved .  in fact - the most memorable thing about the whole film for me ,  was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter .  no joke - check the cast list .  can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her .  and if you are that bad off - then you need to seek treatment anyway .  .  . 4/10
-1	this movie was bad beyond belief .  i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival .  before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before ,  which happened to be its  " world premiere .  "  i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point .  we all understood by the end .    its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one .  dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige ,  in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies .  the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least .  a scene would start going then someone would say  " wow you're so great bettie ,  why don't we make another movie .  "  this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as  ( and even more boring than )  the normal part of the movie .  by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up .  it was that ludicrous .  i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre ,  but people were not laughing with the movie maker ,  they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure .  this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory .    i know movies are expensive .  i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen .  the movie looks like it was made for $12 .  the cuts ,  the graininess ,  and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience .  this movie makes  " dude ,  where's my car ?  "  look like citizen kane .    my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured .  the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good .  apparently ,  the previous night ,  the night of the  " world premiere "  the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie .  bettie paige's movies were destroyed .  they should destroy this movie too .
-1	the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script .  it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie's story and re-creations of the klaw short films .  while the klaw re-creations are well done ,  it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety .  page richards ,  while not an amazing actress ,  does a decent job overall .  and ,  at times ,  she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie .  also of note is some faithful attention to detail .  costumes and clothing well done ,  as is some of the set direction .  the sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y ,  but do feel of the era .  it is sometimes surprisingly well lit ,  and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant ,  retro feel .
-1	they made me watch this in school and it was terrible .  the movie is outdated .  the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting . the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience . i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors ,  but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life . this accounts for cheesy acting very often .  also ,  very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched .  i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them .  though ,  it was written to be educational ,  funny ,  suspenseful ,  and hip ,  it ended up being boring ,  dry ,  far-fetched ,  and old .  i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it .
-1	in sixth grade ,  every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester .  every class had something to do with this terrible show .  we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters .  in math we talked about charts and other sea crap .  in science we talked about whales  ( which was actually somewhat interesting ,  so this wasn't a 100% waste of time )  .  all day everyday was torture .  not only that ,  but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well .  i could see if this was a new series or something ,  but it was ,  like ,  '93 .  i'm still trying to block this out .
-1	i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one .  but this film is static .  never mind the production value ,  which is very noble for its budget ,  but the pacing is deadly .  admittedly these folks achieve much with little ,  but the film fails on the most fundamental level .  it's boring .  the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls .  it should have been 65 minutes .  the best thing about the dr .  jekyll is mr .  hyde who isn't seen nearly enough .  he had the most dramatic potential .  instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean-brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition .  it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video .   noble efforts by everyone in the production ,  but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice .  instead it's just a lame retread .
-1	i didn't know it was possible to release a movie this bad .  the labeling sounded so promising ,  but you would think that with a cast of 20 ,  at least one of them would be able to act .  my wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes .  she made a wise decision .
-1	it is so sad .  even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake ,  there's nothing out there &  .  the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard .  i like the brother and sister in this movie .  they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like  " my friends are going to be so jealous !  "  hey ,  whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning ?  thats retarded !  i practically ignored the second half of this .  my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe .  the same exact sound for every chop !
-1	as far as i can tell you ,  in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors ,  this film is currently available on dvd .  i found it only a few weeks ago .   it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it .  i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks .  now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had ?  ?  ?  i thought so .   this film was indeed well worth 98 cents .  99 cents ,  i might start to argue with you .  but clearly worth 98 cents .  and remember that saying about getting what you pay for .  for slasher film mavens only .
-1	this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th .  the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp .  he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father ,  and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother  ( another f13th take off )  .  the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims .  then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods ,  soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son .  later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute .  he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on .   this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers .
-1	one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams ,  rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins .  one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s .  this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside ,  causing the material to wash downhill ,  where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment .  the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries .  the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas .  some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields ,  where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult .  thus ,  the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner .   first ,  we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor ,  a very rare treatment in 1938 .  a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time .  the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors ,  with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations .  then ,  we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero ,  to be paired with olivia de havilland .  among other things ,  this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it .  even the usually colorful gabby hayes ,  in his small role ,  seemed unusually subdued .  unfortunately ,  i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film .  the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems .  it needed to be more like  " the good earth "  ,  released just the year before .  just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man ,  such as errol flynn .  finally ,  there is the matter of the inane title .  surely ,  warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title .   " gold or grain "  is short and to the point .  incidentally ,  i understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills' ,  waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining .
-1	as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie .  but ,  what a disappointment !  although the acting and the production values aren't bad ,  the script is awful ,  the plot is unrealistic ,  and the theme is disturbing .   the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children .  i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women .  has the writer been living under a rock ?    although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen ,  i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone .  it's terrible .  it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after .
-1	i went to see this film with low expectations ,  but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film .  sadly ,  that's about all i got .  the story covers familiar territory  ( the high school reunion )  ,  but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme .  though the quality of the acting was good overall ,  the content of the film was appalling .  the sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married ,  procreating or both  ( though this was couched as a post-feminist choice  )  .  worse still was the racism--the shrill jewish mother ,  the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty  ( tormenting the class geek )  .  we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo ,  and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen .
-1	by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing .  you know the type .  .  .  . funny but supposed to frighten you .  .  .  .  this was not funny or horrific .  the writing was lame .  .  . the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness .  .  .  . they were so expected .  the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script .  .  . at least i hope that wasn't their best .  . watch this movie at your own risk .  .  .  .  .  . i give it negative 3 stars outta 10
-1	pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain !  the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties .  this is a horrible film in every way .  imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video .  they would receive a d for this .  college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school .  since this monstrosity was made by  " professionals "  i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation .  i enjoy watching bad movies like  " plan 9 from outer space "  but ,  this thing doesn't even fall into that category .  the script ,  acting ,  sound ,  and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable .  if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood ,  blaxploitation ,  or 1970's horror films .  after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life .
-1	unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from kerry conran ,  for whom this is clearly a labour of love .  unfortunately it's just not that good .  it all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score ,  a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg .  the movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels ,  serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still ,  superman ,  metropolis ,  planet of the apes ,  the iron giant ,  star wars and the spy who loved me .  the film however ,  fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons :  the main being that it's such a labour of love ,  so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world ,  conran actually forgets about making a movie .  there is little to no tension ,  atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles ,  dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces .  even the noir elements fall flat .  this is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards .  the actors don't get to do much either - jude law is wooden ,  gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid ,  angelina jolie is wasted - and it's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything .  it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday .  nice ending though .
-1	if you are looking for eye candy ,  you may enjoy sky captain .  sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers .  the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie .  now ,  saying that ,  the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain .   after ten minutes ,  i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time .  i was hoping this movie would get better ,  but it never achieved any degree of interest .  after thirty minutes ,  the urge to walk out kept growing and growing .  now ,  i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number .  yet ,  this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life .   acting---there is none .  the three main performers are pitiful .  jude law  ( also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on )  is just awful in the title role .  i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again .   paltrow tries so hard to be campy ,  that it backfires in her face .  the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting .  after this performance ,  i would applaud that decision .   story---soap operas are better written .  the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses .   directing---none .  everything was put into the special effects that story ,  acting and directing suffer greatly .  even  " the phantom menace "  had better acting and that is not saying a great deal .   i would have to give this movie a  " 0 "  out of  " 10 "  .  avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release .
-1	the opening shot was the best thing about this movie ,  because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate ,  well-crafted independent film .  damn that opening shot for filling me hope .  as the  " film "  progressed in a slow ,  plodding manner ,  my thoughts were varied in relation to this  " film "  :  was there too much butter in my popcorn ?  did the actors have to pay the director to be in this  " film "  ?  did i get my ticket validated at the box office ?  yes ,  dear reader .  i saw this film in the theatre !  this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre ,  because at home you can turn it off .  were there any redeeming values ?  peter lemongelli as the standard college  " nerd "  had his moments ,  especially in a dog collar .  other than that this  " film "  went from trying to be a comedy ,  to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter .  it succeeded on none of these fronts .  oh ,  and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad .  her performance was the only comedy i found .
-1	i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out .  it was pretty horrible .  in the process of trying too hard ,  they over acted and made a horrible movie .  i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark--but ,  i was wrong .  i was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie .  i was lured in by the free aspect of the preview ,  but it turned out to be a waste of my time--and ,  usually ,  i'm very easily amused .  it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ,  ideas and filming ,  but because they threw together so many ideas at once ,  it failed .  i'm not usually picky about movies and i usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies ,  but i had to warn everyone not to watch it .  i registered on imdb just to tell all of you guys
-1	in short ,  this movie is completely worthless .   the idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future .  an interesting idea ,  but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief ,  so the idea just flops .   apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed .  but as a graphics person ,  the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening .  the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality .  and i don't understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking .  if anything ,  the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics -- they don't measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics .  the models for the robots were so simple ,  plain and very uncompelling .  there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric-like animals on that island ,  but they are not explained in any way .   the story is horrible beyond belief .  in fact i can't believe i didn't just walk out of this movie .  the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated ,  and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception .  why is the morris paley character even there ?  we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic -- i mean he flies a plane ,  and saved one person  ( polly )  for personal reasons .  yeah there's a great hero for you .  dex has very little screen time ,  so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him ?  who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault ,  and why would they do it  ( remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was robotic )  ?   plot holes :   ( 1 )  why did bai ling's character  ( a major fall from her excellent character in  " the crow "  )  halt the robots who had captured joe ?  they were looking for the vials ,  and had not found them .   ( 2 )  why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed  ( he doesn't have or know about the vials ,  and the bad guys didn't know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex )  ?   ( 3 )  polly indicates that  " they "  don't know anything about totenkopf ,  yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi-style file on him .   ( 4 )  the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese -- if they know all about this mysterious area ,  then why the hell is their map blank in that spot ?   ( 5 )  at one point ,  polly and joe have to give up their clothes  ( they are burned )  -- joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes ,  yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress ,  then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes back .   *sigh* .  how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap ?   we are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music ,  even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen .   and the acting ?  we're supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents ?  which character isn't annoying ?  i think ling bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie  ( she doesn't have a single line )  .  the dialogue wasn't camp ,  and doesn't even rise to the level of cheese .  its just bad and annoying .  these people aren't hero's or compelling ;  they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life .   i can't believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb .  imho it should be competing with  " batman forever "  in the bottom 100 of all time .
-1	when robot hordes start attacking major cities ,  who will stop the madman behind the attacks ?  sky captain !  !  !  jude law plays joe sullivan ,  the ace of the skyways ,  tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex-girlfriend polly perkins  ( gwyneth paltrow )  and former flight partner ,  captain franky cook  ( angelina jolie )  .   sky captain and the world of tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming .  the film's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie .  the visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that .  however ,  there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals .  the film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary .  i blame director and writer kerry conran .  he focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story .  the movie is like a girl with no personality ,  after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring .  sky captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality .  it's simply just another case of style over substance .   the acting is surprisingly average and that's not really their fault since they had very little to work with .  the main reason i watched this movie is because of angelina jolie .  however ,  the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes .  her performance is surprisingly bland as well .  jude law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him .  gwyneth paltrow was just average ,  nothing special at all .  ling bai's performance was the only one i really liked .  she gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film .   the movie is not a complete bust though .  there were some  " wow "  and exciting scenes .  there just weren't enough of them .  the film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable .  it was actually quite bland and it wasn't very engaging at all .  it's too bad the film wasn't very good since it had such a promising premise .  in the end ,  sky captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching .  rating 4/10
-1	i entered the theater to sky captain in 2004 expecting a good film .  nearly every review of this movie had been positive ,  the effects looked enticing ,  the previews convincing .   needless to say ,  disappointment actually doesn't describe the feeling i got from this film .  it was rage .   beyond being boring and poorly written ,  the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source .  i understand the difference between an homage and stealing :  this was stealing .  more importantly ,  it seems that the filmmakers didn't steal to progress a point or move the plot along .  they stole just to show that they could .  there is literally no point to showing a clip of the wizard of oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene  ( that i won't elaborate on )  which steals from the same film .  needless to say ,  every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept :  it was literally just a rehash of something i had already seen ,  from pulp-era robots reminiscent of the old superman cartoons and the recent film  " the iron giant "  ,  to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films ,  most recognizable in recent years as darth maul in  " star wars :  the phantom menace "  .   on the subject of the actual film ,  most of the performances were completely wooden .  perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue-screen ,  with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors .  frankly ,  this is no excuse for poor acting .  if a person was ever a child ,  they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying .   finally ,  there is no humanity in this film .  the protagonists are the only real human beings here .  nearly all the antagonists are robots ,  and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand .  if robots are attacking the entire planet ,  shouldn't we expect to see masses of humanity running from them ?  the sub-par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to ,  really ,  anything here .   the film wasn't the worst movie out there ,  which is why i didn't give it a 1 .  rather ,  the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films :  the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects ,  but without artistic vision or originality of any kind ,  it falls flat .
-1	the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon 'sky captain' jude law's base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is .  first off ,  let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film .  a cult hit it might become ,  but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve .  i can see the studio pitch now .   " let's combine 1920's german expressionism and a 1940's globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene !  wow ,  won't that be a success !   "  skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess .  there are too many fake explosions ,  too many unconvincing dogfight scenes ,  and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two-dimensional .  after all ,  why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three ,  or five ,  or one hundred ?  !  moreover ,  what could have been a groundbreaking film ,  seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting ,  will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi .  quite simply ,  the graphics are amazingly poor .  from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights ,  everything seems to be just a little off .  i'm not being nit-picky here in any way .  an infant could notice that a car doesn't glide along the road like a maglev train  ( unless its a mercedes s500 )  .  and for those of you raising your voices in protest ,  crying out 'this is a stylized film ,  it's not supposed to be like reality' ,  let me just say this .  lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating real-life actors with cgi ,  starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films ,  the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920's back into the hollywood film portfolio ,  and tim burton's batman created a unique picture of new york city/gotham that has yet to be repeated .  sky captain falls so short of all these films ,  it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence .  plus ,  the acting is so poor ,  it makes me positively ill .  so there you have it .  i spent $9 to see this film and you get my review .  i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did .
-1	this movie was way over-hyped .  a lot of the viewers ,  who thought this was  " amazing "  must have been into the old school movies ,  cause the whole movie is set in the past .  at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past ,  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass ,  but it just going .  basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past ,  and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie ,  even with special effects .  you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with .  there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did ,  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying  " it's the greatest movie ever done "  .  it's just crap on a stick .  it also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy .  i don't understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced ,  and i also don't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this .  it's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print .  .  .  " it will all be done on a computer "  .  this was a movie that should have been on a movie network ,  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary .  i'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this .  whatever you do ,  don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow .
-1	a gave it a  " 2 "  instead of a  " 1 "   ( awful )  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning ,  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork .  but that wasn't enough to save it .   the  " sepia "  toned ,  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies .  nothing new there .  i can see there were some hat-tips to other old ,  classic movies .  ok .  no problem with that .   but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting ,  not something that would put you to sleep .   the story line and the script of this movie was awful ,  the characters two dimensional .  slow moving .  some of the scenes were pretty to look at ,  but ultimately ,  as a whole ,  it was quite boring ,  i couldn't recommend it .
-1	visually stunning ?  most definitely .  i have seen few films look this good in some time .  sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography ,  computer graphics ,  and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh .  the time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s .  the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason .  also ,  mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide .  who can stop them and save the world ?  alright ,  it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead ,  and in the wings his trusty ,  thoroughly competent sidekick .  what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization .  the plot for this film is ridiculous .  that being said ,  the film is going for a serial-like feeling of film serials of yesteryear .  they had pretty far out stories and bad acting - but none of them ,  and i mean none of them ,  had the budget and big names this film had .  two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film afloat ,  one would think ,  but sky captain sinks miserably .  despite its fantastic dark look ,  i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life .  i had little interest in a story that generated little interest .  i didn't care at all for any of the glib portrayals .  paltrow was just awful .  jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance .  law cannot carry the one-liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders .  i mean ,  let's face it ,  he's not will smith ,  mel gibson ,  or even wesley snipes .  the sad thing about sky captain ,  at least for me ,  was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little .  i was bored ten minutes into the film - waiting for something to hook my interest - and it never came .
-1	i like the time period ,  i like the attempt ,  but watching a movie that looks like i'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache .  if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus ,  i would upgrade my computer .  could be that this was the look the director was after ,  but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes .  if i hadn't taken someone with me to this film ,  i was out of there .  even though it was a series and not a movie per say ,  band of brothers accomplished this .  they made it look like wwii footage ,  with just a touch of graininess ,  but it was still a pleasure to watch .  movies need real people ,  with real sets ,  and real locations ;  use cgi when it is appropriate ,  not for an entire film .
-1	sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i've seen in a long while .  rife with amazing cg and special effects ,  studded with an a-list cast  ( jude law ,  gwyneth paltrow ,  angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi )  and racing along with an overused but indiana jones-esquire storyline ,  this should have been a great movie to watch .   'should have' being the key term here ,  of course .   jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over-the-shoulder ,  heart-melting smirks ,  but you can't make something out of nothing ,  and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue .   ( if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said ,   " good boy ,  dex ,  "  just one more time ,  i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me .  )  gwyneth paltrow ,  as polly perkins ,  is nothing less than nerve grating .  her nasal whining and not-quite-sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie .  perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book heroine- who knows ?  i expected more from her .  an example of how a similar character was played  ( and played well )  is in the late 90's flick  " the phantom ,  "  starring kristy swanson and billy zane .  rent the movie and you'll know what i mean .   giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film .   ( angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch .  i'll admit it .  )  in just a few short scenes ,  both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry ,  two-dimensional castmates .   the plot and steady story progression were old ,  boring ,  and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years .  the pace is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie ,  and a snail's pace in the second ,  giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film ,  but to figure out who the key villain is as well .  the pairing is rather clichéd ,  also- polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance ,  and their story isn't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched .  when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film ,  nobody's surprised ,  and nobody really cares either .   props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film ,  and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout .  but sky captain ,  despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie ,  falls flat on its face .  not even worth the $2 . 75 i paid to get into the theater .
-1	" sky captain "  may be considered an homage to comic books ,  pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres .  one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences .  i don't think this is at all true .  one's expectations of the films , fiction and serials that  " captain "  pays tribute to were entirely different .  especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children .  this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those .  of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama .  toward the climax of  " captain "  law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal .  they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy .  of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency .   one doesn't expect films like this to necessarily  " make sense "  .  one does expect them to be fun ,  thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic .   " captain "  has almost none .  remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge ?  well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side ?  they can fly !  !  !  the chasm itself means nothing to them .  the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape ?  if the land across the chasm is 'forbidden' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if .   i know that paltrow and law  ( both of whom have given fine performances in the past )  were playing  " types "  but both were pretty flat .  only giovanni ribisi  ( who showed himself capable of great nuance here )  and angelina jolie seemed to give any  " oomph "  to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance .  he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted .   the film had a great 'look' but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts .  cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical ,  when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular .  when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints .  there is no real sense of wonder .  a cgi mountain doesn't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does .  i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn't necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn't it feel that way ?  it just didn't .    as for the weak and clichéd script .  .  . homage is no excuse .  even so ,  had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable .   " the last samurai "  was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that  " captain "  didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that  " sky captain "  most definitely did not .   i'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's .  the original  ( jay garrick )  flash or green lantern  ( alan scott )  come to mind as being ripe for such treatment .  maybe the better ,  more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film .  it would be hard to be worse .
-1	visually interesting ,  but falls flat in the originality department .  this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle .  jude law has the charisma of burnt toast ,  but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen .  in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film ,  and had me thinking about work ,  bills ,  my dogs ,  etc .  there are many moments that scream bluescreen .  paltrow is as wooden as they get .  this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp .  my only complaint on the technique is that black & white film  ( sorry ,  computer )  would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white .  just a big dull cliché mess .  i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again .
-1	i went to school with jeremy earl ,  that is how i heard of this movie ,  i don't really know if it was in the theater's at all .  i don't recall the name .  i have seen it ,  it is like one of those after school specials .  the acting is ok ,  not great .  the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny .  so the only comment i can give this movie is  " eh "  i borrowed the movie from jeremy ,  if i was in a movie rental place ,  this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age .  i've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed ,  the slang is overused or just outdated .  many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable .
-1	" sky captain and the world of tomorrow "   ( an amazingly incovenient title )  is simply a bad movie ;  it has no heart ,  no deep ideas ,  nothing very special about it .  yes ,  the cgi backgrounds look interesting ,  but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus .  additionally ,  the movie uses music the same way as ,  say ,   " gilligan's island "  or the scooby-doo cartoons-- it never stops .  terribly ,  simply terrible .  there are no fresh ideas ,  either ,  just gobs and gobs and gobs and .  .  .  etc .  ,  of bits taken from older movies and serials .  there is no gatekeeper here ,  the movie just seems to exist because it can .  save your money and your time .  not entertaining at all .
-1	in a word ,  this film was boring .  it lacked life and spark .  a big problem is with the two leads .  jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever .  he was boring ,  and she was annoying .    the visuals were interesting ,  but they didn't enhance the scenes .  if anything ,  the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen .  none of the action sequences felt real ,  and hence ,  the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger .   the film had potential ,  but it needed a better script ,  better acting ,  and a better director .  i kept thinking during the film ,  you know ,  this movie would've worked if harrison ford was sky captain ,  karen allen was polly ,  and steven spielberg was the director .    ignore the critical acclaims for this film .  the critics i think are praising the film because they *want* to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels .
-1	what a waste of time !  i've tried to sit through 'sky captain .  .  "  about 6 times ,  and every time ,  within about 3 minutes ,  i start doing something else - anything else !  it's a downright boring movie ,  the acting is terrible ,  the writing dull ,  and obviously a first-time director ,  because it's stiff .  and i wanted to love it .  i love sci-fi ,  the old cliffhangers ,  and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon ,  and metropolis ,  but my god ,  what a waste of money .  i used to work for paramount pictures ,  and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests .  she told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it .  10 years later ,  paramount releases this piece of crap .  sherry was right in 1993 ,  but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog .  blue screen an effect shot ,  but not an entire movie .  let's not forget ,  neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors  ( but easy on the eyes )  .  paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort .  too bad - it could've worked ,  but only under a skilled director .  the funny thing is ,  sky captain's director will keep getting work ,  even after this dreck .  it's commerce ,  not art !
-1	this movie feels so empty .  in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 .  because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird .   the acting was horrible !  it's so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor/actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives .  .  looking at the floor for their marks .  .  .   spoilers :  also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie .  at one point at sky captain's home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip .  they have advanced warning an attack is coming .  .  .  so what do they do ?  nothing .  all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain .  .  .   the entire world is under attack and he's the only person ever fighting back .  at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally .  .  .  but what do they do ?  nothing .  .  .  the movie is over .  .  .
-1	i've said this in other reviews ,  without a story ,  you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want ,  still no one will give a damn .   the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco  ( which i love )  ,  and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making .  however ,  it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie ,  he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film .   ( spoiler )  for crying out loud ,  they forgot to have a villain in this thing !  ok they have one ,  but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place .  conran misses the point of having a villain .  as far as action goes ,  well let's see ,  sky captain  ( law )  shoots down one robot ,  two or three of the flapping wing airplanes  ( before dex  ( ribisi )  tells him to stop shooting them down !  !  !  )  ,  and a couple robots ,  but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him .  paltrow as polly or peggy or punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie  ( the reviewer who comments on hers and law's lack of chemistry is so right )  and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera ,  showing she only has two shots left ,  both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie ,  one uncomically ,  one quite funny ,  although i saw it coming from 70 years away .  no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen ,  and that's the movie's real flaw .  an audience doesn't identify with robots ,  they need a hero to root for ,  and a visible ,  despicable villain to hate .  without that ,  plus a good engaging story ,  all the cg in the world won't help .
-1	i gave 1 to this film .  i can't understand how ettore scola , one of the greater directors of italian cinema ,  made a film like this ,  so stupid and ridiculous !  all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial , boring and not interesting .  too long , too boring .  the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann .  hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film .
-1	this movie should be called  " plan 9 from joseph smith .  "  i think its weirdness is underappreciated .  the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich's  " the population bomb  ( 1968 )  ,  "  and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons .  the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of  " heavenly father's "   ( god's )  plan .  and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad .  get it ?   this version was filmed in 1989 ,  which is confusing .  it's utah ,  so it looks and feels like 1983 ,  the play was actually written in 1973 ,  and of course ,  the theology is part 1840's ,  part battlestar galactica .  some of the action takes place on earth and some in the  " pre-existence ,  an aimless romper-room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries ,  losing their shot at celestial glory .   it is as stagey as they come ,  but don't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all into population control ,   ( presumably )  counseling their parents not to have any more children !  !  having big families was ,  at the time the play was written ,  the cultural norm in the lds community ,  and more importantly ,  considered part of god's plan .  the church has since done a 180 ,  and have made family planning a choice of the parents ,  and large families are much less the cultural norm now .  making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern-day mormon moot !   ahhh but it's really only as good as the music .  there are some catchy tunes here that just won't let this movie die the 1970's death it was pre-destined for .  the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there --wink .  and the tough ,  cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica .  so cheers to all that !  gather the family around ,  make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show !
-1	to start with ,  i have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour .  yeah ,  some things happen ,  but you don't know why or what for .  when you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera ,  dealing with mature prostitutes ,  dead mothers ,  illegitimate sons .  .  .  the characters are rather poor and the actors  ( specially the young ones )  don't help that much to make'em look credible .  only marisa paredes stands out ,  but she's a superb actress ,  no matter if the movie is pure rubbish .   the only positive things to say about  " frío sol de invierno "  is that débutant pablo malo seems to have good intentions ,  and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense .  .  .  well ,  maybe the next time .  .  .   *my rate :  4/10
-1	adrian has just gone out of the asylum ,  being rich and with no parents ,  his life seems empty .  one day ,  he meets gonzalo ,  a poor boy whom mother is prostitute .  desperate for earning some money ,  gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents .  this is a movie from a new director ,  and it is perfectly clear in most of the film :  scenes not correctly directed ,  dialogues a little forced ,  some incoherences in the script .  .  . anyway ,  the ending is unexpectedly well done  ( well ,  just a little )  and that saves a little the film .  actors are known and with great quality ,  nevertheless ,  they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting ;  all of them have done better papers in other film .  the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends .  of course there are lots of worse films ,  but ,  sure ,  there are many many better ones .
-1	for shame ,  for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel .  the movie was not only bad ,  but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality .  the plot ,   ( was there one ?  )  seemed to go no where .  the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances .  i gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off .  a  " 1 "  for awful only because there is nothing lower .  don't waste your time on this one ,  you'll not miss anything .
-1	i rented this thinking it might be interesting ,  and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner .  hard to follow ,  strange editing ,  disjointed storyline ,  the characters mumble ,  all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time .  i just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters - not even ian holm could save this film .  unless you need a cure for insomnia ,  i'd skip it .  3/10 ,  and that's being generous .
-1	i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as  " the worst film i have ever seen "  .   even if you ignore the dodgy accents ,  low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it .  i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film .   the simple answer is - they didn't .  characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative .  even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them .   i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from .  but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened .   they even change the true meaning of the books title  " rancid aluminium "  by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title .   a real mess of a film from start to finish .
-1	there have been some low moments in my life ,  when i have been bewildered and depressed .  sitting through rancid aluminium was one of these .   the warning signs were there .  no premiere  ( even the stars didn't want to attend )  and no reviews in magazines .  the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep .   nothing in the film was explained .  the narration was idiotic .  i cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot ,  then to my growing despair ,  it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot dampening my joy .  i sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity .    there were some positive aspects ,  mainly unintentional moments of humour .  for example ,  the scene in which the main character ,  for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle ,  while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears .   my words cannot explain the anger i feel ,  so i shall conclude thus .   rancid aluminium :  for sadists ,  wastrels ,  and regressives only who want to torture themselves .
-1	well ,  what to say .  .  .   having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was ?  ?  v . dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point .  .  .  i had to look away from the screen ,  i was feeling physically sick .  .  .  round and round and round .  .  .  .  you get the idea .  .  .   very very strange accents at many points .  .  .  .   " those that should know ,  know "   unless your getting in for free ,  or being paid to watch it ,  or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something .  .  then forget it .  .  .
-1	okay .  so there aren't really that many great movies around .  recent gems like american dream ,  the straight story and even toy story 2 don't normally come so close together .  but boy  (  !  )  does this film counter-balance the quality .   i have no idea what these people thought they were doing .  are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of **** ?  i can just see it now .  .  .   producer -  " so we've got joe fiennes .  he's cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love .  and we've got rhys ifans ,  who isn't cute but was cool in notting hill .  we'll mix in a really mediocre score ,  a few forgettable post-britpop tunes ,  hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you've got the worst film of the new millennium . and believe me ,  it's gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years .  "   the bank -  " i like it !  any unnecessary sex ?  bad camera movements ?  and what about the worst accents this side of devil's own ?  "   producer -  " yeah ,  we got plenty of those .  "   the bank -  " sounds great ,  where do we sign ?  "   please .
-1	i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable .  the plot was weak to say the least .  i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up  ( i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs ?  )  .  at least i didn't pay to rent it .  the best part of the film is definitely dani behr ,  but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants .
-1	must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time ,  but this one is up there with the worst of them .  plot troubling to follow .  sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film .   i can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two .  sadly ,  in my case ,  i have the dvd .  it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time .
-1	i have seen bad films but this took the p*** .  made no sense ,  and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds ,  oh and i think one has a low sperm count .  its that good .  a welshman plays a sweary cockney .  a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy ,  and some lesser lights play dim tarts .   and there are some russian gangsters .  oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs .   avoid this film like the plague .
-1	we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie .  a waste of time .  the premise was not too bad .  but one workable idea  ( interaction between real bussinessmen and russian mafia )  is not followed by an intelligent script
-1	.  .  . the first film i had to walk out on .  and it was the cast and crew pre-screening  ( not that i was involved ,  i hasten to add )  .  i made it through the first hour ,  so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment ,  but that was my limit .   like other comments here ,  how did this get through any kind of qa .  an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue ,  the epitome of wooden acting ,  awful casting ,  all wrapped together without a plot .   tara fitzgerald's casting was bizarre ,  almost comic .  she possesses the worst russian accent in movie history .   as i left the screening ,  the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema .  they obviously couldn't sit through it again either .
-1	how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure ?  horrible script ,  annoyingly hectic camera ,  awfully edited ,  gruesomely badly acted .  only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life .  another painful proof that  " different "  sometimes equals  " dreck "  .  why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand ?  do yourself a favour :  spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees .  it's less painful and more fun than this movie !
-1	just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film ,  i decided to write another review .  i missed a few things out last time .  .  .   first ,  the script .  second ,  the acting .  third ,  jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax !  !  !   i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something !   are you getting the picture ?
-1	boring and appallingly acted ( summer pheonix )  .  she sounded more asian than jewish .  some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century .  what on earth fine actors like ian holm & anton lesser were doing in this is beyond me .
-1	this is a truly abysmal `lock stock' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script .  i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk ,  they must have been bribed .  a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after 10 minutes .  not the worst film ive ever seen ,  that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie'  ( i use the term loosely )  `gummo'  ( i feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life )  but this trash is nearly right down there with it .  definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen .  stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films .
-1	i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad .  that has been done in great detail already ,  many times over .  the 'plot' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles .  anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves .  it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled ,  yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen .   i am only making these comments ,  and indeed the only reason i went to see the film ,  is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene .  it was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards rhys ifan's face in the bar in 'russia'  ( it was actually filmed at the former butlins holiday camp at barry island )  .  my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras' agency and this was his first part .  having seen the film ,  it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever .   i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released .  i have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so .  in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd ,  i would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot ,  then jam them into your eye sockets .  this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film .
-1	there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie .  i never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince .  fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian .  when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing .  as the for the major problem .  .  .  . the plot .  .  .  . was there one ?  i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end .  .  . it was ridiculous .  save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie !
-1	this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today .  not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors ,  so what went wrong ?  i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all .  be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish .  but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot .  a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid ,  very stupid plot twists/devices .  i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience .  if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather ,  what about lock ,  stock .  .  .  .  thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film .  .  .  .  .
-1	words really can't describe how bad this film is .  i thought zandalee was bad ,  but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off .  this is just laughable !  terrible script ,  poor direction ,  awful acting and you know what ?  i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long .  if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment ,  book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money  ( assuming that you need it !  )  .  incidentally ,  i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie .  it is terrible !
-1	this film is about a man's life going wrong .  his business is failing ,  and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts .   the plot is complete chaos .  it simply does not make sense .  in fact ,  nothing in the film makes sense .  the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it .  it is a shame ,  because the sets and costumes are done well ,  and are visually stimulating enough .  the shots are well composed throughout the film .  however ,  these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling .  i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film .  it is such a waste of their talents .  this film is very bad .  avoid it !  !
-1	i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film .  .  .  . the road side bar scene in russia .  in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line -  " 50 dollars .  . you drink and talk "  ,  but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could ,  so i declined to take this speaking part on .  i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience .  .  .  . and who knows .  .  .  these lines could have ended up there with lines such as  " i'll be back "  and  " quite frankly my dear ,  i don't give a damn "  .  had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski .    as time goes on ,  i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film .   even though i spent a whole day on the set ,  in south wales hot-spot barry island ,  no one could tell me what the actual storyline was .  the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it .  .  .  .  .  things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films .  .  .  .   still .  .  .  .  . on the positive side .  .  .  . i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break .  i had no idea who he was ,  as  " notting hill "  was yet to be released ,  and not an inkling that he might be welsh .  made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s .  it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
-1	this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen .  pure drivel .  how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine ,  or have empathy for her ,  is beyond me .  i felt i was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder .  just terrible .   in its most generous light ,  this can be seen as an attempt at producing and  " art "  film - except i could not ,  for the life of me ,  find any art in it at all .   if this woman had lived in todays' world ,  she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti-psychotic medications .  that ,  or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman .  why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her - and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort .
-1	in the wake of lock ,  stock and two smoking barrels ,  the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then .  in one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine ,  the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'the best film of the century' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because ,  at the time of writing ,  it was the only film that had been released in 2000 .  looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made ,  uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia's lads mags brigade  rhys ifans ,  sadie frost ,  nick moran and joseph fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel .  that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is ,  or perhaps simply don't think it matters .  something to do with ifans' businessman being set up with steven berkoff's homicidal russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme  ( it's never clear which because no-one ever asks )  by fiennes' crooked irish accountant ,  who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company .  things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on ,  ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald's ludicrously accented russian temptress ,  berkoff keeps on saying  " bizniss "  and  " francis drake "  and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts .   when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr ,  you know a film is in deep trouble .  with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget ,  it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own ,  sitting there like a joke shop dog turd .
-1	i felt rancid aluminium was a complete waste of two hours ,  the plot line was thin and confusing ,  the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents .  the camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey ,  it just made it even more difficult to watch .  one of the most annoying aspects of rancid aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience .  the best performances weren't anything to do with acting .  in fact probably the most convincing performance came from dani behr of all people ,  although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary .  do not under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep ,  there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash .
-1	i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films ,  but i can not believe this got past the script stage .  the dialogue is appalling ,  the acting very dodgy ,  the accents just awful ,  and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best .   i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad .  joseph fiennes ,  pretty as he is ,  might just have killed his career as quickly as it started .   the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage .
-1	i read james hawes book .  it was pretty neat ,  not great ,  but entertaining enough .  without having read the book i wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on ,  and it was still a stretch with that knowledge .   literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe .  half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick .   never before or since as a film made me feel so angry .  the mattress sequels came closest ,  but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did .   since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind i am now unable to even look at any book by james hawes without feeling angry .  that is the depth of hatred i have for this piece of sh*t .  no ,  that's unfair .  let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is rancid aluminium .   plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema .
-1	where do you begin with a movie as bad as this ?   do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes ?  the over-the-top acting ?  the dreadful script ?   no .  you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at .  i know i do .  i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire  ( usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags )  .  however ,  cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product .   i went three days after it opened with two other mates .  the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own .   and that was on cheap night .   either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is .   not since the days of the avengers  ( 1998 )  have i felt so short changed since watching a movie .  if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it .   tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set ;  keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage ;  barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance ,  rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary .   mind you ,  considering she used to be in the word ,  any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with .   the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious .  if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say  " fak !  "  for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street .   otherwise ,  bargepoles required .
-1	this is a film that had a lot to live down to  .  on the year of its release legendary film critic barry norman considered it the worst film of the year and i'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated   to be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word  "  plot  "  is used because as far as i can see there is no plot as such  .  there's something involving russian gangsters  ,  a character called pete thompson who's trying to get his wife sarah pregnant  ,  and an irish bloke called sean  .  how they all fit into something called a  "  plot  "  i'm not sure  .  it's difficult to explain the plots of guy ritchie films but if you watch any of his films i'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing  .  likewise a james bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes  .  you will have a serious problem believing rancid aluminium has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained   taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching  .  sadie frost has appeared in some of the worst british films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent  .  steven berkoff gives acting a bad name  (  and he plays a character called kant which sums up the wit of this movie  )  while one of the supporting characters is played by a tv presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this   the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable  .  i saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching i was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching  ,  but by now i've mainly forgotten why  .  but this doesn't alter the fact that i remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
-1	in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and  " king arthur "  ,  on dvds chosen by others for an evening's  " entertainment "  and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination ,  and is content as long as they get  " action "  .  both movies were utter rubbish .   whatever happened to character development ?  whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ?  whatever happened to acting ?  and ,  when watching something that vaguely purports to be  " historical "  ,  whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy ,  some realistic idea of the  " political map "  of the time ,  even some slight flavour of the era ,  especially in its social attitudes .  why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america ?  i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that  " little was known "  of the dark ages .  not so .  considerable amounts are known ,  with much learned scholarship on the era ,  but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework .   i only wish i could vote 0/10
-1	elizabeth ward gracen ,  who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's  " bimbo eruptions "   ( they have pills for that now !  )  is probably the weakest element of this show .  it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met ,  but there is some conflict ,  and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence .   then you have the character of nick wolf .  basically ,  your typical unshaven 90's hero ,  with the typical  " sexual tension "  storyline .   ( seriously ,  why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex .  )  this was a joint canadian/french production ,  so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york ,  and the other half is in paris .  .  .  just like highlander did .
-1	by far the worst movie of all time .  even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey .  i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled  " the treasure "  but was changed to  " sharks' treasure "  in order to take advantage of the excitement created by  " jaws "  .  i think sharks were in one scene of this movie ;  the fact that they happened to be included in this  " thriller "  was supposed to sell tickets .  didn't work .  anytime something  " good "  happens in the movie ,  the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made .  gee ,  do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor ?  could they have made it any more obvious ?  the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing .  that's cause enough for celebration .
-1	sheesh !  what a dreadful movie .  dodgy camera work ,  a script with more corn than kellogg's ,  and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it .    to cap it all ,  it doesn't know which audience to aim at - we have cornel wilde - or is that corny wilde ?  - getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette ,  dear oh dear ,  and in another awkward scene we have the baddie ,  lobo ,  forcing his ,  ahem ,  if you will ,  'male friend' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini .  try explaining that one to the kids .  .  .   throw in an overly contrived treasure island-cum-jaws type storyline ,  and the result is a film so unintentionally funny ,  it's enjoyable - i shouldn't expect a special edition dvd any time soon ,  though .
-1	i've seen this film because i had do  ( my job includes seeing movies of all kinds )  .  i couldn't stop thinking  " who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival !  "  it wasn't only boring ,  the actors were awful as well .  it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen .
-1	cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south atlantic .   the treasure-hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces .  wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold bullion .   after the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing ,  shoving ,  arguing ,  and listening to wilde's annoying health tips ,  5 crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things .  now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a shark's stomach looks like .   at least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in 'the naked prey' 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition .   made on a budget of 75 cents .
-1	this movie was a real torture fest to sit through .  its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it .  when it does stoop to putting in its argument ,  it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts  ;  all that's missing is someone crying  " when is someone going to think of the children !  "  .  while watching this movie ,  i kept thinking  " where'd you hear that ?  "  or  " that can't possibly be true "  - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources .  and bless 'em ,  the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power ;  to be fair ,  that might be the fault of the film-makers ,  but equally fairly ,  it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars .   as for the performers .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i've enjoyed ,  and i'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause .  but they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over ,  now that the 60s have passed them by .  particularly embarrassing are graham nash and james taylor .  nash seems to be trying too hard - he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told  ( not that i blame him )  ,  but desperate to feel noticed and included .  james taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest  " anthem "  ever ,   " stand and fight "  ,  in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine .  in fact ,  most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing .  nobody seems worked up by this event ,  as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all .  it's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall ,  of the band orleans ,  and responsible for some of the wimpiest mor pop of the 70s .   ( remember ,  if you dare ,   " dance with me "  and  " still the one "  .  )  it's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music .  the cause is supposedly life-or-death ,  but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the catskills .  except maybe gil-scott heron - his protest number  " we almost lost detroit "  is on topic at least ,  but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being .   only bruce springsteen's performance raises a pulse ;  i've never been a big fan of the boss ,  but he absolutely smokes ,  no question .  part of me thinks he was taped separately ,  at another event ,  and edited into this movie to give wake the audience .  compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction here ,  it's no wonder bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll .   but even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting .  i don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film ,  but the shots are unnecessarily static ,  broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils .  now ,  some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with ;  and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch  " rust never sleeps "  or  " the last waltz "  to see a movie like this done with more skill .  and with more exciting musicians .    so really ,  there's only two things to watch this movie for :  springsteen's stellar performance ,  and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline .
-1	ok ,  i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film .  let's name the problems .  .  . first this film has much of the same crew that the first two had .  it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion .  why is it that they can't get shetan's dam's name correct or her color ?  ?  in the black stallion returns ,  we learn the sagr was the black's chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ?  wtf ?  and it's set in africa in 1946 and 1947 .  .  . i could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940's as well when the ship wrecks .  time line doesn't sound quite right to me .  also ,  as a goof ,  there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetan's father .  .  . upon further notice it appears to be a gelding .  ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way .  might be a cute family film to some but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year .
-1	i understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent i have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest ,  but i can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children .  parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies .  disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name .   technically ,  the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural .  personally i hate that ,  but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project .  the  " acting "  reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices .  thankfully it was a very short movie .   now ,  before i come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick ,  the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message .  far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is .  let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given :    if you are lost ,  don't worry ,  you will inevitably find your way home .   approach wild animals without any fear .   you can win any competition just because you  " know "  you can .   and my favorite ,  the final message left in the film :    it's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right .
-1	this extremely weak australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the pavlov dog experiment amongst horror movies .  you remember this famous  " conditioned reflex "  experiment from your school books ,  right ?  the russian scientist pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal's reflexes .  pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and ,  after a while ,  he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell .  what the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted aussie slasher flick ,  i hear you think ?  well ,  the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in  " nightmares "  is an exact variant on pavlov's experiment .  each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window ,  because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims .  so this means that ,  after a short while ,  inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass .  that way they still don't miss anything special !    regarding the quality of  " nightmares "  as a film i can be very brief .  this is a cheap ,  uninspired and largely imbecilic aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of american slasher movies .  in the early 60's ,  a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident .  twenty years later the same girl  helen selleck  is a successful stage actress ,  but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares .  she auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part .  shortly after the big premiere ,  everyone who's even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered .  it is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already .  i don't think i've ever seen a more obvious whodunit than  " nightmares "  and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment .  the murders are explicit and very bloody and there's also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to  " enjoy "  .  however ,  the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative .  the few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage .  the only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic ,  whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do .   " nightmares "  is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema ,  but hey ,  at least i gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible .
-1	jenny neumann  ( from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes ,  the american slasher hell night and others )  is helen selleck ,  an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production .  she's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her .  meanwhile ,  a black-gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass .   ***major spoiler***  the killer is obviously helen  ( she speaks in her dead mother's voice ,  washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl !  )  ,  but this has gratuitous heavy-breathing pov camera-work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise .   the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about ,  having or trying to have sex ,  and ,  in one case ,  even blackmailing their way into getting laid .  there's quite a bit of nudity and blood ,  but there's no sense of continuity ,  the photography is murky and the editing  ( by colin eggleston ,  who also scripted and produced )  is terrible .  the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi's film of the same name and argento's opera  ( both of which are better than this one  )  by five years though ,  and neumann is pretty hot .
-1	this is a direct sequel to 'the mummy's hand'  ( 1940 )  ,  because the lead character ,  stephen banning  ( played by dick foran )  is now thirty years older and is relating the story  ( with the help of archival footage )  to his son's fiancé .  there are only two unusual aspects to the film :  the early death of banning ,  and the presence of turhan bey .   lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing ,  though given the nature of his role ,  he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about .  there's nothing scary about his presence ,  except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé ,  isobel  ( elyse knox )  .  dick foran gets second billing ,  but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes !  we'd have to wait until 'psycho'  ( 1960 )  when a lead character  ( janet leigh )  dies way before the end of the movie !  banning's buddy from the first film ,  babe jenson  ( now henson )  ,  shows up a little later looking much ,  much ,  older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original .  it's hard to believe it's the same actor !  unfortunately ,  this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes .  it's then left up to banning's son john  ( played by bit player john hubbard )  to led the chase to the cemetery--no !  the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to banning's house to burn it down and kill the mummy .  sound universally familiar ?    turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest ,  mehmet bey ,  to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis .  with his 'exotic' voice and appearance ,  it's too bad he gets so easily killed .  a better movie would have had 'babe' take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy ,  with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay .  but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films ,  put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universal's other clunkers ,  although he also did 'don winslow of the navy'  ( 1942 )  as well as 'don winslow of the coast guard'  ( 1943 )  which also featured elyse knox .   elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies  ( 1946-1949 )  ,  and of course ,  turhan bey ,  with 43 movie and tv credits ,  is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr .  x'  ( 1948 )  .   the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric  ( with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office )  than the first 'kharis' mummy film ,  but there's little else of interest or excitement .   i'll give it a 3 .
-1	the mummy's tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy's hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past .   while i absolutely loved  " the mummy "  with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep ,  and quite liked  " the mummy's hand "  with tom tyler as kharis  ( which is the direct prequel to this film )  ,  i was not as taken with  " the mummy's tomb "  .   it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting .  lon chaney jr is okay as kharis ,  but doesn't really stand out .  and i guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out .  there's nothing really terrible here ,  but nothing really outstanding either ,  so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy's tale .
-1	1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10  ( dir - harold young )  :  the 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective .  the story is similar and the results are ho-hum .  this time the story's location is the u . s .  as the egyptian priest's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb .  this time the mummy is played by lon chaney ( which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character )  .  the new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice .  again ,  a girl gets in the way ,  as the priest falls for one of the descendent's fiancé and wants her ,  yes--- to be immortal with him ( haven't we heard this before ?  )  .  the plan is ,  of course ,  thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches ( similar to the frankenstein monster )  and the burning of the creature ends the story .  .  . how do they get a sequel ?  ?  i guess you'll find out with the next one in the series  ?  ?  or not .  .  .  .  .
-1	nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction .  this is the case with  " the mummy's tomb .  "   the script is leftover ideas from older ,  better universal horror flicks like  " dracula "  and  " frankenstein .  "  the direction is trite and stale .  the acting is mediocre .  even chaney's kharis is feeble compared to tom tyler's in  " the mummy's hand ,  "  and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabanne's vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film !   universal realized how bad this movie was ,  and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as  " the mummy's ghost "  with a much better script and better director .  the result was likely the best film in their four film  " mummy "  cycle ,  although not anywhere near as good as karl freund's 1932 original .   cabanne's footage raises this film to a 3 .  the  " new "  stuff is a 2 at best .  dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn't have to appear in dreck like this anymore !
-1	cheap ,  mediocre sequel to the successful  " the mummy's hand "  has presumably dead evil professor andoheb ( george zucco ) preparing his predecessor mehemet bey ( turhan bey ) for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy kharis ( lon chaney ,  jr who has no reason being in the disguise .  . any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims ) in the goal of killing the surviving members of the banning family whose patriarch stephen ( dick foran ) and assistant babe hanson ( wallace ford ) retrieved the mummified corpse of princess ananka from her tomb in egypt .  . andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian custom .  bey and the mummy kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the high priest of karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise .  every full moon ,  bey will feed kharis a form of liquid derived of several tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes .  bey commands kharis to kill stephen and his sister jane ( mary gordon )  ,  while also biding time for babe to return so that he will become victim # 3 .  dr .  john banning ( john hubbard ) plans to wed isobel ( elyse knox )  ,  but doesn't know that bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with kharis' help .  john's life is in danger because of his father .  . he's also the last remaining member of the banning line .  if bey has isobel ,  there's no chance of any more bannings being born .  the police must find kharis and the one responsible for his carnage .  . bey .   this film is a continuation from hand set years later as members of that film ,  foran ,  ford & zucco all appear in  " aging "  make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the bannings .  the cornball romance of john and isobel seems merely in this plot so that bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up .  and ,  bey merely sees her frolicking with john on the grass .  . the whole  " love-at-first-sight "  rubbish really didn't wash for me .  plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm .  . is any mummy really that powerful ?  this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it .  there really isn't that much story here and yes ,  typical of universal monster pictures ,  even in america a mob of people will light .  . ho hum .  . torches going after kharis .  you know how it'll end .  . john and the super-powerful kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame .
-1	overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point .  so she became an actress - so what ?  she learned to love - big deal .  there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations ,  but the kind which is bad for the movie ,  causing it to often seem absurd .   summer phoenix ,  playing the lead ,  talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person ,  so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point .  we are told early on  ( in that  " barry lyndon " -like narration )  that she learned to hide her emotions ,  which certainly explains her autistic stone-face ,  but the movie suffers for it .  she basically walks around like a zombie ,  and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions .  occasionally ,  the movie had that dull ,  sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie .  is it one ?  i wouldn't be at all surprised .   summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix .  nepotism rarely works .   if you'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list ,  with over 350 pictures/entries ,  contact me by e-mail .
-1	a resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge .  a lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition .  universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas .  most of the budget was probably spent on lon chaney jr .  to star as kharis ,  the mummy .   other players are george zucco ,  wallace ford ,  turhan bey ,  dick foran and elyse knox .   how much longer can this madness continue ?

-1	this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate .  it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died ,  idaho ,  colorado territories ,  and montana .  it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man , ' 'good man . ' the script is horrible ;  there is very little direction ,  and lousy acting .  dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife .  mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade .  in real life ,  jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent .  he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking .  when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city ,  montana .  to insure that he could never terrorize them again ,  vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately .  this is a horrible movie .  i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will ,  even to this day .
-1	back  ( again )  in scotland ,  lassie is  ( again )  on trial for her life .  because the faithful dog sleeps on her master's grave ,  she must be put to death ,  according to law .  oddly ,  it is also explained that lassie had no  " legal "  owner ,  which is ,  apparently ,  also against an old scottish law .  if ,  after three days ,  no owner is located ,  dogs must be destroyed .  edmund gwenn  ( as john traill )  pleads lassie's case ,  which leads to an extended flashback ,  showing lassie's adoption by donald crisp  ( as john  " jock "  gray )  .   although it's based on an interesting ,  original story  (  " greyfriars bobby "  )  ,   " challenge to lassie "  revisits several earlier lassie situations ;  and ,  it does not improve upon them .  comparatively speaking ,  this one is sloppy and unexciting ;  and ,  it's a disappointing follow-up to  " the sun comes up "   ( 1949 )  ******* .  geraldine brooks  ( as susan brown )  and several of the other performers may be charming ,  but can't elevate this one .  little jimmy hawkins  ( from  " it's a wonderful life "  )  is among the notable children supporting lassie ;  much later ,  he will grow up to marry  " dark shadows " ' bewitching  " angelique "   ( lara parker )  .
-1	the perfectly stupid weapon .  i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segal's movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie .  the plot is predictable ,  the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene .
-1	get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick .  speakman's considerable kempo skill  ( nice spin kicks ,  decent with the sticks - poor couch !  )  is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting .  the plot isn't half bad ;  just executed pretty poorly .  but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts ,  you're missing the boat entirely .  and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown ,  way way too few korean actors  ( even extras )  .
-1	bad plot  ( though good for a b-movie )  ,  good fast-paced fight scenes ,  at most a 5 out of 10 .  but something has always bothered me about this film :  how come mariska hargitay never speaks ?  in the tv version ,  she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman ,  even a kiss in a garden .  yet in the regular  ( video )  version ,  most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all .  this bothers me because it not only takes out a female  ( though cliched )  point-of-view to the film ,  it also makes the final shot seem creepy .  this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in ,  because in those scenes at least she has a personality ,  one that undercuts whatever speakman says .
-1	first of all ,  yes ,  animals have emotions .  if you didn't know that already ,  then i believe you are a moron .  but let's assume that none of us are morons .  we all know that animals have emotions ,  and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature ,  correct ?   what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are  " human "  .  the filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour ,  and when it happens they say ,   " that monkey is almost human !  "   ( that's actually a direct quote )  .   everything is in human terms .  they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs  " smile "  ,  but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means .  the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting .  they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat .   i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms .  i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages .  but instead ,  researchers keep falling back on pedantic ,  anthropomorphic observations and assumptions .  add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps  " celebrating christmas "  ,  and this was enough to turn my stomach .   but it doesn't end there .  half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities .  all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars ,  and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages .  one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning  ( though you have to be quick to notice it )  where a captive monkey says in sign language ,   " want out .  hurry go .  "   obscure references are made to  " stress tests "  and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine .  baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a  " mother figure "  .  and after 40 years of experiments ,  the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion :  monkeys have emotions .   one chimp named  " washoe "  has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose ,  and to this day she remains thus .  we get a brief glimpse  ( again through bars )  of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression .  personally ,  i don't need to see any further experimental data .  washoe ,  i apologize for our entire species .
-1	i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the '60s ,  i was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses ,  most notably ben ,  actress fay spain ,  and jody fair ,  who played angela in 1961's the young savages .  ben was one of the people at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago ,  about 1970 ,  when i had a nice chat with him and his  " career "  and life .  all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day .  wish i still had copies of those interviews ,  but time marches on ,  and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later .  ben was a really nice fellow ,  ekeing out a living  ( the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest ,  unless ,  of course they were big-name stars ,  and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars ,  at most !  good to know ben's still alive & kicking !  how 'bout a remake of creature ,  but 50 years older !  ugly then ,  uglier now !
-1	a shame that even a talented director ,  desplechin ,  could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress ,  phoenix ,  esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot .  in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight ,  the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer .  in an overly long running time ,  the redundancy of esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display .  the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin's instruction ,  just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same .  never feeling a convincing victory over esther's pain ,  we never feel a victory in phoenix's talent .
-1	this movie deserves credit for its original approach .  it combines elements of theater ,  film ,  and epic storytelling .  unfortunately ,  it falls flat on all levels .  the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything ;  it has camp ,  moralistic ,  and epic elements without ever committing to any of them .  as for the story itself ,  chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable ,  unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl .   most likely two types of people will see this ,  francophiles or arthuriophiles .  speaking as one of the latter ,  i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby ,  disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .
-1	and it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject  ( with a little help from wagner )  .   maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out ,  without the syberberg film to compare it to ,  which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources .  i actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film .  all i know is ,  the german version is pure magic ,  while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes .   the music .  .  .  la musique .  .  .  isn't even credited here on imdb .  .  .  but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th-14th centuries "  or something .  .  .  well it isn't a great help to the film .  it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy ,  comme le frommage mon cher !  !  !   rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive ,  too ,  and that doesn't help matters .  syberberg's parsifal was adorable ,  and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented .   .  .   .   i shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like .  i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater ,  the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty .  but even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer ,  i'm afraid .   points for earnestness ,  for chutzpah ,  but .  .  .  this film simply needed beau-coup more bucks .  it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheapo !  bon marche !  !  oh and yeah ,  it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected .  .  .  blah !
-1	this movie is probably the worst i have seen .  bad acting ,  bad script ,  bad everything .  comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting .  both cyborg  ( van damme ,  1989 )  and nemesis  ( olivier gruner ,  1993 )  are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's albert pyun who has directed these two as well !   the story is not original .  the world has become a terrible place ,  possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war ,  and people live under medieval circumstances .  a special breed of robots  ( cyborgs )  live on human blood and there's the story .  .  .  the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there  " prophecy "  and the humans need someone to stop them .  one girl together with a robot  ( kris kristofferson )  built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind .   in this movie the director tries some hong-kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far .  the movie fails miserably in this attempt .   i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new  " worst ever "  movie to relate to .  and to fans of the genre i recommend  " cyborg "  since i think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor .  and if you can't stand van damme then check out  " nemesis "  .   i rated this movie 1/10 .
-1	still a sucker for pyun's esthetic sense ,  i liked this movie ,  though the  " unfinished "  ending was a let-down .  as usual ,  pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy long's fights are extremely impressive .  beautifully photographed ,  this has the feel it was done for the big screen .
-1	knights was just a beginning of a series ,  a pilot ,  one might say .  the plot  ( i really shouldn't call it that ,  there wasn't any plot )  wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes ,  like [warning ,  i'm summarizing the plot] :   in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs  ( the bad guys )  but after the climax ,  nea found out that there were many many more left of them .  and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill ,  but after a month's training ,  nea could kill them with a single blow .   the movie was just pure kicking .  i wasn't surprised at all ,  when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer .   there was one positive thing in the whole movie :  it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends .  i recommend watching it ,  if you are in need of laughter .
-1	this move is about as bad as they come .  i was ,  however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery .  there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley ,  one of the most breathtaking places in the us .  it is also ,  starting with john ford ,  one of the most filmed .  in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point .
-1	once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be ,  and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap .  there is absolutely no talent included in this film - from a crappy script ,  to a crappy story to crappy acting .  amazing .  .  .
-1	vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel ,  however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android  ( kris kristofferson )  and a warrior woman  ( kathly long )  as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels  ( who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie )  of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie ,  the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets .  no ,  don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg .  strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren ,  however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it .  however despite the disastrous casting ,  kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie .  he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long .   ( and kristofferson is playing a robot )  despite the miscasting ,  kristofferson provides the few moments of interest .  lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure .  you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper .   ( this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack )  worst of all it ends in a what if sequel ,  thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event .   * out of 4- ( bad )
-1	someone needed to make a car payment .  .  .  this is truly awful .  .  .  makes jean claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind .  .  .  this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back .  .  .  luckily it produced severe somnolence .  .  .  from which i fell asleep .  how can actors of this caliber create this dog ?  i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre .  i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table .  $5 . 99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie .  .  .  if you really have to have it ,  wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell .   please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity .
-1	you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great .  the premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey .   the script is blasé' .  the actors don't have much to work with .  the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs .  it's a trademark that if the background is the desert ,  then the movie has no budget .   lack of budget is okay ,  if there's a story .   " solarbabies "  and  " blood of champions "  are examples of decent work from no $ .  but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich .  again ,  forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck .   finally ,  this movie commits the biggest crime of all :  it doesn't finish !  it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie .  but the rest never comes .  just odd .   just bad .
-1	there is a word for this sort of film ,  and that word is  " drivel .  "  it was drivel when it was a vhs rental ,  and it's drivel on satellite re-runs now .   it might fool you ,  because it has 2 moderately well-known names in kistofferson and henriksen ,  reasonable soundtrack music ,  and nice monument valley scenery .   it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot .   if that's all you want from a movie ,  then maybe this will keep you happy .   it's still drivel ,  though .
-1	this movie will promote the improvement of the mind .  read a book !  it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make .  i've seen  " b "  movies before but the  " c "  movie has just been invented .  i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into  " knights .  "  high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume .  embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind .  my roommate ,  who loves these types of movies even turned it off .  now that has to really tell you something .  if you watch this movie ,  and like it ,  i will pray for you .
-1	i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran ,  so i didn't know who had done it at first .  the longer i saw it ,  the more i started thinking ,   " jesus ,  this looks like an albert pyun flick .  "  wasn't quite sure ,  though ,  for two main reasons :  the photography was quite good  ( and the utah desert scenery was beautiful )  ,  and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon ,  a murderous cyborg ,  but with some style and a sense of humor .  paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out ,  because albert pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career .  unfortunately ,  paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone ,  and the movie's the worse for it .  lance henriksen ,  playing the evil head cyborg ,  growls his way through his part ,  as he's done in countless other movies like this .  i don't know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing ;  maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it .  he goes through the movie looking  ( and sounding )  like he just woke up ,  and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent .  kathy long ,  the nominal hero ,  has a great body ,  is attractive ,  has a great body ,  fights extremely well ,  has a great body ,  and doesn't have an iota of acting talent ,  but that doesn't matter in a movie like this .  this being an albert pyun film ,  it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love :  inane and idiotic dialog ,  choppy editing ,  and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ,   " ah ,  nobody'll ever notice .  "   as bad as this movie is ,  however ,  it's a shade above most of pyun's other efforts--this is  " citizen kane "  compared to his brain-numbing  " adrenaline :  feel the rush "  ,  for example .  the fights are pretty well done ,  if repetitive  ( after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other ,  you find yourself saying ,   " alright already ,  go to something else "  )  ,  and long is very athletic  ( and ,  as a previous poster has noted ,  has a great derrière )  .  it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination ,  but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun's usual extravaganzas .  you could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse ,  granted ,  but worse nonetheless .
-1	the point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime .  summer phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment .  even in the lengthy scenes of esther's acting lessons ,  we never see her carry out the teacher's instructions .  after suffering through esther's  ( largely self-inflicted )  pain in excruciating detail ,  we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph .   the obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence .  yet the causes of this pain  ( poverty ,  quasi-autism ,  judaism ,  sexual betrayal )  never come together in a coherent whole .  a 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends .  esther kahn is still not ready to go before an audience .
-1	in the ravaged wasteland of the future ,  mankind is terrorized by cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered a new source of fuel :  human blood .  commanded by their vicious leader jōb  ( lance henriksen )  ,  the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos ,  a densely populated human outpost .   only one force can stop jōb's death marchthe cyborg gabriel  ( kris kristofferson )  ,  who is programmed to destroy jōb and his army .   in the ruins of a ransacked village ,  gabriel finds nea  ( kathy long )  ,  a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier .  now she wants revenge .  they strike a pact :  gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos .   five-time kick-boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high-speed adventure that delivers plenty of action .  also stars gary daniels  ( as david )  and scott paulin  ( as simon )  .
-1	this is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that albert pyun made in 1993 - and it's the bad one .  apparently all his energy went into  " nemesis "  which was an entertaining non-stop action movie ,  and had a much more expensive look .   " knights "  is clunky and cheesy ,  a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game  ( new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible )  .  the only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is kathy long ;  not a particularly attractive woman ,  but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine .  as for kris kristofferson ,  considering his age at the time  ( 58 )  ,  i hope his stunt double was well paid .   ( *1/2 )
-1	set in a post-apocalyptic environment ,  cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population .  they basically keep them as livestock ,  as they need fresh human blood to live off .  nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid ,  and years have past when she came face-to-face with the cyborgs again ,  but this time she's saved by the cyborg gabriel ,  who was created to destroy all cyborgs .  job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city ,  while nea  ( with revenge on mind )  pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she'll get him to gabriel .   cheap low-rent cyborg / post-apocalyptic foray by writer / director albert pyun  ( who made  " cyborg "  prior to it and the blistering  " nemsis "  the same year )  is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties .  very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story ,  as the turgid script is weak ,  corny and overstated .  the leaden banter tries to be witty ,  but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments .  most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine .  the material could've used another polish up ,  as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions ,  lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone .  the open-ended ,  cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt ,  especially since a sequel has yet to be made .  makes it feel like that that run out of money ,  and said  " time to pack up .  let's finish it off another day  ( or maybe in another decade )  .  there's no rush .  "  however it did find it rather diverting ,  thanks largely to its quick pace ,  some well-executed combat and george mooradian's gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop .  performances are fair .  kris kristofferson's dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self-assured ,  psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression .  however her acting is too wooden .  a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouth-watering performance of pure ham ,  as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown .  scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too .  pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces ,  involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow-motion .  seeping into the background is a scorching ,  but mechanical sounding music score .  the special effects and make-up fx stand up fine enough .  watchable ,  but not quite a success and it's minimal limitations can be a cause of that .
-1	every once in a while i will rent an action/adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important .  this is why i own a copy of charlie's angels  ( 2000 )  - not a quality film ,  but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while .  one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason .   in any case ,  i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged .  for the most part ,  i got what i wanted .  the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode ,  and the kathy long's acting was very community theater  ( not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress )  .  there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs .  somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately ,  most of them die pretty darned quick .   like most martial arts films ,  the further you get into the movie ,  the more emphasis there is on action ,  and the plot  ( which wasn't strong to begin with )  deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting .  however ,  the more kathy long fights ,  the more time the director devotes to her backside .  by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long's tight red shorts were center screen .   unfortunately ,  there just wasn't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time .  if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours - by all means ,  go to the grocery store and spend the  . 50 cents on the rental .  there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie .   just don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours .   unless ,  of course ,  you happen to like kathy long's derrière .  then you might want to purchase a copy .
-1	elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying ,  untalented self in this film .  this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy .  rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better .  james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie .  the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long .  the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up .  hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age .   0/10 .
-1	" giant "  is one of the most boring ,  overly-long hollywood contraptions ever .  many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy .  rock hudson ,  elizabeth taylor ,  and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production .  a central notion to this movie ,  that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land ,  is absurd ,  and i know this because i'm from houston .  a couple of scenes ,  especially dean serving taylor coffee ,  redeem this otherwise boring film .  for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas ,  see  " hud "   ( one of paul newman's great performances )  or  " the last picture show .  "
-1	with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr .   " epic "  of miscastings and misreadings ,  i can only wonder that the james dean  " legend "  could survive this outing ,  i submit that then-studio obeisances to bankable box office  " giants "  came a cropper of its own 'gigantismoses' .  nor were rock and liz that much better off .  let us just say that the televised  " dallas "  was the authentic  " heir ,  "  even if contemp ( tuous )  latterday  " texans "  like lay and delay ,  not to mention our putative  " president "  of these here yewbenighted states of amurrika ,  perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions .  i never read edna ferber's original ,  but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein .  and all those well-paid ,  i would imagine ,   " supporting "  actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding ,   " giant "  is ,  to me at least ,  a midget of scant merit ,  never mind the promo campaigns .
-1	as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring .  even liz taylor ,  james dean ,  chill wills ,  and dennis hopper can't float this overbloated boat .  taylor actually looks bad--wrong wardrobe ,  wrong hair ,  and wrong makeup--a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career .  hopper gives the only believable performance ,  and dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don't remember him for--a comic actor .  rock hudson is his usual prototype of barbie doll ken and makes one wonder what a ,  say ,  redford could have done with the male lead .  there is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes ,  just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other .  except for hopper ,  there is no character development ,  only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery .  to its credit ,  the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects ,  and it does have size ,  making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests .  those with the dvd version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk .  you won't be missing anything of interest .
-1	this movie is just crap .  even though the directors claim to be part of that oi-culture ,  it's still a very ,  very bad directorial debut .  the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact ,  that they are all amateurs and never acted before ,  but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing .  there's no timing at all in that movie .  i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie  ( it's their first feature )  ,  that they actually never really asked themselves ,  what story they wanna tell .  i met ben  ( one of the directors )  on several occasions and he's a nice and thoughtful guy ,  but that doesn't make him a director .  i think ,  that  " american history x "  is full of clichés ,  but somehow manages to transport a story .   " oi ! warning "  is full of clichés ,  doesn't tell anything new or provocative and  ( -that's the sad thing about this movie )  it's far from any oi ! -reality .   if you wanna see weird but great german films ,  watch the movies of michael haneke ,  christoph schlingensief ,  oskar roehler ,  hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel :   benny's video funny games die unberührbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxmäuschenstill  .  .  .   *** out of ten ,  because of the topic and the photography
-1	here's yet another blasphemous european story in which they blast the religion of their country .   ( these atheist filmmakers are relentless .  )  here we see a brutal blasting of catholics and/or the catholic clergy  ( and i am not catholic )  .   this won actually won an academy award for bes foreign film .  that's probably because the story made catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak .  one of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else .  he's portrayed as nothing but an idiot .  no wonder the secular- dominated academy loved this movie .   also ,  there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story .  the daughters take turns seducing the  " seminary "  student  ( who states he studied for six years but says he's an agnostic !  )  .  i mean ,  how blasphemous is this film ?  ?  !  !  !   this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business ,  worldwide  ( not just hollywood )  .
-1	i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one .  a lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre .  usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre ,  but the challenge generally resides in making it original ,  new and inventive .  this movie fails to do so .   there is no sense of who the characters really are ,  apart from sylvie moreau's  ( who is the real star of this movie ,  not isabelle blais )  .  they fit into this one-dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative .   the pacing of the movie can become annoying ,  rhythm lacks ,  and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups .  i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally ,  or rather ,  making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious .  of course ,  along with that ,  you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched .   i can't believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive .  if you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy ,  this is not it .  or rather ,  this a poor attempt at it .  you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicks .   les aimants is a good movie for what it is .  but it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's .
-1	i recently watched belle epoque ,  thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film .  i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film .  maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now ,  the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times .  aside from predictability of the plot ,  some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline  ( ex .  a certain event at the wedding )  .  at times the film was a bit preachy in it's ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church .  the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments ,  the scenery ,  and the character of violeta being a strong ,  independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics .
-1	an allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes ,  including improper use of a broom ,  are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high-school jocks in glen ridge ,  new jersey ,  by a  " mildly retarded "  student  ( heather matarazzo )  .  the investigation and building of the case are handed over to the da's office ,  where ally sheedy and eric stoltz are put in charge .   rumors about the case spread through glen ridge ,  an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community .   ( one of their fathers is a police lieutenant .  )  nobody believes matarazzo .   " our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement ,  rape her ,  and subject her to such sexual humiliation .  "  the question is whether sheedy and stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial .  matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff .  she's desperate for love and friendship ,  and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements .  a slimy reporter says ,   " you can trust me ,  "  but it turns out the reporter can't be trusted at all .  another student ,  a very popular girl in school ,  pulls a linda tripp on matarazzo ,  pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results !  as a consequence ,  watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster .  at first it looks like a good case for sheedy and stoltz .  but then ,  oops ,  the community organizes against the law .  then it looks good again .  but then the reporter interferes .  then that obstacle is no sooner overcome ,  than linda tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate matarazzo was lying .   ( well ,  actually ,  she was lying -- but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her .  )  then that's overcome ,  but matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn't want to be characterized as  " retarded .  "  eric stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor .  i say that for the simple reason that he and i lived in pago pago around the same time .   ( i hope he wasn't the kid i had that altercation with at the bar of the seaside club .  if he was ,  i take back my compliment .  )  ally sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize .  she did a marvelous self-restrained job in  " fine art "  but i didn't sense any particular effort being put into this role ,  which was rather formulaic anyway .  i mean ,  neither she nor stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what's essentially a comic book story .   the producers and director had the good sense to choose heather matarazzo for the role of victim .  the very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely ,  neotenous blond .  instead ,  matarazzo ,  without being at all ugly ,  looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up .  nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle .  she has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to ,  which is all for the good .   matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film .  the jocks are stereotypes .  pure evil .  they think themselves above the law ,  barge in on some nice girl's party in east orange ,  trash the place during a party far worse than  " la dolce vita's "  climactic orgy ,  and leave without explanation or apology .  they deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do .   i referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is .  it challenges none of our prejudices .  it reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into good and evil .  and we don't have a moment's doubt about who's who .  what i'm waiting for -- not really ,  that's just rhetorical -- is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others ,  but in which the victim is lying in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right-thinking folk like the rest of us .   the film is based on a true story ,  as are so many others we've all seen ,  and even more fictional features .   ( eg .  ,   " the accused "  .  )  some are good ,  some are strictly routine .  okay .  fair enough .  now when do we get to see a film about the tawana brawley case ,  in which the teen-aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days ,  then had her friends strip her ,  tie her up ,  and smear her with dirt ,  so she could claim she'd been abducted and raped by the police ?  now that would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not .
-1	i am normally a spike lee fan .  it takes some time to really get into his  " mojo "  ,  but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart ,  lee is a genius .  unlike the 25th hour or bamboozled  ( two of my favorite films of his )  ,  there was no clear story in this film .  i was able to understand the struggle between washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others ,  but for some odd reason lee was never able to get the true feeling out .  washington did a decent job with what was handed to him ,  but you could tell that this was not lee's favorite film .  not only did lee direct this film ,  but he also wrote it .  you could tell .  the camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film .  this film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty .  lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with do the right thing .  of all the films i have seen lee direct ,  this was the brightest and more modest of his films .  it was almost as if he created a hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own .  i don't know if he saw the money from do the right thing and ran with it ,  or what  but this film did not demonstrate his true talent .   for anyone out there that has seen this film ,  and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by spike lee afterwards due to this film ,  i suggest you give him a second chance .  don't get me wrong ,  i see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you ,  but lee does grow up .  his work becomes more of his own ,  and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films .  it took me awhile to watch the 25th hour ,  but when i did ,  it was sheer brilliance .  perhaps it was the actors ,  perhaps the story ,  but lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown .  i guess that is what i was hoping mo' better blues would turn out to be .  this really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up ,  but instead all i got was denzel being denzel .  he really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation ,  and i do consider him the sydney poitier of cinema ,  but this was not the film to showcase his talent .   another issue that i had with this film was the use of spike's sister playing one of the love interests .  i don't know about you ,  and your family ,  but i do not think that i could have filmed a sex scene with my sister .  i don't care who the actor is or how much money i am getting paid ,  i would never do it .  it is just something that i never wish to see ,  but apparently that is different for spike .  he went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse .  it was sad and it even made me blush .  also ,  i need somebody to answer me this .  what was flavor flav doing introducing this film ?  so ,  i am sitting there on my couch ,  ready to start the film ,  when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film ,  then he acknowledges himself .  that did not build for a strong remaining of the story .  again ,  i felt that lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent .  perhaps that is how he could afford both denzel and wesley in the same movie without any explosions .   there were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end .  don't get me wrong ,  this was a very bad movie ,  but there is always a diamond in every alleyway .  the scene when bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing .  he continually went back and forth ,  weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that lee was actually behind the camera .  it was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes .  the other scene that was worth watching was the way that lee introduced and ended the film .  by keeping the same pacing and direction ,  he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life .  other than these two moments ,  the rest of the film was pure rubbish ,  not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind .   grade :  ** out of *****
-1	things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee .   bleek gilliam  ( denzell washington )  is a happenin' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog .  his problems include an incompetent manager ,  a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he's playing musical mattress with .  the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music .  the band's manager ,  giant ,  has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible .  it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man .   as bleek ,  denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm .  he's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art ,  dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness .  he simply lacks the fire .  wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee's torpid dialogue .  as giant ,  lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction .  loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek's joe buck he adopts a limp and even the  " i'm walkin' here "  moment from midnight cowboy .  in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it .   lee's script is all tepid argument ,  heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down .  the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek ,  giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles .  completing this travesty is lee's pretentious visual style .  tracking shots ,  zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes .  they just wander .   blues is lee's love letter to jazz  ( made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets )  and it's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve .  jazz on film is better served by tavernier's  " round midnight "  and eastwood's  " bird "  which get below the surface ,  reveal more sides of the form ,  the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon .  this spike lee joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz .  it's some pretty bad homegrown .
-1	there are two groups of people .  .  . those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people .  while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films ,  i can also honestly say that i can't stand some of them .  my opinion ,  by the way ,  is not just some knee-jerk reaction--i have seen most of fellini's films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors .  with this in mind ,  i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini .  they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the  " intelligensia "  ,  while the average person would never sit through some of their films .  heck ,  even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films .  so ,  since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses ,  it's not surprising that their films are so often praised--it's like a cult !  if you don't believe me ,  think about many of godard's films such as first name carmen or alphaville ,  .  .  . or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits ?  these films abound with boredom ,  weirdness and incomprehensibility .  now i am not saying a film can't be weird  ( after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer )  ,  but it must be watchable !   now on to this movie .  somehow ,  fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy .  this is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable .  instead of cheap sexual thrills ,  the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul .  i know some of this must have been fellini's intention ,  but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since sutherland's lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself !  unfortunately ,  when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades ,  there really isn't anything else to watch .   an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini's wife ,  giulietta masina .  considering that in addition to this ,  that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman ,  it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen .  i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well .  this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting .  don't say i didn't warn you !
-1	this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for fellini .  about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon .  this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence ,  opulence and sexual challenge .  sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer .  the art direction and costume design are however outstanding .  the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter .  also nominated  ( oddly )  was the disjointed ,  pointless and almost inacessible screenplay .  go figure !  !  the film on video is only 150 minutes ,  16 minutes short of the original running time .  this viewer was grateful .
-1	in a way this is the disaster fellini has been working towards all his life .  the line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small ,  and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings .  that said ,   " casanova "  left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by bukowski :     " casanova died too ,  just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all .  to say that he lived well is true ;  to say i could spit on his grave without feeling is also true .  the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find ;  that is why the human race stands where it does today :  we have bred the clever and lasting casanovas ,  all hollow inside ,  like the easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children .  "    as far as i could make it out ,  this is the position fellini takes regarding his subject ;  granted ,  with more empathy ,  but disgusted nonetheless .   casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior ,  themes fellini dealt with more pointedly in  " satyricon "  .  the succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn ,  just without the coherence ;  and donald sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction .   yet ,  there might just be a point in portraying casanova as an unsightly fool .  and i challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious ;  fellini couldn't .  more than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro ,  for sure ,  but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else .  i find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film .  it was a story not worth telling .
-1	i should explain why i gave this .  .  .  " piece of art "  1 star rating out of possible 10 .  simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased .  probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed .   i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so - i think that's disgusting and pretty terrible  ( in all the possible contextual meanings )  ,  but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called  " historical drama "  - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it  ( and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible )  .  but the thing about  " historical drama "  genre is that it's a sub-category of the  " trash movies "  where john romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it can't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so ,  or it was simply bad .  it's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting ,  bad screenplay and bad everything else .  and by some turn of faith - i am one of them too .  there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved !  but that's definitely an opinion of mine and doesn't have match with anyones' else .   what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then fellini's casanova is definitely the choice ,  but heed my advice and don't rate it by default means .
-1	as a dane i'm proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years .  it's a terrible shame ,  however ,  that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism .  in fact ,  it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies ,  and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters .   i know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie ,  so let me stress that  " villa paranoia "  would be a terrible film under any circumstances .  the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film .  furthermore ,  waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money .    erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings .  i particularly enjoyed  " de frigjorte "   ( 1993 )  .  as an actor he is usually funny ,  though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies ,  namely that of a working-class slob who's down on his luck ,  partly because he's a slob but mostly because of society ,  and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community .    this is problem number one in  " villa paranoia "  ;  clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer ,  which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible .    it is much worse ,  however ,  that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on .  for instance ,  the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work .  after that ,  the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge .  this is symptomatic of the whole movie ;  there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters ,  and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is :  telling instead of showing .  thus ,  at one point ,  you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels ,  because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings ;  and later on ,  voice-over is abruptly introduced ,  quite possibly as an afterthought ,  to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude .  fortunately ,  at this point you're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters ,  let alone the so-called story .   the acting ,  which has frequently been a problem in clausen's movies ,  can be summed up in one sad statement :  søren westerberg bentsen ,  whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother ,  is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast .   i give this a 2-out-of-10 rating .
-1	1st watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 ( dir-jim kammerud & brian smith )  :  drab and un-spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated `101 dalmatians . ' yes ,  the movie continues where it ended in the first one ,  but the problem is that it plays out much like the original .  one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story ,  which this one doesn't have .  the animation is also very un-spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again .  when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc .  .  etc .  probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out .
-1	i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2 ,  but this is possibly worse than both titles .  first of all ,  i didn't like the animation ,  very saturday-morning-cartoon ,  only worse in some scenes .  i liked some of the characters ,  namely thunderbolt and patch ,  but the other characters ,  like cruella were mediocre .  cruella was truly villainous in the original ,  but she lost her quality in the sequel .  what she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly .  also her artist companion lars was a joke to be honest with you ,  and roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight .  the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt ,  with the exception of jodi benson ,  the accent ruined it for me .  there were some good moments ,  but the whole plot seemed bloated for me ,  and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode .  all in all ,  a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book .  sorry ,  i can only give this a 3/10 ,  it just wasn't my cup of tea .  bethany cox
-1	i mean the word  " pedestrian "  .  seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen .  faith domergue can do better than this .  she is supposed to be the mysterious ,  vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson  ( there's an idea ,  eh ?  )  .  instead she's a common would-be housewife of the fifties ,  and the single ,  flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee .  as for the rest of the cast ,  they are all so earnestly  " all-american "  that the result is laughable .  this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in  " the cat people "  .  i think  " cult of the cobra "  should really be titled  " cult of the contractual obligation "  .  why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow-moving ,  predictable ,  derivative failure like this ?
-1	faith domergue  ( better known as  " dr .  ruth "  in this island earth )  is the only reason to watch this film .  the story is very thin ,  and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game .  see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening .
-1	cult of the cobra is now available on dvd in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie .  unfortunately ,  that is not saying much .   it has a competent cast of second-rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances .  it is efficiently directed ,  entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot .  it looks ok ,  but is ponderously over-plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded .   for example ,  the double cobra attack on the first of the gis was surely one attack too many .   the business about julia choosing to marry pete rather than tom never amounts to anything .  tom immediately falls in love with lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of julia  ( nor is she )  .   julia's 'feminine intuition' is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development ,  but it doesn't .  similarly ,  pete's investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time .   these are just symptoms of the underlying problem .  the movie is structured like a mystery but it isn't .  as soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading ,  so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know .   the ending is particularly lame .  julia is menaced purely by accident .  lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time .  when tom turns up in the nick of time to save her ,  it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all .  he then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done .   it is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that i found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads .  then it occurred to me .  someone said :   " those val lewton movies were very successful over at rko ,  so why don't we make one like that ?  "   cult of the cobra is clearly modelled on cat people :  mysterious ,  troubled ,  shape-shifting woman falls in love with the hero ,  is apparently frigid ,  kills people ,  arouses the suspicions of the hero's woman friend and dies at the end .  but 'modelled on' doesn't mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin .  it copies ,  but doesn't understand what it is copying .   it is obviously trying for the low-key ,  suggestive lewton style ,  but this approach doesn't follow through into the story .  lisa is no irene .  she is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her .  we get a glimpse of her after the first attack in asia ,  so immediately recognise her when she turns up in new york .  there is never any doubt about her purpose .  neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake .   then again ,  during her nocturnal prowling we get ,  not one ,  but two attempts at 'buses' .  neither come off ,  because the director doesn't understand what makes a 'bus' work and ,  in any case ,  they happen to the stalker ,  not the person being stalked .   these faint echoes of cat people give cult of the cobra whatever small distinction it might have ,  but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation .   plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery ,  but i doubt if lewton or tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time-passer came out .
-1	six gis ,  about to be send home and discharged ,  get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia .  surrounded by hooded figures ,  two male dancers pretend to have a fight .  behind them ,  on an altar ,  a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake ,  finally biting one of the dancers on the neck .  the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights .   ( this is definitely a female imitation snake .  )  the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and ,  most definitely ,  no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed .  naturally ,  the gis take a flash photo ,  send the cult members into an angry hysteria ,  steal the basket containing the  " snake "  and run off with it into the asian night .   one of the guys ,  the most offensive and snarky ,  dies from a cobra bite on the neck ,  though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room .   back in new york ,  it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives ,  still maintaining their bond with one another .  their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley  ( david janssen )  to graduate research student  ( richard long )  .  james dobson ,  jack kelly ,  and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood .  richard long has a nice blond girl friend .  kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer .  but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy .   then a dark ,  shifty-looking ,  mysterious woman  ( faith domergue )  shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group .   guess what happens .  first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash .  then kelly gets a visit from domergue .  something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk .  long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that domergue has had something to do with the deaths .  they also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra ,  which is the case .  dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point .   by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled ,  particularly thompson ,  who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him ,  too ,  although he must explain to her what  " love "  is .  no matter .  a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and thompson must throw the snake out the window .  on the pavement below ,  the body changes to that of domergue .  the end .   i think i'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises .  i'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing .  who paid for domergue's fare from somewhere in asia to new york ?  who's paying her utility bills in the hotel ?  who paid for her spectacular wardrobe ?  how come she speaks american english so well ?  what the hell's going on ?  the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton's modest horror films and ,  though not much effort has gone into this production ,  they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton .  in lewton's  " the cat people "  ,  for instance ,  the woman is transformed into a black leopard but ,  with one tiny exception ,  the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it .  most of the transformations here use shadows too ,  but unlike lewton's ,  the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous .   lewton also made occasional use of what he called  " buses "  .  lewton's first  " bus "  was a literal one .  a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps .  something or someone is following her .  she freezes with fright under a street lamp .  something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her .  she looks upward .  there is a loud ,  wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end .  it's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her .  the producers used at least two  " buses "  in this film and they amount to nothing .  a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection ,  for instance ,  and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him .  there is no set up to the shot .  it's jammed in with a shoe horn .   i don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy ,  ugly ,  venomous ,  and phallic .  as a matter of fact ,  no snakes are slimy ,  most are harmless ,  and many are extraordinarily beautiful .  furthermore ,  they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals .  you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity ?  try a six-lined racerunner .  it's a really fast lizard .  when it sees something to eat ,  it rushes up and gobbles it down .   anyway ,  if you want to see some fine ,  low-budget scary films ,  don't bother with this one .  find  " the cat people "  or one of lewton's other minor masterpieces ,  of which this is an obvious copy .
-1	actually ,  this is a lie ,  shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie .  i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago .  didn't bug's life also do that ?  i think it was at disneyworld in that tree ,  so i'm saying before they go and use that as there logo .  also ,  shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios .  they should still consider it as a movie ,  because it appeared in a  " theater "  and you could buy it for dvd .  the movie was cute ,  at least the little flyes were .  i liked iq .  i agree with animaster ,  they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure .  i recommend it to families and kids .
